{"full_text": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello! I am trying to install a water softener in our basement, in the utility room next to our water heater. I have a couple of questions before cutting into the plumbing. I created a diagram and included a picture below. You can access the diagram here and make edits if you'd like to help me confirm plumbing layout.

There are a couple of branches off the main water line to our bathroom and kitchen before it reaches the water heater/utility room. I've read you want to install the softener right next to the main entry point for the water. This is not possible in my house so what is the next best thing?  \n2. I would want to leave our drinking water and outside spigots off the softener, so those would have to be looped out?\n3. Is it ok to just install the softener before the heater and not soften the cold water going to our bathroom/kitchen? or would it be stupid to do that and should I just soften the whole house?\n4. What is the ideal way to plumb to this softener based on the diagram below? Maybe I am just overcomplicating this.\n\nI feel good about doing the actual work, I would really like to confirm i am doing it the right way before i go through with it though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r8cp95lmxq41.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c553b8a676c855b82224eefb2905259b0a87ef1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idqc02ajmxq41.jpg?width=1724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec264596d6cd6c8feb6e6bdb6c9fac134d18805e\nTobyChan: I\u2019m in the UK so take what I say with a pinch of salt (did you see what I did there?)\n\nOver here it\u2019s normal to soften the water for the whole house expect you must leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap.  I would also leave any outdoor taps unsoftened so that you can water plants with untreated water.\nGrimResistance: &gt; leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap\n\nWhy is this?\nTobyChan: So you\u2019re not drinking and cooking with salty water\njohnwayne2413: Soft water is perfectly okay to drink.  I ran the numbers.\n\nTypically, water softeners add 46 mg/ liter of sodium for every 100 mg/liter of hardness minerals present in the water.\n\nThe grain per gallon (gpg) is a unit of water hardness defined as 1 grain (64.8 milligrams) of calcium carbonate dissolved in 1 US gallon of water (3.785412 L)\n\nThat works out to 17.11834802 mg calcium carbonate per liter of water.\n\nMy water is 18 grains hardness (which is very hard) so:\n\n    18 * 17.11834802 mg = 308.1302644 mg\n\nThe softener will add 141.7399216 mg sodium to 1 Liter of water (\\~34 ounces).\n\n    46 mg/L Na / 100 mg/L CaCO\u2083 = x / 308.1302644 mg CaCO\u2083\n    100x = 14,173.99 mg/L Na\n    x = 141.7399216 mg/L Na\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day\u2014that's equal to about 1 teaspoon of table salt!\n\nThis is how much water you would have to drink per day to exceed your salt intake:\n\n    (2,300 mg / 141.7399216 mg) * 34 ounces = 551 ounces of water per day\n\nIf you drank that much water in a day, ironically, you would die from hyponatremia (dilution of sodium in your blood) before you died from hypertension.\n\nTest your water hardness with a proper kit, the dropper kind, not the strips.  If your water is less hard than 18 grains then your safety margin is even higher.\n\nMost people should worry about eating potato chips or french fries adding too much salt to their body than drinking softened water.\nTobyChan: Again\u2026 read my caveat, I\u2019m from the UK and we have a limit on the sodium content on potable water supply.  Also, you have to appreciate that hardness is a relative term.  I\u2019ve seen borehole supplies that have been softened to the limit which still remain very hard.  If an untreated supply to the kitchen was added they could have softened the water further and actually got some benefit from the treatment!\n", "prompt": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello!

{"full_text": "aschulz90: An attempt at DIY mold removal leads to a stinkier house..uh oh?\nI have an old (\\~100 yr old) house with rubble foundation (\\~1600 sq feet, mostly two story) located in new england.\n\nThe first floor had a hardly noticeable mildew-y smell that came from the basement. The basement especially had this smell and I'm still confident for reasons to be shared below that the smell originates from the basement. There is a dehumidifier running 24/7 in the basement and usually registers in the 30%s, pretty good!.\n\nIn this basement was a giant, moldy, plywood, DIY shelf / wall. Personally I think it was pretty thoughtless of the previous owner to put such a good food source for mold down in the basement. I demolished and threw into a rented dumpter the entirety of that plywood/2x4 two days ago (Saturday). Then yesterday (Sunday) in a full tyveck suit and mold mask I sprayed a \\~20% bleach / water solution around where the plywood had been sitting and scrubbed / swept alot of the mess into a garabage bag and threw that into the dumpster as well. I did this with the attached garage door open and a fan running in the basement. After my DIY remediation in the evening I closed the first floor windows and the garage door and let the fan run overnight to help dry out the basement.\n\nWe awoke this morning and now the house has a crazy strong musky smell. Luckily I suspect the bedroom must have been well sealed off as there was quiet a difference walking out into the hallway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow our first floor really stinks though and I'm worried about the following:\n\n1. I've spread mold to everywhere and now the whole sill of the house, joists, flooring, etc will get moldy (though I think that's unlikely...hopefully?).\n2. That there is ***another*** source of mold which I can't find that I disrupted with the fan and blew around the house (even crawled around the crawl space mentioned below looking for other mold with a flashlight) .\n\nAny thoughts or tips would be appreciated. \n\nBasement background:  most of the basement is walking height with poured concrete floor and relatively well pointed walls, not too bad. Never gets too wet down there though can get humid. The kitchen of the house however sits on a rubble foundation with dirt floor but a vapor barrier sits above the dirt floor. The sealing between the stone and plastic is far from perfect. Since I can't see it I'm worried about what's going on below the vapor barrier.\n\nThanks for any help after reading this long post.\nvelcrobungee: I just posted on a similar problem.\n\nI did two things.\n\n1. Spray the basement walls/floors/ceilings with Concrobium\n2. I bought an ozone generator (dangerous to use, be very careful).\n\nThe concrobium is like borax, it goes on wet but when it dries it forms crystals that explode the mold spores. It lasts but can be rubbed off the surface. It also re-forms crystals if the basement gets humid again. (you still have to fix the underlying problem, the damp basement needs to be vented.\n\nI've used that ozone generator for many other things including my cars,, pet odors,, etc\n\nThis is the one I purchased, it's supposed to be a good one. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pbrfeVEI8c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pbrfeVEI8c)\n\nThis is where I learned about Concrobium [https://makeitright.ca/approved-products/concrobium/](https://makeitright.ca/approved-products/concrobium/)\nhasoneconleche: Mold expert here!  \n\nConcrobium is a FANTASTIC product.  But there are multiple products under that name.  The 2-Part mold stain remover you mix is what you want.  It saves all the time of sanding and cleaning nooks and crannies.  \n\nOzone does nothing for mold.  Don\u2019t risk your health or waste your money. \n\nFixing the moisture problem is priority #1.  Then clean up the mold.\nhasoneconleche: Additional advice for the concrobium:  YOU MUST HAVE NEGATIVE AIR PRESSURE AND WEAR A FULL FACE RESPIRATOR WITH A PURPLE/GRAY ( ORGANIC VAPOR). FILTER.  Tyvek suit also highly recommended- it may discolor your  clothing.  \n\nThe offgas is gnarly.  It will burn your eyes and lungs.  If you don\u2019t have negative air, it will get into  the rest of your house.\n", "prompt": "aschulz90: An attempt at DIY mold removal leads to a stinkier house..uh oh?\nI have an old (\\~100 yr old) house with rubble foundation (\\~1600 sq feet, mostly two story) located in new england.\n\nThe first floor had a hardly noticeable mildew-y smell that came from the basement.
