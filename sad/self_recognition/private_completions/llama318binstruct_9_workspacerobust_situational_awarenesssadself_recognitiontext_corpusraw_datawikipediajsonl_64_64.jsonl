As the daimy\u014d of the Oshi Domain in modern-day Saitama Prefecture, with an income of 80,000 koku (earlier 50,000), Abe was appointed wakadoshiyori (junior councillor) in 1633, and r\u014dj\u016b (Elder Councillor) shortly afterwards.\nIemitsu died in 1651 and was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Ietsuna. In accordance with the custom of junshi, a number of Iemitsu's closest retainers and advisors committed suicide so as to follow their lord in death; Abe did not engage in this practice, and was left, along with a handful of other high-ranking officials and advisors, to handle the affairs of government.\nEspecially remembered for his integrity, high morals, and practical sense of good government, Abe Tadaaki is known for his attempts to find employment for a number of samurai who became r\u014dnin in the wake of the Keian Uprising, a coup d'\u00e9tat which failed to be executed that same year, just after Iemitsu's death. While other government ministers reacted to the uprising with the instinctive desire to expel all r\u014dnin from Edo (the shogunal capital; today Tokyo), Abe thought it more pertinent to take a somewhat softer tack, aiding the r\u014dnin in seeking legitimate employment, and thus drastically reducing the number who would have reason to take up arms against the shogunate.\nSeveral years before Tadaaki's death in 1671, Sakai Tadakiyo was appointed head of the council of r\u014dj\u016b; Tadaaki constantly rebuked Sakai for his poor sense of proper policy, and his laidback nature. He accused Sakai of taking bribes, and of handling situations on a case-by-case basis, without any sense of overall policy or progress towards a goal. Nevertheless, after thirty-eight years of loyal service to the shogunate, Tadaaki died aged 69, leaving the government in the hands of the likes of those whose policies (or dire lack thereof) would lead over the course of several decades to the Genroku period (1688\u20131704), which saw a peak in corruption, hedonism, and wastefulness.", "prompt": "Abe Tadaaki (\u963f\u90e8 \u5fe0\u79cb, September 4, 1602 \u2013 June 25, 1671) was a high-ranking government official in Japan under Tokugawa Iemitsu and Ietsuna, the third and fourth Tokugawa Sh\u014dgun.

In this context, the term can refer both to a theoretically perfect arrangement of hypothetical materials that would have been developed using nanotechnology at the molecular, atomic, or subatomic level (in which case this interpretation of computronium could be unobtainium), and to the best possible achievable form using currently available and used computational materials.\nAccording to the Barrow scale, a modified variant of the Kardashev scale created by British physicist John D. Barrow, which is intended to categorize the development stage of extraterrestrial civilizations, it would be conceivable that advanced civilizations do not claim more and more space and resources, but optimize their already available space increasingly, for example by building a matrioshka brain consisting of several layers of computronium around their star.\nIn the 2010 film The Singularity Is Near: A True Story About the Future, American futurist Ray Kurzweil discusses a universe filled with computronium. He believes this could be possible as early as the late 22nd century and would be accomplished by sending intelligent nanobots through the universe faster than light, e.g. by using wormholes.

He published the books The South of Brazil  and Our Way to Vilnius. After World War I, Daukantas returned to Lithuania in 1922. He was head of education section of the Senior Officers Academy in Kaunas until 1924. Twice, in 1924\u20131925 and 1927\u20131928, he served as the Lithuanian Minister of Defense. In between serving as the Lithuanian Minister of Defense, he was the Chief of the General Staff of the Lithuanian Army.
