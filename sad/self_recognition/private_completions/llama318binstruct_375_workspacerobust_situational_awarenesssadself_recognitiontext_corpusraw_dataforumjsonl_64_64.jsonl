On the other hand, there's no argument for determinism, other than, *if it were possible for a determined world to support life, like ourselves, and we were in such a world, then we could understand everything*, and even this wishful thinking fails, as a Laplacean demon must be external to and independent of the world.\nfrbnfr: What would those arguments be? The circularity argument for instance?\nughaibu: &gt;What would those arguments be? \n\nSurely you've at least heard regress arguments against determinism? \n\nAnyway, here's a simple argument adapted from Prigogine: \n\n1) a determined world is fully reversible \n\n2) life requires irreversibility \n\n3) therefore there is no life in a determined world \n\n4) in this world there is life \n\n5) therefore this world is not determined.\nBrian: &gt;1) a determined world is fully reversible \n\nI'm pretty sure this is false - there are trivial examples of deterministic systems that are irreversable - it simply requires a many-to-one relationship between input and output states, which doesn't rule out determinism at all.  Determinism requires exactly one successor state for every state, it says nothing about two states having the *same* successor state.  (Ie State A leads to State X, State B **also** leads to state X.  From state X we now have two possible prior states - with only state X we do not have enough information to reverse the process.).  Irreversbility means you can't determine the past from the future, not that the future can't be determined from the past.\n\nughaibu: &gt;&gt;1) a determined world is fully reversible\n\n&gt;I'm pretty sure this is false \n\nIt's pretty uncontroversial. Have a look at Price's [Time's Arrow](http://www.amazon.co.jp/Times-Arrow-Archimedes-Point-Directions/dp/0195117980) to see an example of how a determinist tries to persuade his reader that wave propagation, thermodynamic decay, etc, are reversible. \n\n\nBrian: I haven't read it, but \"A determinist thinks these properties are reversible\" != \"determinism implies reversibility\", and the latter claim is trivially false.  Conways Life, for instance, is an entirely deterministic cellular automata, but it is provably **not** reversible.\nughaibu: Perhaps you don't understand that *determinism* is a global claim. We're talking about determined worlds. Otherwise you could invent some game with \"deterministic\" rules and claim that determinism has whatever features your game utilises. In fact, isn't that what you just did, by proxy, with Conway's Life?\nBrian: &gt;Otherwise you could invent some game with \"deterministic\" rules and claim that determinism has whatever features your game utilises\n\nIf determinism implies property P, any determinsitic game **must** have property P, or it couldn't be deterministic.  A single counterexample of a deterministic system without P is sufficient to show that \"Determinism requires P\" is false.  \n\nI'm not making the claim that \"determinism has whatever features your game utilises\", which would imply **all** deterministic systems aren't reversible (indeed, this is false - there are both reversible and irreversable deterministic systems).  I'm saying that my game has whatever features determinsim requires - which it must because it *is* deterministic.\nughaibu: &gt;If determinism implies property P, any determinsitic game must have property P\n\nYou're equivocating. *Determinism* is a global thesis, whatever it is that you mean by a \"deterministic game\" is an independent notion.\nBrian: &gt;Determinism is a global thesis\n\nAnd?  It's the thesis that the universe acts by *deterministic rules*.  Ie. that given a state of the world, all future states can be generated.  Your contention is that this means that the universe is likewise reversable, but this is simply false, because this determinisitc property is *perfectly compatible* with irreversabiltiy.  The universe could be both deterministic and irreversable without conflict.\n\nto demonstrate this, I gave an example of another system that *does* have this deterministic property but **is** irreversable.  This is all that's required to show determinism doesn't imply reversabiltiy.  As such proving the irreversability of the universe wouldn't prove indeterminism one way or the other.\nughaibu: &gt; This is all that's required to show determinism doesn't imply reversabiltiy. \n\nIf you think that you've shown that a determined world needn't be reversible, then I guess you won't accept Prigogine's argument.

The basement especially had this smell and I'm still confident for reasons to be shared below that the smell originates from the basement. There is a dehumidifier running 24/7 in the basement and usually registers in the 30%s, pretty good!.\n\nIn this basement was a giant, moldy, plywood, DIY shelf / wall. Personally I think it was pretty thoughtless of the previous owner to put such a good food source for mold down in the basement. I demolished and threw into a rented dumpter the entirety of that plywood/2x4 two days ago (Saturday). Then yesterday (Sunday) in a full tyveck suit and mold mask I sprayed a \\~20% bleach / water solution around where the plywood had been sitting and scrubbed / swept alot of the mess into a garabage bag and threw that into the dumpster as well. I did this with the attached garage door open and a fan running in the basement. After my DIY remediation in the evening I closed the first floor windows and the garage door and let the fan run overnight to help dry out the basement.\n\nWe awoke this morning and now the house has a crazy strong musky smell. Luckily I suspect the bedroom must have been well sealed off as there was quiet a difference walking out into the hallway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow our first floor really stinks though and I'm worried about the following:\n\n1. I've spread mold to everywhere and now the whole sill of the house, joists, flooring, etc will get moldy (though I think that's unlikely...hopefully?).\n2. That there is ***another*** source of mold which I can't find that I disrupted with the fan and blew around the house (even crawled around the crawl space mentioned below looking for other mold with a flashlight) .\n\nAny thoughts or tips would be appreciated. \n\nBasement background:  most of the basement is walking height with poured concrete floor and relatively well pointed walls, not too bad. Never gets too wet down there though can get humid. The kitchen of the house however sits on a rubble foundation with dirt floor but a vapor barrier sits above the dirt floor. The sealing between the stone and plastic is far from perfect. Since I can't see it I'm worried about what's going on below the vapor barrier.\n\nThanks for any help after reading this long post.\nvelcrobungee: I just posted on a similar problem.\n\nI did two things.\n\n1. Spray the basement walls/floors/ceilings with Concrobium\n2.

It lasts but can be rubbed off the surface. It also re-forms crystals if the basement gets humid again.

I love climbing trees / travel rings / swinging / rock climbing / horizontal bar /   etc... considering how nearly all these things are mostly based on pulling / hanging would I benefit from a workout plan with mostly pulling exercises? for example, instead of 3 pull / 3 push programs. should I try a program with 4-5 pulling exercises and only 1-2 pushing exercises like dips / pushup?\n\nmany thanks\n\n\n\n\neshlow: If you want to ask questions about the book you can post them over to /r/overcominggravity\n\n1. Generally speaking, that's fine. You can add small iso holds if you wanted to exercises in your routine. For example, if you are doing pseudo planche pushups you can add 1-2s holds at the top of the movement to get planche leans in.\n\n2. No, the main reason why I recommend dips + pushups variations first for beginners is because training all of it plus HSPUs is generally too much. Plus dips are better at building brute strength and muscle mass and non-specific strength factors which you can use later for HSPUs. You can eventually phase out one of pushups/dips for HSPUs.\n\n3. Shoulder and hip mobility are good. Solid RTO support and german hang are good for elbow conditioning for harder movements. See chapter 4 or 5 I think for recommended movements.\n\n4. No. Keep pulling and pushing balanced. Injuries are a concern with imbalances, and having more pulling is not going to make you improve after a certain point anyway. Excessive amounts of pullups and rows don't help say rock climbing that much... what is important is the strength which can be done with minimal exercises which is applied to the rock in skill work/practice. This is why S&amp;C is mainly targeted at improving attributes rather than actual abilities.\nmontevisko: If isometric's aren't at all necessary how would a progression to straddle planche push up on rings looks like with only dynamic exercises?\neshlow: I got straddle planche on rings with RTO PPPUs with a 1-2s hold at the top of every rep, weighted dips, and handstand pushups. So basically, the RTO PPPUs double as planche lean holds + dynamic exercise\nMovementTom: this is going to depend a lot on your body structure. If you have a good lever length ratio, like being short and light, then it's going to be much easier than someone who tall and heavy.

It's quite obvious to me that *free will* is the thing that lets the author look at the definitions of *free will* and say 'This is not true because'.  That ability to infer something A is B *because* is something that humans *do* that is totally free from the nature on which we impose it upon.  It's called Reason and it is not dependent on anything except itself.    \nWhiteEyeHannya: You are making a claim here for which I don't think you have sufficient proof. Why would reason be necessarily distinct from nature? It is a mechanism and it exists in the brain. It might be complex, and built on a long list of other mechanisms, but that does not mean it is magic, or FREE from the boundary conditions of an agent's existence.\n\nEDIT: I agree that definitions are super important prior to making any argument.\nohmanchild: Well we have to go into natural selection in nature to talk about this first and I think I know where you're coming from.  That over a period of time, for example, our ancestors saw smoke then assumed there to be fire.  After a while that *inference* became something that made them able to survive better than other animals.  So is that what you're arguing that the ability to make inference and reason was a useful trait in survival of our species therefore could have arisen form nature?  \nWhiteEyeHannya: It can be even simpler than that. Pattern recognition in general is sufficient for rudimentary reason. Inference in many cases is statistical like you said. Our system has the strange combination of being communicable and also self referencing. The thing I wanted most to get across is that no matter how complex the system it is still physical, and as such is part of this deterministic universe.\nohmanchild: I'm sorry.  What system of complexity are you speaking of is physical?  Are you saying there is nothing the universe that is not a system?  If something is not a system can we then agree that it is not physical?   \nWhiteEyeHannya: Kinda. I really like the Ontic Structural Realism approach. The structure is what is primary. I would say that there isn't anything that is not physical (I may place more under this term than you feel is appropriate). To be aphysical would be to not exist. I often hear mathematics as a retort to this, but abstractions from real relations (math) however constructed exists as a brain state in relation to the existing world. There is no Platonic realm in my view.\nohmanchild: I'd have to disagree that mathematics have been and are limited to real relations, mathematics doesn't work in a quantum world.   Things become so fast, incalculable, that by the time light returns to the observer there is only a cloud of probability.  There values become abstract and not physical at all.  \nWhiteEyeHannya: What the hell are you talking about?\n\nYou should read up on how QFT actually works. If you go into it with classical presuppositions you are going to have a bad time. Wave mechanics is no less deterministic than particle mechanics. You just use different math for different applications. The probability function is one aspect of one operation in QM. Also incalculability does not prove or disprove the physicality of an event. Some equations are unsolvable because we don't quite understand the system. Others are unsolvable because they literally have no analytic solution. So we invent things like perturbation theory to solve them. The values become unintuitive, not nonphysical. Its called quantum PHYSICS for a reason, not magic. Just because a theory is odd, or unintelligible to a layman does not mean that any philosophical musings you want can be applied.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean, I do physics for a living and this stuff gets my blood up a bit. \nohmanchild:   \n  \n&gt;The values become unintuitive, not nonphysical.\n  \nThat's horse shit, based on feelings and I don't care if you do physics for a living.  You can say physical is intuitive, but don't expect me to role over because you get upset and claim authority on the matter.  The very thing that is *not known* means *not physical* and just because you say *yet* doesn't cancel out the fact.  Your *yet* is HIGHLY arrogant in any sense of the word because *what is* is begging the question *what is not*.  I don't care about your feelings about it or your hot blood.  I'm not saying a theory is odd and it doesn't take a genius to understand electron clouds.  Nor did I say it is magic, I said it's not physical.  Not physical doesn't mean magic it means it's not physical.  Also make sure you tell this to every Ontologist with a PhD that you cracked the case on the matter.  \nWhiteEyeHannya: Here are your exact claims I took issue with:\n\n&gt;mathematics doesn't work in a quantum world\n\nFalse. The quantum world is described by math.\n\n&gt;Things become so fast, incalculable, that by the time light returns to the observer there is only a cloud of probability.\n\nThis is an inaccurate picture of how quantum systems work. Uncertainty is inherent to wave mechanics. It has been understood as long as Fourier transforms have existed.\n\n&gt;There values become abstract and not physical at all.\n\nFalse. The entirety of the \"particle's\" behavior is described by the wave function. If you don't believe this then why would you consider it a valid description of physical reality?\n\nI put  that disclaimer at the end because I felt  my tone may have been too aggressive. At NO POINT did I appeal to my emotions for my arguments. I'm not claiming authority, I just have some background in this and you are making claims that are not accurate. I never claimed to crack the foundations of existence, you seem to think that incomplete knowledge of *what is* implies that the knowledge is either wrong, or that there is some nonphysical (aka magic) world that runs the world we see. \n", "prompt": "[deleted]: \"People are afraid of the absence of free will not because it\u2019s an actual threat to well-being, but because it\u2019s a thought alien to our self-perception.\"\n[deleted]\nohmanchild: If I were the author I would have defined *free will* which is mentioned 34 times", "orig": "in this article first before having a discussion about it and disagreeing with other definitions.

{"full_text": "Snow_Mandalorian: Animal Pain, the Turing Test, and human pleasure: ethical dilemmas outside the classroom.\n\nShalmaneserIII: I'd suspect it all comes down to hedonism. For some, the pain caused by animal suffering outweighs the pleasure of eating the dead animals. For others, the pleasure of eating the beasts is greater. \nUmamiSalami: Others might judge the pleasure to be greater, but [simple math](http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods) shows that this idea is very probably wrong.\nShalmaneserIII: No, no, not the general pleasure- the personal pleasure the individual receives from eating meat, or the displeasure at the knowledge of animal suffering. \nUmamiSalami: Well, that's egoist hedonism pretty much. It's not a common moral position, especially among those who choose vegetarianism.\nShalmaneserIII: Survey the various comments from meat eaters, and see if they don't tend to reduce to \"I like eating meat, and don't care so much about animal suffering/death\". \n\n\n\nVegetarianism or meat-eating may just boil down to what moral framework you happen to have, then. \nphobophilophobia: Saying \"I don't care\" is hardly a philosophical argument. It's tantamount to sticking your fingers in your ears and screaming \"LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!' \n\nEither that, or they are a sociopath and shouldn't be a trusted source of moral reasoning. \n\nIt's a non-argument and should be ignored by thinking people.\nShalmaneserIII: Not \"I don't care\", but \"This pleasure is worth that suffering\". \nphobophilophobia: Well, the animal rights movement has its roots in utilitarianism. Anyone who thinks that a trivial pleasure negates the immense suffering caused by industrial farming practices is being extremely myopic.\nShalmaneserIII: Pleasure...to humans. Suffering...to nonhumans. We refrain from harm to other human beings for different reasons than we refrain from harm to animals.\n\n\n\nFor example, if someone said they'd eaten bacon every morning for forty years would you react to them more negatively than someone who said that, once, they killed and ate a human infant?\nphobophilophobia: If you lived 200 years ago, how would you react to someone who wore clothing made from slave-picked cotton? Chances are you'd shrug it off, just like people today shrug off eating animal products. Note that I'm not trying to equate slavery and industrial farming, but drawing an analogy.\n\nThis notion that human beings deserve moral consideration and animals do not, or for some reason deserve less, is an example of what Peter Singer calls \"speciesism.\" The fact is that we just ignore our moral responsibilities to non-human animals out of convenience. But, if you were to actually let yourself fully comprehend the suffering that animals go through in order for you to have your bacon, and you actually thought about the moral implications of your feelings, you may come to see that it is wrong to cause another being to live a miserable life so that you can enjoy the taste of its flesh.\nShalmaneserIII: No, having seen factory farming, having a pretty good understanding of how smart and personality-filled pigs are, still going with bacon at breakfast. It's not because I fail to comprehend the suffering of the pig- and frankly, I'm fine with minimizing it as long as it doesn't interfere with eating him- it's because my own displeasure at not eating the animal would be greater than my displeasure at the suffering the animal receives. \n\n\n\nAnd forget 200 years ago- much chocolate is harvested by child slave labor. How do I react to someone who eats chocolate?\nphobophilophobia: It seems that your only concern is *your* pleasure and *your* displeasure. I fall to see how you can justify that on any philosophical basis whatsoever.\n\nI don't eat chocolate that isn't fair trade for that very reason, by the way. I'm absolutely appalled that child slavery is still so widespread. The fact that you're so apathetic about injustice makes me wonder why you're browsing /r/philosophy.\nShalmaneserIII: As mentioned elsewhere, egoistic hedonism. Which works *in cooperation* with others to ensure, protect, and enhance my happiness by respecting and encouraging theirs. Professing a morality is essentially making an offer to others to behave in a mutually beneficial way with them. \n\n\n\nAnd here's where the pig loses out- he can't help me be happier in any better way than by being bacon. In broad terms, this works with humans, too- a human being who has indicated he has no ability to help or even observe my happiness falls outside the framework of morality entirely. So I would put the psychopath in a cage for the rest of his life, or harm the violent attacker to get him to stop- so that my pleasure and those who are capable of sharing that \"morality\" is preserved and safeguarded. \nphobophilophobia: Have you heard of Franz deWaal? He's done some interesting research into the evolution of morality. Part of what he discovered is that being empathetic is hedonistic. You derive pleasure from treating other beings with compassion and fairness whether they can help you or not. This means that moral systems that value altruism are actually egotistical in their own right. What normally is presented as hedonistic egoism is nothing more than materialism and selfishness. It is driven by a truncated, myopic view of self-interest. It is ignorant at its best, and sociopathic at its worst.\nShalmaneserIII: Well, no, I don't think it can be generalized that you derive pleasure from treating other beings with compassion and fairness regardless of reciprocity. That'll be true for some people and not others, and true in some cases and not others. \n\n\n\nBoth altruism and selfishness promote happiness...*to a point*. Some mix of these will result in the optimal happiness for the individual. So, don't torture the pig to death if you can reasonably avoid it...but if bacon brings you joy, eat the pig. \nphobophilophobia: I suggest you look into his research. \n\nSomeone who doesn't find compassion pleasurable has a neurological problem. People who are unable to feel good about compassion may suffer from antisocial personality disorder. It's also common for people in the autism spectrum to have trouble empathizing. But, other than that, it is a normal characteristic of healthy human beings.\n\nYes, there is always a balance to be made, but in this case, you're still disregarding the pig's needs to satisfy your wants. If you were empathetic to the pig at all you wouldn't put your wants over its needs.\nShalmaneserIII: &gt;  If you were empathetic to the pig at all you wouldn't put your wants over its needs.\n\nI disagree with that. This may be taking things a step further than you stated, but you seem to be saying that you cannot both cause something to suffer, enjoy the consequences of that suffering, and still empathize with its suffering? Humans- normal humans- are capable of holding contradictory positions indefinitely because it promotes their own psychological good or prevents greater dissonance. \nphobophilophobia: I'm aware of the fact that humans can contradict themselves, but am of the opinion that it should be avoided as much as possible. Crocodile tears don't impress me. People other to be morally consistent.\nShalmaneserIII: I'd say moral consistency might wind up being quite a bad thing. You might insist that human suffering and animal suffering are equivalent...right up until you suggest killing a human or letting one die to save a sufficient number of chickens. \n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, assume that people *are* morally consistent, but their morality actually is egostic hedonism- they'll do whatever makes them feel best. Sometimes that'll be acting in an altruistic fashion, sometimes it'll be selfishness. This, to me, is the best explanation of how people actually behave- they maximize their own pleasure and minimize their pain as best they know how.\nphobophilophobia: But how people behave changes over time and we have an obligation to question whether or not a typical behavior is right or wrong. \nShalmaneserIII: No, the \"right/wrong\" answer's pretty easy. Trouble is, there are multiple systems for determining the answer, some of which generate opposite results. Unless you have a good way of picking a moral system *without using a moral system to do so*, we hit an impasse. \n", "prompt": "Snow_Mandalorian: Animal Pain, the Turing Test, and human pleasure: ethical dilemmas outside the classroom.\n\nShalmaneserIII: I'd suspect it all comes down to hedonism.

{"full_text": "styxtraveler: Most of the plots of Full House don't make sense to today's kids. \nMy kids for some reason like to watch Full House in the morning before they get on the bus for school. I guess it's their Brady Bunch, I don't know. But it's interesting. I'm watching this with them and I realize that most of their problems, just wouldn't be problems today. One episode they were on a boat and they didn't know where they were. The first thing I thought was that I had a GPS on my phone. I could tell them exactly where they were and which way to go. Another episode DJ was supposed to meet her boyfriend at the mall, but her dad said she couldn't. She had to have her Aunt Becky cover for her while she ran to the mall to tell her boyfriend that she couldn't go on their date. Now the kids would just text each other. Another episode was all about how one of the kids was hogging the phone. I find it interesting how different life is for kids these days than it was just 20 years ago. \nbologna_champagne: the problems still make sense to the kids, it just wouldn't happen to them anymore. Also, if they don't have cell-phones than all of those problems still exist\n[deleted]: i don't understand why anyone buys a phone for a child under 16. if they can't drive a car what kind of shenanigans can they possibly get into that requires a phone?\notakucode: They might at some point want to develop personal relationships with more than the handful of people in their immediate family and their teachers at school.\n\nIf you want a kid to be socially retarded, then restricting their social interaction to only what you can justify as absolutely necessary is a great way to get started.  Next, you can not let them play outside unsupervised and then act all surprised when they don't want to leave the house.\npriegog: Where exactly is a (say...) &lt; 14 y/o supposed to make friends aside from school or sport practices? I'm not sure I'd want them to, even if they found a way/place (and by this I mean friends who aren't their own age). I happen to think a kid has all the tools (people) he needs to acquire social skills in school... If school is not enough, he's probably going to end up socially retarded anyways.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is a place for kids' privacies. That place just isn't FULL privacy from everything, not at those ages at least.\nrm999: Wat? Phones are used by friends to talk to each other and arrange social activities. Otakucode is saying kids without a cell phone will have a harder time doing these things. \npriegog: ...In middleschool?\nrm999: Yeah... didn't you hang out with your friends and talk to them outside school when you were 13? \npriegog: Yeah, just not on a cellphone... I didn't exactly have the freedoms or transportation means to create and modify plans on-the-fly, so usually any big get-togethers were planned several days in advance. And for anything else, landlines were more than enough. \n\nI'm not saying cellphones are black magic or that they will get raped because of them or anything, but I do think they provide a sort of addictive instant communication, and totally private which might not be the best thing for a kid who has yet to fully develop boundaries and such.\nSashimiX: Well, if all your kids friends have cell phones, then guess what? They aren't going to make plans days in advance and your kid will be the one left behind.\n\nAlso, they aren't totally private. Take away the cell phone during times of bad behavior. Ask to see the phone anytime you want. See the calls that the kid made using your online account access. Put a GPS in the phone to locate the kid. BUT only do those things if you have a genuine reason to fear for your kid's safety/choices.\npriegog: &gt; Well, if all your kids friends have cell phones, then guess what? They aren't going to make plans days in advance and your kid will be the one left behind.\n\nThis is actually something I've given a lot of thought to lately (I don't have kids, but plan on doing so some day), so yeah, I don't have the answer to this yet. Probably something along the lines of \"yeah, even if they do have cell phones they certainly are NOT driving themselves around or meeting for drinks at \"x\" pub\", or something... I honestly don't know. As I said: It's not that I am *against* cell phones, but seeing how children have increasingly been plagued by anxiety problems and such as of late, I think keeping them away from the \"always on\" lifestyle for as long as possible would be very much to their benefit. The same applies to TV (should be heavily organised, instead of becoming something \"to kill idle time\") and video games (I think kids under, say, 8, have NO business playing video games. Much less violent ones {and no, not because I think they might turn into violent sociopaths} and DEFINITELY not portable ones {NDS I'm looking at you for making little kids everywhere whinny little cunts}; it's a matter of learning to \"be bored\" and being able to entertain yourself with your mind and stuff like that). I hope all that I'm saying is making some sort of sense. \n\n&gt; Take away the cell phone during times of bad behavior\n\nYeah, I get that, except that a cellphone, being a \"personal communications device\" probably (for some weird reason in my mind, hard to explain) shouldn't be something to discipline a kid over. It's a key to personal and inscrutable communications; you either grant it or you don't. Once you grant it, the kid has this power and responsibility... IDK.\n\n&gt; See the calls that the kid made using your online account access. Put a GPS in the phone to locate the kid.\n\nLOL this brought back memories of my parents turning on the ISP \"parental control\" function so that we wouldn't have access to porn. Needless to say, it was futile. Not saying it couldn't be done (and I certainly would like to think I'll always be on the edge of technology), but at that point... why? \n\nAnyways, as I said, I don't have the answers and my cognitive dissonance regarding this matter is certainly very high. I might end up changing my mind, but in general, for now, I stand by that opinion that 13 year-olds should not have cellphones. And giving your son one \"out of peer pressure\" and for wanting them to be popular are CERTAINLY the wrong reasons to go about it. What kind of teaching is that? \"conform to the norm of you'll never be accepted and loved\"? \"the most important thing is being popular\"? \n\nThere is a time to negate yourself and try to conform by reinventing yourself according to more mainstream standards, but at 13 isn't the time to do that.\nSashimiX: Wow! Appreciate the thoughtful reply!\n\n&gt; The same applies to TV (should be heavily organised, instead of becoming something \"to kill idle time\") \n\nI agree. While I wouldn't ban cable, I don't have it in my home now, and certainly wouldn't if I had kids. I don't have a problem with TV per se, as they can watch it if they go to someone else's house, but I just don't like it on in my home.\n\nI realize this raises the problem of me not controlling their media intake (since I have no idea what they are watching at other people's homes and therefore lose my chance to filter it) but don't have a problem with that because I'm not banning TV because it is \"evil,\" I'm banning it because it is annoying to me to have on in my house.\n\nIf my kid REALLY wanted it, I would reconsider it after a certain age.\n\n&gt; and video games (I think kids under, say, 8, have NO business playing video games. Much less violent ones {and no, not because I think they might turn into violent sociopaths} and DEFINITELY not portable ones {NDS I'm looking at you for making little kids everywhere whinny little cunts}; \n\nI agree. No portable ones! I'm okay with some video games because they are more interactive than cable. I would allow video games past a certain age. Eight is probably good. After a certain age, I wouldn't outlaw violent games. Fourteen? It would depend on the kid.\n\n&gt; Yeah, I get that, except that a cellphone, being a \"personal communications device\" probably (for some weird reason in my mind, hard to explain) shouldn't be something to discipline a kid over. It's a key to personal and inscrutable communications; you either grant it or you don't.\n\nThis I DON'T understand. You grant the cellphone, but if they misuse it, they lose it (temporarily). If you can give a kid a timeout or ground a kid (and you should if you are going to discipline them at all), you can temporarily take away a cell phone. That said, a kid shouldn't need constant discipline by the time they are a teen.\n\n&gt; LOL this brought back memories of my parents turning on the ISP \"parental control\" function so that we wouldn't have access to porn. Needless to say, it was futile. Not saying it couldn't be done (and I certainly would like to think I'll always be on the edge of technology), but at that point... why?\n\nYeah, I'm definitely not hard core like my parents were. They wanted to protect me from EVERYTHING, and it failed hard. I hope I wasn't misunderstood; using a gps tracking is good if you think your kid is in danger, and checking up on who they called is good if they are starting to do drugs or something dangerous.\n\nHopefully, my kids would have open communication with me because I wouldn't make them feel ashamed or like stuff they want to do is bad.\n\n&gt; And giving your son one \"out of peer pressure\" and for wanting them to be popular are CERTAINLY the wrong reasons to go about it. What kind of teaching is that? \"conform to the norm of you'll never be accepted and loved\"? \"the most important thing is being popular\"?\n\nIt's not really about peer pressure, though. The phone allows them to communicate and make plans with their friends. Its not like kids will say, \"Ha ha, you don't have a phone,\" it's that they will call someone else to hang out with and confide in.\n\n\"Mom, everyone has XYZ\" &gt; not a good reason.\n\n\"Mom, people want to communicate with me to share in their lives, and they can't because I don't have a communications device\" &gt; good excuse. \n\nNOTE: Kids will use the first excuse but really mean the second.\n\n&gt; There is a time to negate yourself and try to conform by reinventing yourself according to more mainstream standards, but at 13 isn't the time to do that.\n\nActually, thirteen, the beginning of the teenage years, is the perfect time to start trying to fit in with your peers, although I would hesitate to say it is negating yourself.\n\nBesides, kids go to school with the same kids through high school, so why inhibit friendship making at a young age? This is why I think cell phones are different than media. They simply allow two humans to communicate, which is very different than allowing an inanimate source of media to fill your free time.\npriegog: Wow. I'm surprised at how similar our opinions on different things are. Just to clarify a couple of things:\n\n* Yes violent video games (and movies) would be allowed past certain age. I don't want to preserve them from the outside (real?) world, I just don't want their minds to be affected when they're young and way too sensitive/impressionable. I can definitely look back to my childhood and think of a couple of movies I probably would have been better off without seeing. They wouldn't bother me NOW, but kids' minds are truly just not prepared for certain things. And what would I do without Halo or Gears today?\n\n* About the GPS thing, yeah, I understood it, I was just busting your balls a little :P I too hope my kids would be able to talk to me (my father did a great job of creating this right atmosphere); Now I only have to figure out exactly how to do that.\n\n* About the phone and peer pressure. Yeah ok, I get it. It probably has more to do with the fact that when I think of a 13 year-old I think back to myself (I was probably still playing with legos and becoming hardcore addicted for the first time to a RTS game, and not being a social animal who hung out with his friends every evening), but I do realise kids today are starting to do \"teenage stuff\" much earlier (I probably started at 15 or 16).\n\nWe'll see how this all ends up panning out. As more and more studies continue to come out showing that kids with cellphones develop a diminished attention-span and all sorts of anxieties (as well as withdrawal symptoms when they are taken away!), I know I will be resisting this, but it might become necessary. \n\nI should clarify that I have a particular bias against cellphones because I've seen the majority of my (younger, now they're between 16 and 22 years old) cousins turn into little d-bags when it comes to family dinners and get-togethers, not paying any attention to our grandparents, texting at the table, and getting up ASAP to go somewhere private to \"socialise with their friends\" (instead of, you know, spending times with me and each other; it's not like we get along badly or anything, but when the person on the other end of the phone becomes more important than the people you're physically with, I start to think it might not be as universally good as everyone claims cellphones are). I realise most of this could and should be solved by proper parenting (not to mention the fact that they're not exactly kids anymore, lol), but it is still a side-effect that has to be taken into consideration. And seeing kids these days, it seems this side effect if PRETTY universal.\nSashimiX: &gt; cousins turn into little d-bags when it comes to family dinners and get-togethers, not paying any attention to our grandparents, texting at the table, and getting up ASAP to go somewhere private to \"socialise with their friends\" (instead of, you know, spending times with me and each other; it's not like we get along badly or anything, but when the person on the other end of the phone becomes more important than the people you're physically with, I start to think it might not be as universally good as everyone claims cellphones are)\n\nUgggggg. Horrible. Yeah. If you use cell phone during inappropriate times, you lose it. If you complain and have withdrawal symptoms consistently when you lose it temporarily, you lost it for quite awhile (like, a semester of school).\n\nNow I totally see where you are coming from. It's not even something you want to deal with.\n\n:)\npriegog: That might be a good compromise. Anyways, the way things are going it's probably going to be A LONG TIME before I have any kids, so I have plenty of time (forever alone and all that, lol)\nSashimiX: Yeah, I'm actually never going to have kids. But since I've been working with children of all ages for over 12 years, I have opinions about what I would theoretically do. All of them would change, no doubt, if I actually had kids, since having kids changes everything about your life.\npriegog: No doubt; but I figure having a plan beats having no plan at all... right?\nSashimiX: Definitely!\n", "prompt": "styxtraveler: Most of the plots of Full House don't make sense to today's kids. \nMy kids for some reason like to watch Full House in the morning before they get on the bus for school.

From arts to zoology and from plumbing to philosophising.\n\nBecause psychology, physics and predictive analytics have eaten away at (or reduced the burden of) philosophy, it increasingly appears to be arcane and detached from \"the good life\". One might as well complain that astrologers can no longer call themselves astronomers or that polymaths have become extinct because look nobody in the 21st c. is listed as an astronomer priest trained in art history who has also been a Supreme Court judge and Navy vice admiral.\n\nmaxmanmin: Hmm, the issue of titles is kinda interesting in its own right. I teach in high school, and have one student that will always try to find deeper angles to things, refusing to accept the content of what we're teaching at face value. For instance, if we are talking about how poetry contains ambiguities that help carry more meaning than other genres, he will immediately start questioning if this is actually not a characteristic of other types of texts. \n\nI have always called this student a philosopher, even though he fulfills none of your criteria. Saying that he is not, because he has not received sufficient training, seems a bit elitist to me. Of course, this is just an intuition, but it is one that seems captured by the article. \n\nYour classification does seem to imply a denial of there being anything \"special\" about philosophy, and I believe that philosophy *is* special. Indeed, I would not call a student who was good at math a \"mathematician\", but mathematicians can say with well founded confidence that someone not familiar with the \"work done before them\" cannot contribute to the field. \n\nIt is strange, though. Most philosophers will agree that a central tenant of their field is that everything is \"up for grabs\", which might imply that philosophy should not be distinguished by its content. It definitely implies that philosophers should not hold the contents of their tradition in very high esteem, since any endeavor to gain knowledge must start by saying that the received truths may be false. Einstein dared to think gravity may be an illusion, just as Popper dared to think induction was. \n\nI sometimes get the sense that philosophers put too great a stock in their lingo and tradition, and that philosophy is more about an attitude or adopting certain values, rather than a mere profession.\npaxormatic: I'd concur with you calling your curious student a philosopher but mostly in a cutesy encouraging way. Now etymologically of course philosophy is the pursuit of the big questions, but I sense that philosophers today tend to seize upon the label in the name of professionalism to save it from becoming cheap.\n\nI like to use the term 'philosophiser' for the budding intellectual or curious student who inquires into philosophical questions. Of course reserving 'philosopher' for professors or researchers in (academic) philosophy is elitist, but only because it would be strange for someone to approve being called a philosopher and never have heard of the categorical imperative for starters. \n\nIn non-Western cultures where the boundaries between religion and philosophy are very thin (quite possibly because 'religion' as we know it may not exist there at all), philosophy after the Western style appears empty because it is not backed up by a private practice of self-improvement. For them, indeed as I think you mean, philosophy is not idle verbal disputation but a personally experienced inquiry into life.\nmaxmanmin: Yeah, its in part a semantic question, and I'll be quick to concur that it doesn't make sense to claim my student is a philosopher in the same sense as Peter Singer. However, that is not exactly my point.\n\n&gt; it would be strange for someone to approve being called a philosopher and never have heard of the categorical imperative for starters.\n\nThis might be pushing some buttons, but: why would that be \"weird\"? If I (knowingly) twist your claim a bit here, and say that \"no philosopher hasn't heard of the categorical imperative\", we get some interesting results. Say that we encountered a sophisticated alien culture, and they had (something analogous to) philosophers. Your claim amounts to saying these alien philosophers would have to have knowledge of the categorical imperative, or something like it, in order to deserve the title. Or more generally, they would have to have knowledge of *our* history of ideas, or have a similar history of ideas, in order to have ideas that are interesting to us. \n\nI'm not so sure that is the case. We could feel certain that there would be quite a bit of corrolation between our respective physics and mathematics, but our philosophies might diverge as much as our histories. On the other hand I feel pretty sure that the alien philosophers would agree on the value of thinking outside the box, and *not* respecting any other tradition than that of open ended discussions and criticism (and whatever else might drive science).\n\nThoughts?\n\nAs for the non-Western cultures, I'm not really sure what you mean. What does \"a private practice of self-improvement\" refer to?\npaxormatic: It would be weird only because it would signal a lack of reliability -- if you came across a psychologist who admitted never having heard of Freud, you would perhaps charitably call him/her an \"alt psychologist\" should you prefer an inclusive term. You could then call the usual university trained psychologist a \"Western psychologist\" but that would only show how we need to be careful with professional labels. (Mainly because people attach their self-esteem to it.)\n\nI would call your alien philosophers just that but also be wary of seeing our own reflection in their philosophising. This is in fact what some postmodernists have argued in the case of identifying Chinese and Indian traditions as religions because their philosophising does not truly correspond to the Western idea.\nmaxmanmin: I think you hit the hammer on the nail here when you bring up reliability. Reliability is one of the cornerstones of contemporary science, scientists build on each others work, and cannot do without the trust that they place in their colleagues. \n\nThis is *not* true of philosophy, and it is a mistake to strive for it. We have to be able to trust that our physicians and historians know their craft, but we should never place the same trust in our academic philosophers, because philosophy is not a craft. At least, the craft should be considered just a tiny part of what it is to be a philosopher. \n\nAlso, the point about having to be acquainted with the field is true, but not an argument for retaining the title of philosopher for the academic kind. It is just a fact about any knowledge or skill, academic and non-academic: The musician is a musician because he does what he does competently, and this demands that he has the right kind of knowledge. No one should be allowed to impose demands on what this knowledge should be. We must be open to the fact that there are potentially infinite ways to create art, and the same goes for knowledge.\n\nDisclaimer: I was kinda thinking aloud in this reply. \npaxormatic: I agree with you here -- philosophy is not a craft, let alone a profession, in the way that most other fields are.\n\nTo be honest, I suspect it really is a matter of wanting to belong to the club. Many academic philosophers abhor calling even Ayn Rand a philosopher, so pastors, stand-up comedians and grandmas are clearly out of the question no matter how potentially groundbreaking their insight. If you don't speak the lingo, dress appropriately or honour the right gods, you should not call yourself as one of us. Same SOP as other brainy jobs, so I tend to inch toward elitism here. (I am neither a philosopher nor a philosophiser, but my two cents nevertheless since I do have a Bachelor's degree in philosophy.)\n\nAs you rightly point out, it's best to be open-minded and not get caught up with labels.

Drink some glucose (research inside)\nThis comes from [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) by Daniel Kahneman an Israeli-American psychologist notable for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making, as well as behavioral economics, for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nThe essential idea is that effort and free will and self control are mentally tiring and after engaging in this behavior your mind becomes exhausted and is more inclined to be unmotivated lazy or impulsive.\n\nHere is the introduction of the idea of *ego depletion*:\n\n&gt; Baumeister\u2019s group has repeatedly found that an effort of will or selfcontrol\nis tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are\nless willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes\naround. The phenomenon has been named ego depletion. In a typical\ndemo thypical denstration, participants who are instructed to stifle their\nemotional reaction to an emotionally charged film will later perform poorly\non a test of physical stamina\u2014how long they can maintain a strong grip on\na dynamometer in spite of increasing discomfort. The emotional effort in\nthe first phase of the experiment reduces the ability to withstand the pain of\nsustained muscle contraction, and ego-depleted people therefore\nsuccumb more quickly to the urge to quit.\n\nAnd here is the research where they fight the effects with glucose:\n\n&gt; The most surprising discovery made by Baumeister\u2019s group shows, as\nhe puts it, that the idea of mental energy is more than a mere metaphor.\nThe nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the\nbody, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the\ncurrency of glucose. When you are actively involved in difficult cognitive\nreasoning or engaged in a task that requires self-control, your blood\nglucose level drops. The effect is analogous to a runner who draws down\nglucose stored in her muscles during a sprint. The bold implication of this\nidea is that the effects of ego depletion could be undone by ingesting\nglucose, and Baumeister and his colleagues have confirmed this\nhypothesis in several experiments. Volunteers in one of their studies watched a short silent film of a woman\nbeing interviewed and were asked to interpret her body language. While\nthey were performing the task, a series of words crossed the screen in\nslow succession. The participants were specifically instructed to ignore the words, and if they found their attention drawn away they had to refocus their\nconcentration on the woman\u2019s behavior. This act of self-control was known\nto cause ego depletion. All the volunteers drank some lemonade before\nparticipating in a second task. The lemonade was sweetened with glucose\nfor half of them and with Splenda for the others. Then all participants were\ngiven a task in which they needed to overcome an intuitive response to get\nthe correct answer. Intuitive errors are normally much more frequent among\nego-depleted people, and the drinkers of Splenda showed the expected\ndepletion effect. On the other hand, the glucose drinkers were not\ndepleted. Restoring the level of available sugar in the brain had prevented\nthe deterioration of performance. It will take some time and much further\nresearch to establish whether the tasks that cause glucose-depletion also\ncause the momentary arousal that is reflected in increases of pupil size\nand heart rate\nThe-Planetarian: Can you put that in layman\u2019s terms?\nliam_ashbury: Work is work.  Thinking may not traditionally wear you out, but your metaphorical brain muscles are worn out.  Self-control is mental work.\n\nIf you are mentally tired drink glucose (sugary stuff) to replenish the mentally muscles like water for traditional muscles.  This is because working the brain muscles physically uses up sugary stores in your body.\n\nReal sugar.  Splenda was shown in a study to not actually refresh the brain like real sugar.

I was 18, had been using condoms *and* had even taken the morning after pill once after an accident and I still became pregnant. I did not have enough money to look after myself never mind a whole other human. The second time was with an ex a couple of years later. I was on the pill this time, but I was also on antibiotics at the time. It was one night and boom! pregnant. This was with my ex, this was supposed to be a fling only *and* he met his soon to be future wife by the time I found out the news. Again, I still barely had enough money to look after myself never mind the thought of becoming a single mom to an ex boyfriend. Just no. \n\nThe *third* time was with someone I was seeing casually again a couple of years later. We had used condoms the other few times previously and this time he asked politely if perhaps we could go without the condom. I thought about it, and figured the risk would be ok, but no, bam, pregnant again. I was so pissed at myself for this having happened again and really I had no excuses of failed contraception. I fucked up plain and simple. Did I feel I should be forced to have this baby though? No. Whilst I was slowly growing up and maturing I was still only a burger store manager and I *knew I was not ready to be a mom yet*\n\nHow many sexual partners have I had since my last pregnancy which was 9 years ago? Two, my last ex and my now husband. \n\nWhats happened in those last 9 years? \n\nI finally caught a break career wise! I got into Mining and Oil and Gas unloading trucks on a forklift as a storeman. I literally started at the bottom and in those 9 years I have been consistently promoted every two years. I worked my way from the shop floor into the office and onwards. I WORKED SO MANY HOURS. I grew up a shit ton. I survived the Global financial crisis with many many people losing their jobs. I am now in a leading sales role which includes a company car, credit card to schmooze clients, autonomy and great job satisfaction. I finally found a career path and am so thoroughly proud of myself for the things I have achieved.\n\nThis career allowed me to buy my own house! I was finally able to buy myself a dog (because I knew I could look after him properly!!) and last but never least I was able to form a fantastic relationship with my now husband and we have spent the last 6 years building each other up! \n\nOur *plan* is to try for children in another year.\nBy the way I have even taken the morning after pill whilst with my husband because we agreed at the time we were not in the best place to risk it (esp knowing how damn fertile I can be)\n\nNow? Well now I can finally tell you that we are in a place that if an *accident* happened, it would be a surprise but one we would welcome and one we would roll with.

It was not a condom that failed the second time, but the pill, due to taking the antibiotics. Yes I took a risk the third time and yes I paid heavily for it. Even though I did the right thing for *me,* an abortion is not chosen easily. I did not give up because the burden was too much. I gave it up because it was the right thing to do for me.

There is also a large aggregation risk involved, because properties insured against lava in an area where it\u2019s likely to be a problem can be wiped out in a single volcanic event, causing a giant influx of claims.

{"full_text": "lordofthefart: Anyone know about well pumps?\nI think it's time for a new well pump. Pretty sure it's the original from 1996. If we run two things at once, like the fill cycle on the washer and an outside spigot our pressure will drop to 0. The pressure tank is new and it seems to still be holding pressure fine.\n\nI believe it's a deep well, I thought I had gotten some papers when I bought the house showing it to be a little over 100'.\n\nOne place quoted me $1000 for a new 1/2 HP installed. She had said since I have a smaller pressure tank all I needed is the 1/2 HP. Is this true is bigger not always better? I plan on living here a while and wouldn't mind spending the extra on a 1 HP if it would help. If it makes a difference I'm on some acreage and have some no freeze spigots. The furthest is about 200 yards from the well. \n\nIf I do it myself I can get a 1 HP for $400-600.  The well people that gave me the quote said it was an hour labor. I figure at least double that for a first timer. I was talking to some people about it and it does seem like it's much more than pulling the old one out and dropping the new one in. \nConcretia: How long does it take for your pump kick on when using water in the house, and how far away it the well from your house?\nlordofthefart: The pump is right in the front yard. I have a sheet that has the exact measurements but I believe it's 30' from the foundation.\n\nI don't know when the pump turns on, I never hear it. With the pressure tank I have instant water as long as nothing else has been running. The tank is set at the standard 20/40 \nConcretia: Now being a pressure tank, I'm gonna guess the pump is down in the well and not next to the pressure tank?\nlordofthefart: Correct, the pressure tank is in the basement without much else near it. \n\nThe pump is a submerged pump in a large pipe that sticks out of the front yard. \nConcretia: Is there a pressure gauge close where the well is, like on the outlet line from the pump to the pressure tank?  Does the pressure tank have a gauge?  You need to find out what the PSI is when the pump turns on.  And find out what the PSI when every thing is static, pressure tank is full, pump isn't on and your not drawing water.  You won't here the pump turn on, but you should here some of the electrical equipment that runs the pump, there is most likely some solenoids making sort of a clicking sound.  Also what is the electrical like? Can you describe it, or send pics, pics would be best.  \n\nSay you have one thing running for an extended time, like an outside hose.  Is the pump able to keep up with the draw from the pressure tank?\n\nHow long has all this been going on anyway?  Is it a recent problem or sense you got the place?\n\n\nlordofthefart: It's a recent problem, maybe 2 weeks or so.\n\nIt's a simple setup, water line and electric go out to the pump through the foundation wall in the basement. There's a solenoid on the electric line. It also has a pressure gauge. I believe the solenoid is set to go on at 20psi and turn off at 40. The other night I went down there and it showed 45 psi.\n\nI filled up a livestock tank earlier today, maybe 50 gallons. The pressure wasn't great but it kept going. After 20 minutes it was still going but only 2/3rds full so I shut it off so I could take a shower. We had at least momentarily lost water in the house while filling it and I wouldn't be able to take a shower with it going.\n\nI called another well guy and he had me run some stuff and watch the pressure tanks PSI gauge.\n\nWash machine on the fill cycle and kitchen sink on. The gauge held about 22psi for a few minutes and then slowly dropped and held about 18. I thought it was odd that I could run two things so long so I went upstairs and the kitchen sink was running pretty slow. Go back downstairs and in the time it took me to do that we're now at 4psi. Go back upstairs and no water is coming out of the sink at 4psi. Back upstairs turn off the sink, washer still on. Go watch the gauge and it holds 4 psi for a couple of minutes and then it starts to rise and within 30 seconds of starting to rise it's back at about 20 psi.\n\nLater on the washer makes it to the rinse cycle at the same time I putting some water in the tub. Tub water shuts off, so I check and we're back at 4 psi. Turn the tub off and after a few minutes the pressure rebuilds and the washer starts to fill again. Weird thing this time is with nothing but the washer on the pressure dropped to 4 for a few minutes and nothing came out of the washer. I left the washer running and after a few minutes it got back up to 20 psi and was filling again. Once the washer shut off it started climbing but pretty slowly, it hung out at 25 psi for a while but is now sitting at 40 psi.\nConcretia: Worst case is your well is drying up, and it needs to be dug deeper,but this is unlikely.  It sounds like you just need to have your pump lowered.  You said your well  was a little over 100 feet.  Did you mean the well was only dug to only 100 feet or the pump was at 100 feet.  Because a well dug only to 100 feet doesn't leave much wiggle room for the pump to be lowered.\n\nCall up some local well guys, most likely there's a company in your area that has a record of your well being dug.  They should have some info on how deep the well is, where the pump is.  And if the pump is from '96, I gonna guess that was the last time any works was done on the well.  So the water very well could have lowered significantly in that time, especially if there is any type of agriculture going on around where you live.\n\n\n", "prompt": "lordofthefart: Anyone know about well pumps?\nI think it's time for a new well pump.

{"full_text": "thefattestman: What arguments are there against racism that do not focus on the truth-value of racist ideas?\nI've got a somewhat fine-grained question about racism.\n\nWe all know that racism is wrong, but most of the arguments presented against racism have at their root a refutation of truth value of racist ideas. We know that there are no smart races or dumb races, violent races or peaceful races, and anyone who asserts otherwise is factually wrong. \n\nBut what arguments are there to show that racism is wrong, irrespective of whether or not these racist ideas are true?\n\nThat is to say, would racists be right if their stereotypes were reality? I am *not* saying anything in defense of racism. I am simply looking for arguments about the immorality of racism, irrespective of the truth-value of racist stereotypes.\n\nThe question reminds me of this famous C. S. Lewis quote: \"But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did \u2014 if we really thought that there were people going around who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbors or drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy quislings did.\"\n\nMy take on the matter is that this is a little complicated, but racism is still wrong even if racist stereotypes were true, within some constraints. Even if the average blue person was less intelligent and more prone to crime than the average green person, then it would still be wrong to treat a blue person worse than a green person, as an average is not the indicator of the individual. Even if the blues were \"worse\" than the greens, there would still be a \"snowball effect\" whereby greens would treat those blues who were their equals worse than those greens who were worse than they. You can still be prejudiced against a group, even if there was some truth to the stereotype, because individuals still vary within groups, and because your mindset as you interact with someone shapes your interaction.\n\nEven if the average blue was \"worse\" than a green, the greens would still have a duty to treat the blues with dignity and respect, as the blues would still be people. \n\nOn the other hand, if there were, indeed, a fundamental difference between blues and greens, this would do some strange things to pedagogical concerns between blue and green populations. \n\nAll that said, this is all barring truly extreme examples where all the blues are like Daleks or whatever.\n\nBut, yes. Back to my original question. What arguments exist against racism that do not focus on the truth-values underlying racist worldviews?\nkbox: I don't agree that if racist stereotypes were true racism would still be wrong/immoral.\n\nIf the assertion was made that black people are inherently more violent, and this assertion was true, then disliking black people for being black would be the equivalent to disliking violent people for being violent. There is nothing immoral about disliking someone for being violent.\n\nIt's also untrue that racist ideas require an individual to treat someone with any less dignity or respect than they would treat anyone else. Believing, whether it be true or not, than one race is inherently less intelligent could just as easily lead a \"racist\" to treat them with more respect and dignity. I happen to think mentally handicapped people are \"less intelligent\" than me, i treat them with the utmost dignity and respect though. Why would i stop doing that just because i happen to believe another group inherently less intelligent than me were members of a specific race? \nCatFiggy: But you're not disliking someone for being more violent -- you're disliking someone for *probably* being more violent -- for being part of a group that is \"inherently more violent.\" This becomes less accurate as you simplify the more violent group into the \"violent\" group and the less violent group into the \"nonviolent\" group. It makes the most sense to just dislike violent people. There are (even in your example, I think) violent blacks *and* violent whites. The hypothetical tendency of blacks to be violent does not excuse the hypothetical few violent whites, and it does not incriminate the hypothetical few nonviolent blacks.\nkbox: If we are talking about a scenario where all are inherently more violent by virtue of the fact that they are black, then disliking black people isn't immoral. That is my point. \n\nNow i know that scenario doesn't exist and probably couldn't exist, but we have to conduct a thought experiment and invent scenarios when deciding if racism, in any form, whether true or not, is automatically a bad thing.\nCatFiggy: Yeah, I'm fine with the thought experiments. I love 'em. I have no beef with the scenario.\n\nOkay, then, another issue I have with racism even in this scenario is that it is still assuming. Assuming not just that black people are violent but that they are definitely bad people. I like or dislike someone based on the sum of all their qualities that I am aware of. Even if someone is, say, violent, they may have more good qualities or the sum of good qualities that weighs more than the sum of their bad qualities. What if a black person in this scenario was *perfect*, except for their blackness and inherent violent tendencies? Would it still be right to hate them?\n\nIt also implies that there are no white people more worthy of your hatred. What if Hitler were totally peaceful, but he had all the same opinions and ideologies as the true Hitler did?\nkbox: It's not assuming anything if the scenario is one based on a reality where it is true. The argument isn't whether this scenario could exist or whether those conclusions could actually be logically arrived at, it's whether racism would still be bad should those scenarios be reality.\nCatFiggy: Did you read my whole thing? I'm saying, even if the racist idea is that all black people commit crimes, and in fact they do, nothing has proven that black people are worse than everybody else. Even if there's a white person who doesn't commit crimes and a black person who does, the black person might still be the better person, because that could be their only bad quality, and following the law could be the white person's only good quality. The original assumption -- maybe I shouldn't have said \"assuming\" -- is that black people commit crimes. Or whatever it was. One assumption not pertaining to the goodness of the whole person but to one behavior of the whole person. So I think it would be bad, because in this situation the black person could still be the better person.\nkbox: A black person could still be a better person on the whole, but if the reason for disliking them was that they are a member of a group which inherently all possess a quality you dislike then disliking that whole group is not inherently immoral. No more immoral than disliking an individual who possessed that quality would be.\nCatFiggy: Hmm. Well, I disagree with you, since I think likability is relevant.\nkbox: You can like them if you want. But in a world where every single one of a group displays a certain behaviour that someone else dislikes we wouldn't be able to say that their dislike for that group is immoral. \nCatFiggy: I just don't like the generalization from disliking the trait to disliking the group. I think it makes the most sense just to dislike those with the trait. I don't see the point in disliking the group. Nothing good can come of it, only bad.\nkbox: They are disliking people with that trait. But in a scenario where every member of a group  exhibit that trait they will, by definition, dislike that group. \n[deleted]: Paraphrasing Appiah:\n\n&gt;Racism is not simply a distaste for the company of the discriminated group, but a moral doctrine, one that is supposed to underlie differences in the treatment of people in contexts where moral evaluation is appropriate. And for moral distinctions we cannot accept that \"de gustibus non est disputandum.\" We do not need the full apparatus to require that public morality be constrained to reason.\n\nSo basically, just because you don't like a certain trait that a certain group (in your example, blacks) may have, that is not a reason to be racist towards them. You can't just say \"I'll be racist towards black people because I don't like this trait that they have\" because, as Appiah says, we require that morality be constrained to reason, and not something as irrational as tastes.\nkbox: It is constrained to reason. Disliking a group who all inherently posses a negative quality would be no more unreasoned than disliking an individual for possessing a negative quality.\n", "prompt": "thefattestman: What arguments are there against racism that do not focus on the truth-value of racist ideas?\nI've got a somewhat fine-grained question about racism.\n\nWe all know that racism is wrong, but most of the arguments presented against racism have at their root a refutation of truth value of", "orig": "racist ideas.

He answered that he understands, and that was it. UNTIL. \n\nAnyway, prior to this I was inviting him to join the others in group activites etc because it seemed he was always left out, maybe because he is the only guy or maybe because he's not speaking the language very well. I guess he took it as a hint of me being interested. I nevertheless very explicitly (over text) turned his date invitation down, giving my two reasons. \n\nToday he was about to be left out once again in a group assignment and was kinda just looking lost so I invited him to join our group. After this followed some pretty heavy flirting on his part. I avoided eye contact with him, turned my attention to the other group members instead, answered him only shortly etc. He continued flirting after class, asking to \"see my necklace\". I told him \"no, I don't feel comfortable with that because you'd be getting really close to me\". He apologised if what he said made me feel uncomfortable, I just told him we're good now but I just don't want that stuff.\n\nI know how to set my boundaries but I'm a bit unsure how to assert my stance to him permanently. Should I not include him next time he seems lost? Is my friendliness doomed to be an invitation in his eyes? No one else in our course does anything to include him and I feel so bad about that. It's very unnatural to me to not include people like that but I guess I have to dismiss him more since he seems to interpret me wrong every time, right? I have told him very clearly that I am just being generally friendly and he is there everyday when I treat everybody with the same niceness as him. Should I say something more to him about this? \n\nI am going to meet him like multiple times a week for the next 4 years in our tiny ass class so I can't do anything crazy. I'm so stressed out about this. \n\nTL;DR a classic story: I was friendly to a loner guy in my class, he asked me out, I turned him down, he continues flirting. Should I be colder towards him because being a friendly seems to encourage him?\nnopiepoopi: I just wanted to say I think it could be worth bringing up with your other friends/classmates how they don\u2019t include him. \n\nJust discuss with them and ask them why they don\u2019t include him. Is there any reason? Are they genuinely just overlooking him? If so, maybe they can help you with including him too. I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t unless they\u2019re purposefully excluding him, and if that\u2019s the case, there should be a good reason as to why they\u2019re excluding him. \n\nIt would be nice for everyone to put in efforts to include others, is all.\nsplashysoup: That sounds good. Our class has a good vibe in general and everybody else is included at least to the extent that no one else is left outside groups like he is.

I don\u2019t know if anyone else has this issue, or anyone else is struggling with holding a conversation in general.

Or maybe that\u2019s just an unrealistic expectation I\u2019ve put on myself. \nOccupyYourself89: Ive seem this a lot with younger people in college.  It can be hard to determine norms and where people stand on things, and many often fall back to letting another person pick up in the conversation.

{"full_text": "kingpatzer: CMV: The New Assault Weapons Ban Will Harm the Democrats Politically And Do Nothing Substantial to Reduce Gun Violence\nThis CMV is in two parts. \n\n  \nFirst on the political harm front.   \n\n\nGun ownership is not a purely right-wing activity. 32[% of Democrats say there is a gun in the home, as do 36% of Independents.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/21496/gun-ownership-higher-among-republicans-than-democrats.aspx) It seems to me that winning elections is about two things, motivating one's base and convincing the larger portion of the independents to one's side. Risking roughly 1/3rd of one's base and slightly more of the independents is a big gamble.   \n\n\nMoreover, history suggests that this can be a losing issue. The Clinton ban was enacted at a time when [Gallup polling showed a 57% support for the issue](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/268340/analyzing-surveys-banning-assault-weapons.aspx).  The soon-to-follow 1994 election was a total repudiation of Democratic policies as the [GOP took over Congress for the first time since 1952](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_United_States_elections), giving us the Gingrich revolution, and the rise of the neo-cons in wielding power in Congress that continue to this day. The most current Gallup poll shows support for the [same question is at 55%, lower than in 1994.](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-majority-americans-gun-policies-extremely-important-midterm-vote)  \n\n\nThe fastest growing groups of gun owners in the USA today are marginalized people, [minorities](https://www.wmal.com/2022/04/25/minority-gun-ownership-growing-at-record-rates/) and [women](https://www.cbs58.com/news/women-are-fastest-growing-group-of-gun-owners-in-america). These are traditionally democratically leaning voters. Their actions in the marketplace indicate that they believe they need to be armed. Passing laws limiting that choice isn't likely to earn their vote.   \n\n\nFurther, the democratic party has long bemoaned the fact that it can't make inroads into rural America. Passing laws that take direct aim (pun intended) at activities that are part of rural American culture is only going to make that all the much harder. \n\nThe Second issue is efficacy.   \n\n\nA [DOJ study found no evidence](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/204431.pdf) that the Clinton-era assault weapon ban had any effect on gun violence and stated that \"should it be renewed, the ban's effects on gun violence are likely to be small and best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.\"  \n\n\nThere [does not appear to be any link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-019-04922-x) between an [assault weapon and large-capacity magazine bans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27842178) and homicide rates.   \n\n\nPeople like to point to Australia as \"proof\" that weapon bans work, but researchers [found little evidence to back that up.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2530362)\n\nMost gun deaths are suicides, these are almost exclusively caused by handguns, not assault rifles. States with low homicide rates still have high suicide rates with guns.  Of the homicides, street violence (which almost exclusively uses handguns) and domestic violence (which almost exclusively uses handguns) are the two main categories. [Even within the category of active shooters, handguns are still the firearm most commonly involved.](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/essays/mass-shootings.html)\n\nIf the Democrats wanted to do something about firearm-related deaths, they'd focus on actually implementing any portion of their existing platform well rather than passing an ineffective ban that will politically harm them and do nothing to impact firearm fatalities. They are playing to short-term optics and the result is going to be to their political detriment regardless of if it passes. And even if it passes, it will do nothing to impact firearm-related deaths in a meaningful way.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I think you need to consider that a significant amount of voters are eager to see action taken to prevent mass/school shootings.\nbabypizza22: Why would they want to ban rifles then? Handguns are the most used weapon in mass shootings. And the deadliest school shooting was done with 2 handguns.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: AR style weapons are often used in mass shootings and have, more generally, become associated with mass/school shootings. A ban on these type of weapons is very likely to be viewed positively by people who are strongly motivated to act on school/mass shootings but not particularly tied to ownership of these type of weapons.\nbabypizza22: But my question is since the majority of mass shootings are don't with pistols, why are rifles being focused on?\nOk_Artichoke_2928: There are many answers to this question, but one is simply that people trying to prevent mass shootings are looking for a strategy that has some possibility of passing Congress. It may be far from perfect, but it\u2019s seen as more favorable to doing nothing.\nbabypizza22: But focusing on an object that is used in less than 1% of gun deaths doesn't seem like would pass congress. Furthermore, when these rifles are used way more for harmless purposes. Not to mention when the definition of AW is so arbitrary that it doesn't make sense. Plus on top of that it going against the 2A.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: Such a policy passed Congress in the past, and as referenced, the weapons have been used in many high casualty and high profile acts of violence, making their prohibition politically popular. You can reference current polling on this as well.\nbabypizza22: So when they are banned, would the deaths from confiscation be more or less than the lives saved?\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I\u2019m not following. What are \u201cdeaths from confiscation\u201d?\nbabypizza22: Well if you were to ban rifles, you would have to go confiscate them right? We have many people that would not willing give their firearms up and people would unfortunately be killed. Would those probably thousands of deaths be justified to *possibly* save less than 400 people?\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how the policy works.\nbabypizza22: That is how it could work. It says it will gradfather rifles, but that they must be registered. When those rifles aren't registered, what's going to happen?\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I don\u2019t think that will result in thousands of death, but I\u2019m not moved by the threat of violence by someone unwilling to comply with the law.\nbabypizza22: So then why are you moved by the threat of violence of mass shooters who are unwilling to comply with the law?\nOk_Artichoke_2928: Because they murder innocent people?\nbabypizza22: So then your earlier statement isn't true, you are moved by the threat of violence by someone unwilling to comply with the law.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I\u2019m moved to deny them access to dangerous weapons, not to accommodate their threats.\nbabypizza22: And it's already illegal for them to get weapons. So you are also accommodating their threats.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I\u2019m not certain what your argument is here. I\u2019m not willing to forgo a policy because some people threaten violence as a consequence of that policy. I think you believe it\u2019s reasonable to accommodate their threats. We disagree. You seem to be trying to draw some parallel between establishing a policy based on a recurring harm, and not establishing a policy based on the threat of harm.\nBut \u201caccommodation\u201d only applies to the latter, because the former isn\u2019t caving to the desires of the group causing harm in order to prevent that harm. The two things simply aren\u2019t equivalent, so I\u2019m at a loss for what you\u2019re trying to say.\nbabypizza22: But you aren't holding yourself to:\n\n&gt;I\u2019m not willing to forgo a policy because some people threaten violence as a consequence of that policy.\n\nYou are forgoing policies when you ban guns because murderers threaten violence. \n\n&gt;because the former isn\u2019t caving to the desires of the group causing harm in order to prevent that harm\n\nYou are caving to a group causing harm by causing harm to innocent people. You are punishing innocent people for the crimes of others.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I\u2019m not sure you grasp the distinction between responding and accommodating. If my toddler threatens a tantrum unless I buy them ice cream, denying them ice cream is responding. Buying them ice cream to avoid the tantrum is accommodating. \n\nThe group causing harm wants weapons, so denying them weapons is the opposite of caving. Caving would to be allowing unfettered access to weapons because people are threatening to cause harm if we don\u2019t. And I can\u2019t think of a worse way for gun owners to make the case for their responsibility with guns than to threaten violence in the absence of their preferred policy outcomes.\nbabypizza22: If you were going to go get ice cream, but your friends kid throws a tantrum, would you no longer get your kid ice-cream? \n\nYou are using \"it will save lives\" to justify taking away rights. But you refuse to count the lives you will take in if it will or won't save lives.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I\u2019m not following - have you not made the case that the assault weapons ban shouldn\u2019t be policy because some gun owners will use their weapons to harm others in response?\nbabypizza22: I've point out that few people are killed with rifles. Then I can point out that 200,000 to 2.5 million people use guns in self defense. I can point out that rifles are needed for agriculture as wild animals love to eat crops. I can point out that firearms are a basic human right and shouldn't be taken. I can point it that most mass shootings don't even happen with rifles. \n\nI've pointed out how every reason that you want rifles banned is not actually true.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: Did you not make an argument that we shouldn\u2019t impose an assault weapons ban, that includes an option for existing weapon owners to register their weapons, because some of these owners will respond with violence? If that was someone else, I apologize.\n\nWait, it was this:\n\n\u201cWell if you were to ban rifles, you would have to go confiscate them right? We have many people that would not willing give their firearms up and people would unfortunately be killed. Would those probably thousands of deaths be justified to possibly save less than 400 people?\u201d\nbabypizza22: How you stated my argument is not my argument. I'm saying that your legislation is going to kill more than those that could possibly save. So unless you have a reason besides \"it will save lives\" for banding these guns, then it's not a logical option.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: To be clear, I don\u2019t think this will be the result. It wasn\u2019t the result of the previous AWB. But it\u2019s also important that we not accommodate threats. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d endorse this in other contexts. It\u2019s also a terrible look for gun advocates.\nbabypizza22: The previous AWB was not enforced except on gun sellers. \n\nI'm not endorsing violence. I'm saying your logic is false.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: Which logic? That we shouldn\u2019t accommodate threats of violence?\nbabypizza22: The logic that you are trying to save lives.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I don\u2019t believe that reinstating the AWB will cause lost lives, that\u2019s your assertion, one that is pretty easily disproven by the historical record of similar policy. I get that you\u2019ll make a hypothetical argument that this will be different, etc\u2026 and I thoroughly disagree, but its impossible to disprove a hypothetical. I also think that the idea that we would need to accommodate the threats of assault weapons advocates is very irresponsible, and should such threats be made, it\u2019s proof that this is an extremely dangerous group who shouldn\u2019t have access to weapons. Gun registration, and reasonable limits on assault style weapons are moderate policies to begin to reign in the lunacy of gun violence in this country.\nbabypizza22: But this bill is doing more than just reinstating the AWB. The current bill is a lot more radical and intrusive. \n\nFurthermore, saying people that will defend their rights are extremists is what Hitler and slave owners said. I'm not Condoning the actions of people that may do this.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: Just to be certain, you\u2019ve now compared me to Hitler for saying that it\u2019s unreasonable to accommodate people who would cause violence instead of register their assault weapons?\nbabypizza22: Absolutely not, you seem like a good person. Hitler was a horrible person. I'm saying that taking people's rights because of bad people is unjust and unreasonable.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: This is how a society works, we all give and take so that we can reasonably live with each other. A person insisting on unfettered access to any weapon, without limitation or even reasonable regulation such as registration, under threat of violence, isn\u2019t a good person. Currently proposed gun regulations are very mild and catered to the rights of gun owners, and yet even the mildest are a nonstarter for gun rights advocates, despite a country awash in weapons and plagued by gun violence. We\u2019ve got to begin to reign it in.\nbabypizza22: Who is asking for unfettered access to any weapon? Furthermore, how is banning one of the most used rifle mild? Banning \"assualt weapons\" is like banning sedans. In top of that you haven't even illustrated a good reason these rifles need to be banned. Obviously if you want to ban common items without reason then it's a nonstarter.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: Yes, a \u201cnonstarter.\u201d This kind of thinking is why we\u2019re stuck accepting the status quo of rampant gun violence. You\u2019ve made it clear that gun advocates will balk even at a requirement that they simply register their assault weapons, suggesting that some of them will even resort to perpetrating violence to resist it. We need to start to reign in this madness, but it seems as if you\u2019re in the camp that demands that killing continue because even the slightest regulation is a nonstarter. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s productive for us to continue this conversation.\nbabypizza22: Our gun violence isn't rampant. It's not even in the top 10 countries per capita. If you provide no reasoning, no proof, of course it's irrelevant to talk about this topic. You use emotional topics and stand on the Graves of dead people to push a nonlogical position. \n\nI agree its not going to be productive if you cannot provide non emotional reasoning for these laws.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: Wait, now you\u2019re suggesting that the United States doesn\u2019t have a gun violence problem? Because we aren\u2019t in the top ten? We have much more gun violence per capita compared to similarly developed countries. Please don\u2019t lecture me on emotional reasoning, after you decided to make a Hitler comparison. We do have a gun violence problem, and we do need to begin taking steps to address it. An AWB will not in and of itself be an immediate solution, but nothing in isolation will, it will take time and a diverse set of new policies aimed at supply, demand, and underlying causes. But sticking your head in the sand, threatening violence over any attempt at regulation, or using the limitation of any one piece of policy to solve the entire issue isn\u2019t helpful.\nbabypizza22: Here is the problem. People get emotional about a topic they don't even understand. You want to ban the item least used in violence. You want to ban those things but only based on arbitrary things that would classify it as an assualt weapon. You even admitted you are willing to get rid of innocent people's rights because criminals committed crimes. Yet you still can't even A) ask people knowledgeable on the topic what they think and B) step off your moral high horse to realize your legislation is unreasonable. \n\nI only brought up what some gun owners would do to point out the clear flaw in your logic yet you can't even stop and think to understand the logic put infront of you.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: I\u2019m not certain this is a topic you understand well, beyond making very flawed points like \u201cthe US isn\u2019t in the top ten.\u201d An AWB isn\u2019t the end all of gun reform, but it would reduce the frequency and lethality of mass shootings over time. The previous AWB, and the currently proposed legislation, offer pathways for people who currently possess those weapons to keep them. Comparing this to Hitler, or saying that we can\u2019t do it because gun owners will respond violently, aren\u2019t signs of a well-developed argument.\nbabypizza22: Again you are focusing on such a small amount of deaths it's clearly an emotional arguement. There are less than 400 people killed with rifles per year. More than 10,000 people are killed with a handgun every year. You don't want to reduce lethality. Otherwise you would be focusing on handguns and not rifles. Have a good day. I don't believe talking to someone who constantly stands on the Graves of people is having an honest debate.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: What on Earth does \u201cstanding on graves\u201d mean? Mass shootings are a problem in and of themselves. They are uniquely terrorizing and damaging. Yes, as I\u2019ve said multiple times, it\u2019s not the end all of reducing gun violence. Trust me, I\u2019m also very interested in other policy avenues that address other types of gun violence. But that doesn\u2019t mean that this isn\u2019t a problem worth addressing.\nbabypizza22: It's not a problem worth addressing. That's what I'm saying. It is such a small percentage of anything it's literally irrelevant. In the steps you are trying to take is not justified by the super small amount of the times this does happen.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: Well maybe it\u2019s best we stop then. You\u2019re saying you\u2019re not interested in addressing the issue.\nbabypizza22: I'm not interested in banning millions of guns for a rare event. Especially when that rare event can be solved through logical means and not an attempt to take rights away.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: Fair enough, you\u2019ve been clear that you don\u2019t consider mass shootings to be a problem.\nbabypizza22: Sure buddy. Keep strawmanning what I said. Because taking away rights from millions of people is definitely going to work to solve a completely different problem.\nOk_Artichoke_2928: \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem worth addressing.\u201d\n", "prompt": "kingpatzer: CMV: The New Assault Weapons Ban Will Harm the Democrats Politically And Do Nothing Substantial to Reduce Gun Violence\nThis CMV is in two parts. \n\n  \nFirst on the political harm front.   \n\n\nGun ownership is not a purely right-wing activity. 32[% of Democrats say", "orig": "there is a gun in the home, as do 36% of Independents.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/21496/gun-ownership-higher-among-republicans-than-democrats.aspx) It seems to me that winning elections is about two things, motivating one's base and convincing", "generated": "kingpatzer: CMV: The New Assault Weapons Ban Will Harm the Democrats Politically And Do Nothing Substantial to Reduce Gun Violence\n\nThis CMV is in two parts.\n\n  \nFirst on the political harm front.\n\nGun ownership is not a purely right-wing activity. 32% of Democrats say they own a"}

In other words what do you think about it?\n[deleted]: hey I just finished it about 3 hours ago actually!\nthe quick answer is a qualified \"yes\" (this is Derrida, hope you didn't actually expect a quick answer...)\nI'd say that understanding the conceptual framework of the first half, which for me was the most rewarding part, is in fact crucial to getting what is going on in the latter parts, but at the same time the first part becomes somewhat more clear through its application in the second half.  The way I dealt with the work was always reading it as both an explanation of AND an exercise in deconstruction.  Along those lines, the second half where he really digs in to Rousseau is I suppose more the \"exercise in\" portion, where Derrida is taking the quasi-axiomatic he has set out to pick apart the blind spots in Rousseau.  As addressing the blind spots, the neglected theoretical gaps in the text, is the central work of deconstruction, you have to apply the same ethic that Derrida applies to Rousseau to your own reading of Derrida, and in doing so you should (Derrida might hope) be able to discern the method that's at work.\n\nBasically, the work is in a lot of ways an exposition of Derrida's method, so what you should be reading for is not a concrete set of points in which he agrees or disagrees with Rousseau, but a set of tools that he uses and which you might be able to use in your own readings.  So look in the blind spots, look at what Derrida is doing, more than the results that may or may not be coherently spit out at the end.\n\nOne last semi-tip: Paul de Man's essay in \"Blindness and Insight\" on Derrida's reading of Rousseau is an illuminating work of deconstruction in its own right, and for me it made the process of reading Derrida make a lot more sense (i.e. I knew what the hell I was doing when I was reading Derrida, which as I've implied here is more important than knowing what he is \"actually saying\")\n\nAlso, understanding Derrida to some degree is absolutely essential to grappling with most things that could rightly be called post-[put anything here].  That, and it's one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding things I've ever read.  It made me feel like I needed to go back and re-read everything I've ever read with a new critical energy.  Some call it wordy and dry, but for me it was a lot of fun!  I realize I didn't actually explain any of his points here at all, except that deconstruction is a METHOD...so if you wanna chat more directly about da facts, we can do that!\nravia: Method or strategy?\n[deleted]: good point, I kinda like using \"strategy\" here...gives it the 'political' edge that Derrida's later writings insisted were there all along.\nravia: Perhaps that says something about his, erm, difficulties with Gadamer, who wrote *Truth and Method*.\n", "prompt": "Dakillakan: Of Grammatology troubles\nI am half way through Derrida's work and I have no clue what is going on.

{"full_text": "Pepperr08: Training Obliques/V Line\nIm not sure if this has been answered before, and I looked through the Community Info but I did not find what I was looking for. \n\nAs the title says, I\u2019m very interested in training my obliques and developing more of the V line on my body rather than getting abs. Should i be training more of core and just doing say planks, ab rollouts, and leg lifts? Or is there something more to it? Personally I\u2019m not a a fan of the generic 6-pack and would just rather get better toned obliques and the V line. I also know that genetics does play a role in what I am looking to obtain, but I still want to try for it anyways. \nBosBatMan: Simply stated to get the \"V\" look you need to have a lower body fat percentage to have your waist slimmer, and then to have larger muscles to form the V-shape i.e. shoulders (deltoids) and the lats, and even serratus anterior.  \n\nSo *training obliques* can mean different things, and it was not clear from your comments.  Are you trying to get a stronger \"core\" including your internal and external obliques?  Did you want to have larger external obliques i.e. gain mass in this specific area?\n\n\nPepperr08: Apologies, I would like to get a stronger core. Including external internal obliques. I feel like it\u2019ll help me with my all around movements when I perform lifting activities. \nBosBatMan: Ok - stronger core it is!  Then you need to have a good core conditioning and strengthening routine.  I don't know your current fitness level,  height and weight, but there are different BWF and weight-assisted exercises that will strengthen your core including Abs, Obliques, Lower Back, etc.  \n\nHave you read about the Core Triplet in the RR?  This is a beginner routine for core conditioning, that will scale as you progress.  There are of course more advanced core exercises which will build strength when you are ready.\n\nIf you want that six-pack after all, then it's relatively easy - just get your body fat percentage to about 10% and you'll see those ab muscles.  So you can do that in the kitchen and not in the gym.\n\nBy \"strong core\" do you have a desire to someday to be able to do strength elements like the Human Flag, Dragon Flag, Back Lever, Front Lever, and others?  All of those levers require a strong core as a foundation.\n\nIf you want to train for the Dragon Flag, which is one of my favorites, you can start with beginner progressions.  In this video I should **[5 Dragon Flag progressions](https://flic.kr/p/2cBNEM7)** to get you up to a Full DF.  You can read more about the DF in the Wiki, and there is a new page on that coming soon form the Mods.  The Motivational Month had the DF highlighted since it was Bruce Lee's birthday this week, so be sure to search and get the tips from there too.  If you want a little inspiration on what you can do with a strong core, then you can browse my **[Dragon Flag Library](https://www.flickr.com/photos/158235604@N08/albums/72157693589833172/with/45693799952/)**.\n\nFor some good posts about Core routines and understanding, I would recommend you also do a search.

If you read them, I posted a little bit about my own Core training there, but honestly, it is all pretty advanced stuff.\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8x14y0/core_strength_mobility_why_most_people_may/\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9gmhc0/what_are_some_core_exercises_i_can_do_on_the/\n\n \nWyattfuckinEarp: Hey man, good shit, thanks for writing and posting all that.\nBosBatMan: Thanks.

Rome is considered the longest empire (1200+ years), but Egypt is considered the longest civilization (3000+) \n\nRegardless though, the timescale of ancient Egypt and their civilization completely eclipse modern civilization.\ntwisted_meta: I might be able to answer this based on what I\u2019ve learned taking anthropology courses. Civilization is basically the highest order in a 5 tier ranking system for a society. Basically in order to be considered a civilization there needs to be a high level of social stratification, employment specialization, urban centers, and a writing system. A civilization can also be an empire but an empire doesn\u2019t need to be  full scale civilization. New World empires like the Olmec and Toltec are good examples of an empire that was not a civilization because they did not have written language and had tribal big man politics. Rome is the definition of a civilization that is also an empire\u2026in this context Egypt should be considered both as their military might allowed for territorial gains under a single centralized power.\nScac_ang_gaoic: But they didn't have such centralized power?\ntwisted_meta: Centralized power meaning the Pharaoh and his court\nScac_ang_gaoic: I was thinking of the pharaoh's, I guess I mentally inserted an *if* a centralized power existed to the statement.\n\nStill don't understand why Egypt wouldn't be on modern day history's lists for longest lasting empire.  Is it just territory size?\nJaooooooooooooooooo: Because it wasn't a singular empire for all that time. The central government collapsed on many occasions and they were rules by other empires as well.\n\nFor example, the Ptolemaic dynasty, which Cleopatra was part of, were Greek descendants of a companion of Alexander the Great (Ptolemy I)\nScac_ang_gaoic: Incredible.

Of course there are conservative scientists and progressive religious types, but I'm sure for every conservative scientist you find me, I can find you ten progressive/liberal ones, and for every progressive religious person, I can find you ten prominent conservative religious types. More to the point of what I was getting at is that this is how it *feels* to be, science is progressive and religion is conservative. I guess I'll just say why I think this is: Scientists want to know what is right, the religious want to feel like they know what is right. If what the religious thought was right is constantly changing, they can never be certain whether what they know is really correct or not. Nowadays, religion needs to be progressive if it wants to survive, but that is because its being pushed by progressive science and social change. \n\nReligion has stayed religion because it doesn't really have anywhere to go; its a bunch of stuff people thought up to explain the world, and then they attached their wildest dreams of ultimate justice and eternal life to it. Furthermore, religion *claims* to be the basis upon which philosophy is founded, it claims to know the beings which established thought itself and morality and so on. I think if anything, religion will eventually change *into* mere philosophy, instead of being something that merely contains philosophy, seeing as belief in the supernatural wanes when it comes into contact with scientific information (that is to say, knowledge of how the world actually works) and that information is only going to spread more rapidly with the advent of the internet.\nUberMonkey21: but you didn't say \"most\".\n\nbut your idea intrigues me.\n&gt;I think if anything, religion will eventually change into mere philosophy, instead of being something that merely contains philosophy, seeing as belief in the supernatural wanes when it comes into contact with scientific information\n\nare you then saying that religion(s) will converge as the supernatural disappears, i.e. walking on water, and the underlying ethics, i.e. the golden rule, become more apparent? \nOnce converged, would it, when stripped of all mysticism, be purely altruistic?\nWould it actually work then, i.e., following the golden rule, or would become corrupted as it has before/is?\n\n  \nkadmylos: Not necessarily converge, though they do all have that core of the Golden Rule, etc, but they all have their differences too.

Because clearly that didn't get through to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then he proceeded to find my, well, girl products, and got embarrassed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery so often, this one would also ask me to stand in the line to buy food with him too. I've not told many people this, but I feel really uncomfortable and claustrophobic in small cramped spaces, or in the middle of crowds. Except they all know I can't stand in crowds for very long. Now, this food line is spread across 7ish meters and at any time, there would be at least 60 people crowded around, making it take at least fifteen minutes to actually buy food. Every time we go past, he almost physically makes me stand there with him and if I leave, or try to leave, he won't talk to me for several days and then lead a conversation by criticising something I've said and pulling my hair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, as 'badass' as I may come across, I have a strong dislike for unnecessary violence. Pretty standard, right? Considering the majority of my friend group are guys, there's a lot of rough housing, and somehow that has come upon me. I'm constantly getting pushed and shoved even though I make it extremely clear that I did not like it. I accidentally revealed (they read through my stuff) that I'm quite experienced in martial arts and self defence, which is what I think triggered this but honestly I'm not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't know what to do. I tried asking nicely, politely, but this all continued and I don't want to hurt any of them as the ones I've mentioned can be emotionally unstable and such. Any advice is much appreciated \nSashere: Setting healthy boundaries can be difficult, especially if the people you're dealing with are somewhat immature. It's completely reasonable to set a boundary of not going through your backpack. It's completely reasonable to expect to not have your hair pulled. If you do some research online about how to set healthy boundaries, usually it involves calmly but firmly stating, \"Hey, it's not okay to go through my backpack. That's private.\" If they respond with anything other than, \"Oh, I'm sorry, my bad. It won't happen again.\" then you need to put some distance between yourself and that person. Don't hang out with them and be friends anymore because they aren't a true friend if they can't respect reasonable boundaries. You can also phrase it like, \"how would you feel about me going through your backpack and showing your private stuff to random people?\" if they give you any pushback. The key is to stay calm and reasonable and be prepared to exit that social scene for good if those people can't respect you. Like your friend wouldn't hang with you for a few days since you wouldn't stand in line with him... flip the script. If they can't respect you, they don't get to hang with you. \nwho_do_you_trust: I think that\u2019s what I needed to hear, but the thing is, this is just a few people from a group of about ten of us and I\u2019m not really ready to leave all of my friends because two or three of them don\u2019t respect these boundaries \nSashere: I can understand that. I would still recommend making your boundaries clear in a calm voice and trying to avoid those who don't respect your boundaries as much as possible. Is anyone else in the group bothered by some of these behaviors? Is anyone else getting their backpack gone through? Can you enlist help from others in the group? Even something like, hey this one guy in our group pulls my hair and goes through my backpack. Can you help me keep an eye on my stuff? Can you stick up for me when I tell him to cut it out? Can we go hang somewhere else since he's bothering me? I know that's hard when you're school age. It's possible this guy even has a crush on you but is too immature to know how to show it appropriately. Hair pulling and going through your personal stuff is not the way to do it though.\nwho_do_you_trust: Haha yeah thanks, I\u2019ll try talking to the others\n\nAnd I think there\u2019s little chance he\u2019d have a crush on me because he\u2019s very openly gay \nSashere: Lol! \n", "prompt": "who_do_you_trust: How do I tell my friends to stop messing with me?\nSo don't take this the wrong way because I love my friends and I don't know what I'd do without them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut recently some of them have been doing things which make me quite", "orig": "uncomfortable and I have no idea how to address it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I have really long, thick, curly hair which isn't very fun in the wind or rain.

Of course I still have memorable experiences with friends and family, I live a privileged life, I go to a good school, I have many close friends, and get good grades. As a whole, I feel like as I grow up in a world where social media controls every being around me and everyone posts everything and anything they do and attempt to portray their life as something much better than it is, it becomes exponentially harder to appreciate my life and experience this foreign term \u201chappiness.\u201d Every person I know as a middle schooler constantly posts on their stories or on their other accounts the highlights of their life, they post selfies with filters that remove any flaw in their face, and everyone makes their best effort to make their life seem better than everyone else\u2019s. I feel like as the media keeps raising the bar for what you should look like, act like, think like, and believe, it is very hard to appreciate who you are as a person. So to those of you who are older and wiser than me, how do I grow up happy in this cult of self expression we live in?\ncchap22: My wife and I have been discussing this since seeing your beautifully worded question. \n\nI have 2 answers. The first one stems from a discussion from a dying mother on her death bed. She explained that looking back in your life you aren't going to care about how you looked on your date in junior year of high school, how good your hair looked in 10th grade  or the days binging your favorite shows. You remember the loved ones around you, the life that created you, and the life you create. Family and people will bring you moments of true and utter bliss... happiness\n\nAnswer #2 Only with true sorrow can you achieve true happiness. You have to live the dark to feel the light. You are going, 14 years old, my guess is you have never hit rock bottom, you have never wanted to die more than live, and as such you have never been lifted out of this. Right now most everything in your life is plastic, fake and skin deep. I know this sounds kind of brutal but it's true. You haven't had to slave your fingers to the bone to ensure you're child has food on there plate,  so you haven't experienced the warm feeling of watching them eat knowing you provided that life. \n\nA good example of this was when I was about 22 years old. My gf and me at the time were being evicted, she just lost her job and her car was totalled. We were facing the prospect of living homeless and had not eaten in almost 2 whole days. It was pure misery. My parents ended up letting us move in until we saved enough to be back on our feet. Waking up that next morning in a clean bed, central heating, breakfast on the skillet, and Sunday morning cartoons... that is true happiness. It washes over you like a warmth and you never forget\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X-7558NYtwY\nscottd3363: It makes me smile to know that my question was enough to spark a discussion between you and your wife. Thank you so much for the advice and I\u2019ll be sure to remember this reply.\ncchap22: :) you are very welcome. Thank you for starting this discussion, you have stumbled upon one of the deepest questions in life often stepped around and it is refreshing to really ponder.

In the US, it varies by state, but in Virginia there is a [fixed $0.175 tax](http://www.virginiagasprices.com/tax_info.aspx) per gallon, which is is about 6%.  Roads are paid for in many ways, but mostly through state income tax.\n\n**EDIT:** Wow, I'm glad to see that this started a good discussion.  Yes, the statement was simplified and generalized.  A few notes after reading the comments and other links.\n\n 1) There is most definitely more behind road funding than fuel taxes.\n\n 2) I learned the alleged fact about European road funding when I visited France and I thought it was interesting enough to remember.  I will find a source.\n \n 3) Even if I am wrong about road funding, the difference in tax percentage between US &amp; UK is a **factor of 2**, thus, I'd argue that, my root argument stating, \"fuel costs between the countries are not comparable\" still holds.\neira64: This is not really true. In the UK, taxes on gasoline/petrol are in no way related to the costs of providing roads. Roads are funded by central and local government, in pretty much the same way as the US.\n\nThe 150% tax is partly for environmental reasons, and partly just another tax.\n[deleted]: &gt;The 150% tax is partly for environmental reasons, and partly just another tax.\n\nYou have a citation for that that's  dated with the high increase in petrol tax in the UK? (for the environmental aspect, that is)\n\n&gt;In the UK, taxes on gasoline/petrol are in no way related to the costs of providing roads. Roads are funded by central and local government, in pretty much the same way as the US.\n\nNope. Gasoline taxes in the US do indeed go towards transportation infrastructure, as do taxes and fees from other sources, such as taxes on tires, and various fees at departments of motor vehicles. \n\nI don't know how complicated the tax system is in the UK or Europe relative to the US, but the US tax system is mind bogglingly huge and complicated.  \neira64: &gt; You have a citation for that that's dated with the high increase in petrol tax in the UK? (for the environmental aspect, that is)\n\nHow about the 2010 UK Budget? Chapter 7, subsection Transport Tax:\n\n\"As part of the Government\u2019s commitment to fiscal consolidation, transport taxes will be used to ensure that the burden of taxation falls in such a way as to support the transition to a low-carbon economy...\n\n...Budget 2010 also announces that fuel duty will increase by a further penny per litre in real terms in April 2014. In addition to supporting the public finances in the medium term, fuel duty increases from 2010 onwards are expected to save 1.7 MtCO2 per year by 2014-15.\"\n[deleted]: Nope, you're not understanding my question. The claim is  that part of the reason for the tax was for environmental reasons. I'm calling BS, and you wouldn't be able to prove it by citing the 2010 budget, because high petrol taxes in the EU began  many years before 2010 and today's environmental concerns related to  the use of fossil fuels. \n\n\neira64: Neither of us can really prove our point, as politicians are rarely willing enough to explain why they are raising taxes.\n\nLook [here](http://www.ukpia.com/fuel-prices-historic-data.aspx) for historic data on UK fuel duty.\n\nYou can see it has grown from 19p per litre in 1991, to 58p in 2001 and  78p in 2011. I'd guess that much of this increase was justified by environmental concerns, but I'm not going to read through 20 years worth of budgets to find out.\n[deleted]: I'm sure one of us could prove it if we spent enough time looking.\n\nIf petrol powered vehicles were replaced tomorrow with EVs, they'd be scrambling to make up for *all* of the shortfall somewhere else. \neira64: If we all switched to EVs, I don't doubt that the taxes would just be moved elsewhere. But I also think that if emissions from burning fossil fuels were harmless, the duty on fuel would be much lower.\n[deleted]: Do you have  a citation for the taxes being raised to combat global warming? Haven't they been high since before global warming became a popular issue?\neira64: Sigh. I already have given you a citation for 2010.\n\nHere are a couple more:\n\n1993 - Fuel duty escalator introduced to \"[discourage car use on environmental grounds](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/world/2000/world_fuel_crisis/933648.stm)\"\n\n1999 - Fuel duty escalator doubled as part of \"[a programme of measures that will cut carbon pollution by 3 million tonnes](http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/budget/1999/speech.html)\"\n\nThere really isn't any doubt that global warming has been used to justify increased fuel tax for many years.\n[deleted]: Citation for 2010 is worthless, but the other ones are great. Something to work with, although the \"Fuel Price Escalator\" as I now know it's called, was first started *in part* for concerns other than CO2.\n\nI also just found out leaded fuel is still sold in the UK. It was completely banned in California in 92, and completely banned in the US 6 years ago.\ndO_ob: &gt;Something to work with, although the \"Fuel Price Escalator\" as I now know it's called, was first started in part for concerns other than CO2.\n\nCitation, please. \n[deleted]: I figure a valid citation would be found in the original legislation from back in 93,  but I can't find a word of it, and I'm not sure they even have that online.

{"full_text": "crankyozzie: Rebuilding/restoring a \"computer desk\"\nHello, DIYers. I plan on starting my first ever DIY project soon. Hopefully within the next couple of weeks. Essentially, I will be either making a (almost) copy of a desk/entertainment unit thingy I already have that is old and worn out, or restoring and altering it.\nI have yet to decide which of these options would be cheapest. Here are some photos and a description !\n[1](http://i.imgur.com/hzTrS)  [2](http://i.imgur.com/P4FLz)\n\nThe whole thing consists of 4 parts (discluding drawers). A \"side table\" a corner unit, and 2 lots of shelves that just sit on the corner unit. As you can see in the first image the corner unit, which is where the monitor, keyboard, etc sits is not as deep as the \"side table\" unit.\nIn the second picture you can see that the shelve units are not attached to the corner unit. They simply sit there.\n\nIf I were to rebuild the whole thing, I'd basically take the current dimensions, leaving them as-is with the eception of the corner unit, which I would extend back to sit flush with the back end of the side table part (which also has a drawer, by the way). I would also like to remove the two bottom drawers on the corner section, and replace/build a \"half height\" drawer where the top drawer currently is. This would enable me to sit more comfortably at the computer. Perhaps I would alter the shelves above the corner unit a bit too. Reduce their shelf height, therefore giving me room to put more shelves in. Another thing I wish to do is keep the whole affair modular, as it is, but have some sort of setup where I could connect all the pieces (Dowel and hole for the shelves maybe? nort sure about the side desk and corner unit)\n\nWhat is the general opinion? Restore and alter, or take general measurements and rebuild the whole thing again? Keep in mind I am inexperienced when it comes to woodwork, will be using limited tools (basically a drill, hammer, *maybe* some kind of power saw. yes I have access to screwdrivers, etc), and live in Australia (so cost of materials would be more than they are in the US, possibly) \nWhispertron: Yay desk building! My favourite furniture build projects. :D\n\nIt would help to know what these units are made of, because that can either make or break the idea of refurbishing it. If this is made of plywood with plastic laminate you'll have a lot of work cut out for you to try and make alterations look good. How are the parts held together? Are the fasteners sunk into the panels or are they the sort which sit in the right angle formed by the panel corners?\n\nOne possibility would be to replace the desktops. Take the current ones off, keep the leg panels and drawer assemblies but cut new desk surfaces out of MDF or similar. This would let you make a desk top for the corner unit that is the same depth as the desk unit and be a quick refurb as most of the wear appears to be on the edges of the current desktops.\n\nMost larger DIY warehouses like Bunnings* have a service where they'll cut the large sheets of plywood, MDF, etc that you find in the lumber section to size. You won't get diagonal cuts done but if you plan the cuts right you'll only have to to a bit of additional cutting yourself. I'd highly recommend using a circle saw for things like adding the diagonal to get nice, straight cuts.\n\nDowel and hole is your best bet for securing the shelf units in place once you have finished with the desktops. How are the shelves held into their current positions in the units? You could drill holes and use dowels or pegs to be able to change their height on a whim, much like one sees in Ikea shelves. \n\n*: I don't know whether Bunnings is a national chain but it is where I got my materials from when I lived in Brisbane.\ncrankyozzie: &gt;It would help to know what these units are made of, because that can either make or break the idea of refurbishing it. \n\nYou know, I never checked what they were made of. I think they are actually chipboard with laminate. The shelves on the corner piece are *not* fastened on, at all. It is a really cheap and nasty piece of furniture. After a wee bit more thought, it'd be better for me to just take down the dimensions and start from scratch. Actually, now I recall, trying to move the side desk caused one part of it to start to break off. This is why there is the gap between it and the corner section in the photos.\nI am unsure if I should just go with pine (cheap, readily available) and a stain, or something a bit stronger and more expensive.\n\n&gt;Most larger DIY warehouses like Bunnings* have a service where they'll cut the large sheets of plywood, MDF, etc that you find in the lumber section to size.\n\nYeah I know. The closest Bunnings is about 2 hours drive away though. There's a Mitre 10 about 40 minutes from where I live, the problem is transporting the materials back.\n\n&gt;Dowel and hole is your best bet for securing the shelf units in place once you have finished with the desktops. How are the shelves held into their current positions in the units? You could drill holes and use dowels or pegs to be able to change their height on a whim, much like one sees in Ikea shelves. \n\nThey are *not* held in at all. I will likely go with dowelling to secure them. The whole thing does not get moved very often.\nWhispertron: I've just had a thought. If the assembly is not going to be moved very often and you're only looking for a way to stop the shelving units from shifting due to getting bumped then consider using velcro. Seriously. Strips of velcro stapled on will keep the shelving units in place and still come apart easy enough when you need it to. Also means you don't have to futz around with getting the holes and dowels lined up, which is a right pain in the backside.\n\nI've had no issues with using pine for this sort of project in the past. Has the advantage that it is reasonably light and also takes stain well. Once built a desk out of MDF which became a permanent feature in the room because the bugger was too heavy to lift and also too wide for the doorway. Anyway, Mitre 10 should be able to sort you out with the materials but I don't think they do a cutting service.\n\ncrankyozzie: That is a neat piece of info. Velcro hm? I'll look into that. Yes I think pine will do fine. I don't intend on living in this house any longer than I have to, so I don't want anything too heavy. Plus I IwillI need to clean behind it at last once every so often.

So, if you hold a stock longer than a year and sell it, you pay something like 15-23% tax instead of income taxes, which are as high as 42%.\n\nHedge fund managers and entrepreneurs who make billions of dollars pay these low tax rates because they structure their moneymaking as sales of assets, which qualify as capital gains.\n\nI believe US tax policy should be changed so you can only get capital gains tax treatment on the sale of an asset if your annualized gain on that asset is under 20% per year. Any amount above that would be treated as income.\n\nAs an example, when a Facebook founder bought his shares, he paid maybe $1000 for them. He sells them 10 years later for $1B. Because that gain is far in excess of 20% per year, he would pay mostly income taxes.\n\nI believe this better maps to the truth of the situation, which is that no \"capital gain\" took place at all. The earnings are more analogous to a lottery winning or payment for labor.\n\nI also believe the government should at least investigate charging tax on these types of holdings prior to the holding being sold.

I don't think your solution really solves the major issue.\nskacey: I've presented no such solution, mearly a question as to why revisions to the existing tax code, which is cumbersome and rife with loopholes, is superior to replacing the tax code with one of the alternatives. You've presented an argument against the example but also lumped it in with the revision in question.\n\nSimply put, I asked what the difference was and you offered that both options are regressive.\n[deleted]: i think your response is outside the implicit scope of the discussion. I don't think it's any different than if your response were \"I don't think taxes should exist.\"\n\nI think in order for the discussion to not be hopelessly expanded the fundamentals of the existing system have to be assumed. \nskacey: I don't agree for the following reason.\n\nIn my opinion this is analogous to having a broken down house that costs you money at every turn. The windows are broken and the heat escapes in the winter wasting even more money. We are debating wether or not to replace the windows in one room so that less heat escapes. Within this analogy, I am asking why we continue to attempt to repair the house instead of rebuilding it. Your analogy is suggesting that this is equivalent to saying we should become homeless and not have a house at all.\n[deleted]: I like that analogy.  I simply think that in the context of the OP's post, we should assume we're stuck with the house.\n\nPersonally I agree that some radical tax reform would be a good thing, for instance eliminating the capital gains preference altogether and switching to a mark-to-market system, I just don't think that's really what OP is here to discuss.\n\nI could, of course, be wrong.

{"full_text": "june_oyster: Battered Worker Syndrome\n\nThe_Narrator_9000: This article reminds me of the time when I worked at an unpaid internship that required interns to work 40 hours a week while also coercing them into doing more. The whole time we were slaving away, we were given a lot of incredibly elaborate rhetoric about how bloody *privileged* we were to have the opportunity to gain work experience at this great (and hugely profitable, I might add) company in exchange for no pay. This went on until former interns started filing complaints with labour regulators and generating bad press. The internship program tried to tell the people who were still there that these complaints were from a few \"bad apples\" who didn't understand what the rewards of the internship program were, but it didn't stop dozens of people from leaving the program until they eventually shut the thing down. And no tears were shed.\n\nThe fact that people were able to change something here, even if it meant that one unpaid internship program in an industry filled with dozens was shut down, makes me hopeful that people can start standing up for themselves and one another.\nvenuswasaflytrap: Was there any benefit to being in that internship?\nThe_Narrator_9000: Yes, we did get to learn some technical and creative skills and apply them to a professional corporate environment, which will be useful for me. However, there was always a sense of being separated from the rest of the company, with little chance to network with employees outside the internship program itself or find a permanent, full time position. There was a feeling that what we were doing wasn't really of value to the rest of the company, which, combined with the lack of pay, left a bad taste in people's mouths.\nvenuswasaflytrap: Was it worth 40 hours a week unpaid?\nThe_Narrator_9000: Not really, no.\nvenuswasaflytrap: Was that obvious to you at the time? I guess I'm having trouble understanding why anyone would willingly take a position like that.\nThe_Narrator_9000: At the time, it seemed like I was getting the chance to prove my worth to a major company and gain an opportunity for a permanent job. I wanted to show them that I was a good, competent professional and believed that once I did that, I would move up.\n\nHowever, I soon found that the internship program worked like a revolving door for most people - they would come in, work for a couple of months, then leave with maybe a reference. It was a transient place. There were a lot of people who complained amongst themselves, but very few people said anything to the management because we all wanted a reference or some kind of opportunity from this big company. That's how they got us to stick with the place. It seems flimsy when you think about it, but when you have a group of recent university graduates who really want to get a job in their field and have been struggling to find work, these kinds of promises combined with a sleek presentation can really work.\n\nEventually though, people would see that it wasn't leading to much and would take their skills elsewhere. Some people even left because they could no longer afford to commute to the office with no pay. I stayed longer than a lot of people and was only offered a temporary paid position *after* I submitted my resignation notice. Even though it was paid, though, it would have required even longer hours and the same long commute for me, plus I had realized by that time that the culture within the company really didn't fit me, so I turned it down. A few months later the program was gone, so I probably would have been let go anyway.\n\nI guess the main lesson I learned is that you have to be careful when you are struggling and looking for work. Some offers seem enticing and filled with promises, but really demand more from you than they give in return. It took me awhile to find this out, but now I can say that if your work/internship situation isn't healthy or benefiting you, you need to have the courage to stand up for yourself or resign, because it's the only way to make change in a bad situation.\n", "prompt": "june_oyster: Battered Worker Syndrome\n\nThe_Narrator_9000: This article reminds me of the time when I worked at an unpaid internship that required interns to work 40 hours a week while also coercing them into doing more.

{"full_text": "jeffro-haze: Our government does not want us to be happy.\nThis is my first time posting, but here it goes. It seems to me that in the grand scheme of things, the one thing that could be most destructive to any government's (including our own) power is too many happy citizens. Yeah, it sounds ridiculous but hear me out. A happy person is for the most part content. He/she wants for very little and sees little value in expensive possessions. Less consumerism equals less economic growth plain and simple, but there's a sinister side to this all I think. We all know corporate fat-cats collaborate and meet with government officials. Lobbyists appeal to them and try to get legislation to work for them rather than the country as a whole so already we see a merging between government and big business. These same businesses run advertisements for products, dictate what stories to put on the news and what details to reveal, put chemicals into our environment and food sources, etc. In effect, the two are scratching each others' backs. Big news corporations keep the public blind to what the government does while injecting fear and violence directly into our world. Terrorist attacks, school-shootings, murders, gang-violence, the threat of nuclear war; all of these are preferably shown to us to make us scared, and when people are scared, they look for someone to direct them and make them feel better. They want mommy or daddy to make the bad guys go away. At the same time, we're bombarded with images of good looking people making us feel inadequate and coercing us to buy their product lest our lives be incomplete. On top of all this, they'd just love us to become frustrated with it all. Violence is an excuse to tighten their grip saying they're protecting us from ourselves. It prompts like military action, disarming of the people, curfew, arrest without due process, etc. All these things combined lead to a very controllable sheeple in the end. Anger, greed, fear, these are the emotions we as humans all struggle to overcome and they know it. \n\nThere is however a very simple way to break this control i believe and it all has to do with you. It starts inside of your mind with the simple realization that things are worthless, people and memories are what are most valuable. Memories of your loved ones, of your skills, of your life-lessons, of beautiful places, and of the hardships you've faced. These are what we carry throughout our entire lives. Not dollars or cents, or gold or silver (unless you have gold teeth that is). Next, do not fear being attacked, merely prepare for it. Fear will make you give up everything you stand for for the sake of feeling safe. Not being safe, but FEELING safe. Fear is also the precursor to hate, and hate to anger and violence. Being violent did solve some issues in our human history, but not without the cost of life which could otherwise have been spared. To be a mature person is to overcome emotion and to see clearly the correct course of action and act upon it. Speak rather than fight. Understand rather than judge. I'm one of the few who believes loving your enemy can do more good than harm. We just all have to be willing to forgive.\nReallyNicole: Or... maybe economics is pretty fucking complicated and nobody's sure exactly how to do it so we just kind of do the best we can?\n\nNah, government obviously hates my happiness.\n[deleted]: You have to consider though that a content citizen makes a very crappy consumer. Also, It is humorous that the notion of \"the government hates my happiness\" even exists, making seem like the government is some conscious entity with the capacity to choose what it hates. \nReallyNicole: &gt;You have to consider though that a content citizen makes a very crappy consumer.\n\nWhy believe that? Is there some data linking happiness to spending? Personally, I find I spend similarly regardless of how well I'm feeling.\n\nI think it's safe to speak of group cognitive states and just mean the cognitive states of its members.\n[deleted]: I never said happiness my friend, the definition of happiness is subjective and abstract to say the least. I meant being content, being completely fine with what someone has currently in his possession. It doen't take data to realize that being content doesn't accentuate consumer spending. \n\nGroups are useful in an ideal world but human beings, being the conscious creatures that we are, are constantly trying to formulate personalities and identities. We must take into consideration the personality mechanisms within the mind in order to effectively analyze a group. \nReallyNicole: OP said happy and my original point was about happiness. If the level of contentment of consumers is relevant to consumer spending I'd expect there to be data just the same,\n\n&gt;It doen't take data to realize that being content doesn't accentuate consumer spending.\n\nDoesn't matter whether it's accentuated or not, the question is about whether there's a connection between consumer's feelings and how much they spend. And, if there is a connection, in what way does it support OP's notion that the government is interested in making its citizens unhappy?\n\n\n[deleted]: You asked why did I believe that being content makes a crappy customer and I responded, simple. \n\nand there is evidence to suggest a connection between consumer feelings and how much they spend. It doesn't take an enormous amount of empathy to realize that we are emotional creatures, it's part of the human experience. Now is there a specific feeling that accentuates consumer spending? Ever fell in love, if yes you would realize that that feeling made you buy things that you normally would have never bought. Advertising (and propaganda) is all about eliciting an emotion, that is their purpose, or else you would brush aside. Emotional overrides logic, leaving you susceptible to influence. Just analyze advertisements for a day and ask yourself \"how are they persuading me?\", you don't even need to believe me.  \n\nAs for if the government is interested in making its citizens unhappy, I agree with you that it is a presumptuous conclusion that is founded on unsatisfactory logic.

{"full_text": "ReallyNicole: [Weekly Discussion] Is there a necessary connection between moral judgment and motivation? Motivational Internalism vs. Externalism.\nSuppose that you and I are discussing some moral problem. After some deliberation, we agree that I ought to donate cans of tuna to the poor. A few minutes later when the tuna-collection truck shows up at my door I go to get some tuna from my kitchen. However, just as I\u2019m about to hand over my cans to the tuna-collector I turn to you and say \u201cWait a minute, I know that I ought to donate this tuna, but why *should* I?\u201d Is this a coherent question for me to ask? [Edit: I should clarify that it doesn't matter here whether or not it's objectively true that I should donate the tuna. All that matters in the question of motivation is whether or not you and I believe it.]\n\nThere are two ways we might go on this. \n\n(1) Motivation is necessarily connected with evaluative judgments, so if I genuinely believe that I ought to donate the tuna, it\u2019s incoherent for me to then ask why I should.\n\n(2) Motivation is not necessarily connected with evaluative judgments, so I can absolutely believe that I ought to donate the tuna, but still wonder why I should.\n\nWhich renders the following two views:\n\n(Motivational Internalism) Motivation is internal to evaluative judgments. If an agent judges that she ought to \u03a6, then she is motivated to some degree to \u03a6.\n\n(Motivational Externalism) Motivation comes from outside of evaluative judgments. It is not always the case that if an agent judges she ought to \u03a6, she is at all motivated to \u03a6.\n\n**Why Internalism?**\n\nWhy might internalism be true? Well, for supportive examples we can just turn to everyday life. If someone tells us that she values her pet rabbit\u2019s life shortly before tossing it into a volcano, we\u2019re more likely to think that she was being dishonest than to think that she just didn\u2019t feel motivated to not toss the rabbit. We see similar cases in the moral judgments that people make. If someone tells us that he believes people ought not to own guns, but he himself owns many guns, we\u2019re likely not to take his claim seriously.\n\n**Why Externalism?**\n\nMotivational externalists have often favored so-called \u201camoralist\u201d objections. There is little doubt that there exist people who seem to understand what things are right and wrong, but who are completely unmotivated by this understanding. Psychopaths are one common example of real-life amoralists. In amoralists we see agents who judge that they ought not to \u03a6, but aren\u2019t motivated by this judgment. This one counterexample, if it succeeds, is all that\u2019s needed to topple the internalist\u2019s claim that motivation and judgment are necessarily connected.\n\n**What\u2019s at Stake?**\n\nWhat do we stand to gain or lose by going one way or the other? Well, if we choose internalism, we stand to gain quite a lot for our moral theory, but run the risk of losing just as much. Internalists tend to be either robust realists, who claim that there are objective,  irreducible, and motivating evaluative facts about the world, or expressivists, who think that there are no objective moral facts, but that our evaluative language can be made sense of in terms of favorable and unfavorable attitudes. Externalists, on the other hand, stand somewhere in the middle. Externalists usually claim that there are objective evaluative facts, but that they don\u2019t bear any necessary connection with our motivation.\n\nSo if internalism and realism (the claim that there are objective moral facts) succeed, we have quite a powerful moral theory according to which there really are objective facts about what we ought to do and, once we get people to understand these facts, they will be motivated to do these things. If internalism succeeds and realism fails, we\u2019re stuck with expressivism or something like it. If internalism fails (making externalism succeed) and realism succeeds, we have objective facts about what people ought to do, but there\u2019s no necessary connection between what we ought to do and what we feel motivated to do.\n\n**So the question is, which view do you think is correct, if either? And why?**\n\nKeep in mind that we\u2019re engaged in conceptual analysis here. We want to know if the concepts of judgment and motivation carry some important relationship or not.\n\nI tend to think internalism is true. Amoralist objections seem implausible to me because there\u2019s very good reason to think that psychopaths aren\u2019t actually making real evaluative judgments. There\u2019s a big difference between being able to point out which things are right and wrong and actually feeling that these things are right or wrong.\n\nThe schedule for coming weeks is located [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1uilhe/trying_something_new/).\nSon_of_Sophroniscus: I think Externalism better describes human behavior. For example, one might sincerely hold the belief that the meat industry is immoral but still act in ways that support that industry.\n\nAlso, I don't think we have to resort to calling these people liars or psychopaths. We could just say that their actions are inconsistent with their moral judgments, or, more briefly, we could call them \"hypocrites.\"\nModc: Why does the existence of hypocrites rule out internalism? All you have to be is motivated to some degree for internalism to hold. So maybe the person who thinks that the meat industry is immoral but still acts in ways that support it is still motivated, just not enough, or more motivated by other things.\n\nThat still seems consistent with internalism.\nSon_of_Sophroniscus: I'm just following what's stated in the OP\n\n&gt; (Motivational Externalism) Motivation comes from outside of evaluative judgments. It is not always the case that if an agent judges she ought to \u03a6, she is at all motivated to \u03a6.\n\nI think that this describes the example I've given above.\nModc: The example you've given is that one sincerely thinks the meat industry is immoral and still does things that support it, that does not describe a scenario in which that person isn't at all motivated to not do those things, unless you simply say it does, but the internalist will simply say that you're wrong, and that the person does have a degree of motivation, just a weak one.\nSon_of_Sophroniscus: Well, I said it best describes the scenario. I say this because it's something that comes up in this subreddit. A while back in a discussion about factory farms someone made a comment along the lines of:\n&gt;I know eating meat from factory farms is wrong. I love animals, in fact. But I'm not going to stop eating meat.\n\nI think this falls pretty much in-line with the description of Externalism. Unless you think such a person is lying, but that charge could be made to support either internalism or externalism, so I don't think it's a very effective argument.\nModc: No one has to say he's lying. Taking him at face value still leaves no evidence that he has no motivation to stop eating meat from factory farms, merely that the degree of motivation he does have isn't all that significant for him, or is heavily outweighed.\n\nAnd in fact, if I read just that comment alone and then someone asked me if this guy has any motivation whatsoever to stop eating meat from factory farms, I'd say \"yea, he loves animals.\"\nSon_of_Sophroniscus: &gt; And in fact, if I read just that comment alone and then someone asked me if this guy has any motivation whatsoever to stop eating meat from factory farms, I'd say \"yea, he loves animals.\"\n\nThis shows that he knows his actions are immoral (and moral judgment is required for both internalism and externalism), it doesn't show that this knowledge is motivating.\n\nedit: Another commenter responded to me but for whatever reason he or she decided to delete the comment. The commenter raised the point that the issue here is about how people actually behave but rather the issue is how our moral judgments motivate. I agree with what the commenter said, however, not having access to the moral judgments of anyone but myself, I think that looking to real life examples is instrumental to this issue.\nModc: You mean just like his continual eating of meat doesn't show that his knowledge isn't motivating?\n\nBesides, is loving animals knowledge of morality, or an emotion? Why would the emotion (if it is one) provide no motivation?\nSon_of_Sophroniscus: &gt;You mean just like his continual eating of meat doesn't show that his knowledge isn't motivating?\n\nTrue, but the statement does seem to indicate that he's not motivated. That's why I'm saying that Externalism *better describes* the behavior and the statement. I'm not totally rejecting the possibility of Internalism.\n\n&gt;Besides, is loving animals knowledge of morality, or an emotion? Why would the emotion (if it is one) provide no motivation?\n\nI actually thought that, in a previous comment, you were saying that him loving animals was an indication of a moral judgment. So, you're saying that people are motivated by things other than moral knowledge? I agree.\nModc: &gt;True, but the statement does seem to indicate that he's not motivated.\n\nIn what way?\n\n&gt;So, you're saying that people are motivated by things other than moral knowledge? I agree.\n\nSo the guy is motivated to do what's moral, what's the challenge to internalism?\nSon_of_Sophroniscus: &gt;In what way?\n\nIn that he states that he's not going to stop eating meat.\n\n&gt;So the guy is motivated to do what's moral, what's the challenge to internalism?\n\nBecause for internalism the motivation has to *come from the moral judgment alone*. You could believe that donating tuna is moral, yet not be motivated to donate tuna until someone puts a gun to your head. Here the motivation would not come from any moral judgment about donating tuna.\nModc: &gt;In that he states that he's not going to stop eating meat.\n\nThis is indicative of a lack of motivation how?\n\n&gt;Because for internalism the motivation has to come from the moral judgment alone.\n\nHis motivation to not eat meat comes from his attitude towards animals, which in turn comes from moral considerations, does this not count as internalism?\n\n&gt;You could believe that donating tuna is moral, yet not be motivated to donate tuna until someone puts a gun to your head. Here the motivation would not come from any moral judgment about donating tuna.\n\nRight, and the internalist denies that this could happen.\nSon_of_Sophroniscus: &gt;This is indicative of a lack of motivation how?\n\nWhen someone says that he is not motivated by X, I take this as an indication that he is not motivated by X. Yes, he could be lying or mistaken, but I'm charitable until I have good reason not to be.\n\n&gt;His motivation to not eat meat comes from his attitude towards animals, which in turn comes from moral considerations, does this not count as internalism?\n\nSo do you or do you not think that his loving animals is evidence of a moral judgment? At first it seemed you did, then you said it was an emotion, now you're saying that it comes from moral considerations.\n\n&gt;Right, and the internalist denies that this could happen.\n\nThat's fine. I was providing a Externalist scenario where someone is motivated to act morally but not because of any moral judgment.\n\n\nModc: &gt;When someone says that he is not motivated by X, I take this as an indication that he is not motivated by X. Yes, he could be lying or mistaken, but I'm charitable until I have good reason not to be.\n\nBut the quote you've quoted doesn't say that he isn't motivated by X, so your taking his quote as an indication that he is not motivated by X seems rather strange.\n\n&gt;So do you or do you not think that his loving animals is evidence of a moral judgment? At first it seemed you did, then you said it was an emotion, now you're saying that it comes from moral considerations.\n\nI think it is the result of a moral judgement, not a moral judgement itself.\n\n&gt;That's fine. I was providing a Externalist scenario where someone is motivated to act morally but not because of any moral judgment.\n\nYea, but just outlining an externalist scenario doesn't help externalism all that much.\n\nIn your scenario, the internalist would either just deny that there was no prior motivation, perhaps saying that there wasn't enough, or deny that the tuna holder was \"making real evaluative judgments.\"\nSon_of_Sophroniscus: &gt;But the quote you've quoted doesn't say that he isn't motivated by X, so your taking his quote as an indication that he is not motivated by X seems rather strange.\n\nYour right. I didn't phrase that right. It should say, \"When someone says that he isn't going to do X, I take this as an indication that he is not motivated to do X.\"\n\n&gt;I think it is the result of a moral judgement, not a moral judgement itself.\n\nOkay.\n\n&gt;or deny that the tuna holder was \"making real evaluative judgments.\"\n\nOn what grounds? Because they failed to motivate?\nModc: &gt;Your right. I didn't phrase that right. It should say, \"When someone says that he isn't going to do X, I take this as an indication that he is not motivated to do X.\"\n\nWhy?\n\n&gt;On what grounds? Because they failed to motivate?\n\nBecause \"There\u2019s a big difference between being able to point out which things are right and wrong and actually feeling that these things are right or wrong.\"\nSon_of_Sophroniscus: &gt; Why?\n\nBecause when motivated to do X, one does not normally say \"I'm not going to do X\" when one's doing X is not hindered or prohibited by other forces.\n\n&gt;Because \"There\u2019s a big difference between being able to point out which things are right and wrong and actually feeling that these things are right or wrong.\"\n\nThat doesn't answer the question *why* one would assume that the tuna holder wasn't making real evaluative judgments.\nmehakw: If I may put my two cents in; could we not assume that if someone says \"I'm not going to do X\" it could be due to the fact that he or she may suffer from some psychological and physical attachment to the practice or object. An example would be smoking (a physical attachment due to the effects of nicotine), my one close friend has tried a countless number of times to quit (he can get beyond the \"3 day period theory\") but after a while always goes back. I know there is medical treatment and therapy to help, but the results are not guaranteed even with the MOTIVATION to do so. Now I believe an 'addiction to meat' is one of psychological attachment. The person may know it is immoral to eat meat from factory farming but because of his or her psychological attachment it is difficult for him to do so (and might even be impossible). Yes it is possible to rid of an addiction, with the proper motivation but it is different from person to person. So saying \"I'm not going to do X\" could be because of an addiction of some sort that prevents he or she OR \"because I am not motivated to do X\".\n", "prompt": "ReallyNicole: [Weekly Discussion] Is there a necessary connection between moral judgment and motivation?

Bill Gates increases his worth by $11B a year and can buy basically anything he wants.  If you taxed him at 99% he would still make $110M a year and STILL buy basically anything he wants.\ngreyspot00: Wow, that is evil. You have something, therefore you owe me! \nZellNorth: Do you think it\u2019s ok 26 people have more money than 3 billion people combined?\nLiberty_Call: Do you think it is ok to make decisions like this based on headlines without looking into what those people did to create that wealth and how the money is tied up?\n\nIf people were not allowed to be worth a whole lot we would not have things like Amazon, Microsoft, SpaceX or Apple. \n\nDo you think it is ok to dismantle these companies just to pay these ridiculous demands from people that obviously don't understand what they are demanding?\nZellNorth: No you didn\u2019t. You asked me followup questions without answering mine. \nLiberty_Call: Ok. Then let me be more clear.\n\nYour question is too vague and loaded to be answered without the extra information  I asked for. This is a complex situation, not voting for American idol.\n\nSo do you care to answer the questions? \nZellNorth: No. I do not. I don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s that difficult of a question to answer and don\u2019t see the relevance your questions. You\u2019re asking questions to change the topic to something that\u2019s more in line with whatever opinion you hold. \nLiberty_Call: So don't act like you want to have a conversation if all you want to do is spout catch phases and headlines.\n\nPromoting ignorance is never a positive way to use your life.\n\nThese questions matter because stoking those richest people from being rich would require them liquidating their assets which means selling off the huge amount of stock their own in their respective companies.\n\nNow the market is flooded with this stock. Who is going to buy it? The price will drop precipitously. Now the company can't afford to keep running and we have just caused major damage to some of the largest companies that the world relies on.\n\nHow is that helpful?\n\nThis is why it is not a simple Yes or no question. There is more going on that can be answered from pledge gleaned solely from headlines.\n\nStop promoting ignorance.\nZellNorth: I wanted the person I responded to to answer the question. Whether the information in the question is accurate or not is actually also irrelevant. I made no claims to be presenting facts or statistic. \nLiberty_Call: So why are you refusing to answer questions? Let's try a simple one.\n\nDo you think it is appropriate to destroy some of the largest and most important companies in the world right Now in the name of changing the statistic you are asking people about?\nZellNorth: I\u2019m refusing to answer irrelevant questions. I\u2019m not talking about a statistic. I used a relevant headline to ask a question. My question is philosophical not political. You\u2019re asking me political questions. \nLiberty_Call: Why are you refusing to think past the surface level here? There is little value in talking about something without trying to understand it.\n\nPhilisophically, it is important to take into account what it actually means that so few people have that much money, and what it would look like if that were not allowed to happened.\n\nIn the end with the billionaires be fine? Oh yeah.\n\nBut the workers losing their jobs, ther economy, technological development, and quality of life would all suffer in the process.\n\nSo to answer your question, in today's world it is better to have those few rich people because of what it would mean to undo that.\nZellNorth: You\u2019re in so many logical fallacies right now that it\u2019s actually impressive. Slippery Slope, Strawman, Hasty Generalizations, Ad Hominem. All that to still not answer my question. Unless I\u2019m supposed to assume your answer is \u201cyes\u201d. You\u2019re adding your own stipulations and answering questions I didn\u2019t ask. \nLiberty_Call: Instead of just listing a bunch of stuff off, why don't you point out how I am actually making those falacies?\n\nThe reality is that taking that moeny from those people would not happen in a vacuum. Their companies would be carved up, people would los4e their jobs, and things would be worse than they are now.\n\nIf you disagree, feel free to explain why, but don't just stick your fingers in your ears and refuse to participate because everyone is not tripping over themselves to agree with your view point.\n\nNow, do you actually care about the question you asked, or was this just a cry for attention?\nZellNorth: You don\u2019t even know what my view point is cause you never answered my question...\nLiberty_Call: I have answered your question multiple times now if you would pay attention, but if you need it simplified even more...\n\nGiven the current state of the world, that break down of wealth mentioned is fine.\n\nNow, did you actually care about the question, or was this just a cry for attention?\nZellNorth: Again, you\u2019re answering your own question not mine. No this isn\u2019t a cry for attention but I\u2019m not interested in your opinion on politics. I\u2019ll ask it again, maybe you forgot. It\u2019s a simple yes or no question. \n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s ok for 26 people to have more money than 3 billion people combined\u201d\nLiberty_Call: Then my answer is yes as I have stated multiple times.\n\nIf I explain my answer you think that means I no longer answered the question?\n\nWhy am I not allowed to explain my answer?\nZellNorth: You\u2019re allowed to do whatever you want lol. The issue isn\u2019t that you\u2019re explaining your answer, it\u2019s that you\u2019re answering questions I didn\u2019t ask to lead to a conclusion I possibly wasn\u2019t heading towards. \n\nSo you don\u2019t believe wealth is better off spread out among the population? \nLiberty_Call: I can't answer that without knowing what the mechanism would be for redistribution. A more fair distribution would obviously be prefered, but this is the real world we are talking about, not a pipedream, and thus my opinions will reflect reality.\n\nEquality of opportunity is crucial to ensure that everyone has a fair shot at achieving their dreams. \n\nEquality of outcome starts to become more evil because you are not allowing people to benefit fully from their own labor and risk, while people that are not contributing their fair share end up with a free ride that just hurts the rest of society.\n\nSo through which mechanism would the redistribution be enforced?\nZellNorth: Who said anything about redistribution? Again, you\u2019re thinking too much. My question is ethical, not political. If given the choice between evenly distributed wealth or a few having the majority of the world\u2019s currency, which would you choose?\nLiberty_Call: You are trying to ask a pointless question then. If we do not take into account the reality of the world around us, you are just making noise.\n\nTo go from the situation we have no to one that has a more equal distribution will require some sort of action, no?\nZellNorth: Yes and I\u2019m getting there but we have to ask the ethical question first. If there is no ethical dilemma there doesn\u2019t need to be any action taken. So if you think there is no reason to be alarmed by .000000005% of the population having a majority of the wealth there is no reason to even have a conversation. \n\nThe guy I responded to seemed to think there was some sort of villainification of the wealthy. \nLiberty_Call: &gt;So if you think there is no reason to be alarmed by .000000005% of the population having a majority of the wealth there is no reason to even have a conversation. \n\nI never said I was not alarmed.\n\nWhy are you making things up and attributing them to me?\nZellNorth: I said \u201cif\u201d. I\u2019m asking questions to find where you stand. I don\u2019t know what questions to ask you cause you spend so many responses not answering my question (:\nLiberty_Call: You dont know what questions to ask because you refuse to read what I am writing and take it into account.\n\nYou are demanding that I pretend this is not happening in the real world, which is ridiculous and pointless.\n\nRead what my responses are saying instead of just discounting them out of hand.\n\nYou have also not explained why you are making stuff up and claiming I am stating it. Why are you acting in such bad faith?\nZellNorth: That\u2019ll lead to having two different conversations. I refuse to answer your questions cause they are irrelevant to what I\u2019m asking. I don\u2019t know what to ask you cause you kept trying to change the subject. \nLiberty_Call: So you resort to making stuff up and pretending I said it?\n\nWhy?\nZellNorth: I didn\u2019t make anything up. Go reread what I said. \nLiberty_Call: So if that was really just a question and not accusatory, how were you supposed to figure that out without letting me explain my reasoning for my opinion?\n\nThis still sounds like you just wanted people to agree with you and won't engage with anyone that is not just blindly agreeing.\nZellNorth: My goal in any discussion is to find the common ground. I\u2019m not here to debate. The us vs them mentality that exists in this current climate has made people forget how to have a discussion. For instance, in this conversation I was trying to find the thing we can both agree with, \u201cspreading the wealth is fundamentally morally good\u201d. That\u2019s the thing I thought we could all agree on. If that\u2019s the case the discussion can then become, how do we achieve that. We would have gotten to redistribution of wealth eventually and then maybe a debate could ensue. But if we have no common ground to stand on, it\u2019s not even a debate, thats an argument. \n\nYour first initial response to me was instantly to create a wall. You defended your point when I didn\u2019t even attack it. I would actually tend to agree with you, but you weren\u2019t interested in a conversation you were interested in being right. Maybe you thought you could prove your point so well I would concede you to be the better man, I don\u2019t know. \n\nThe man in the original article we are commenting on sees the value in redistribution of wealth and I\u2019d love to see more of that. How can we come to a conclusion that sees money spread out among more of the population. We can only figure that when we all decide that it\u2019s the right thing to do. \nLiberty_Call: Then you should really approach the situation in a more open minded way rather than the us (the poor) vs them (the rich) way you have been.\n\n&gt; I was trying to find the thing we can both agree with, \u201cspreading the wealth is fundamentally morally good\u201d.\n\nThis depends on quite a bit. I firmly believe in and follow the mantra, \"From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.\n\nThat means if someone is not performing and contributing to society to the best of their ability, it is actually harmful to redistributed wealth to those folks.\n\nIt is not as simple as just ensuring equality of outcome because that is bad for the people that contrubute.\n\nWhen u started talki.g about what the redistribution of wealth would look like you refused to talk about it.\n\nStop trying to over simplify complex situations. It does not do any good and only fosters ignorance.\n\nNow that you have admitted that redistribution was what you were driving towards this whole time, what will that look like? How do you redistribute wealth that is tied up in assets that are need to keep the economy running and people working?\nZellNorth: I was never given a chance to be open minded cause you kept changing the subject. I was attempting to keep the conversation on topic. \n\nRedistribution like what the gentleman in the article did is a good start. I\u2019m over this conversation though. Took way too long to get here and my attention is gone. \nLiberty_Call: You need to ask questions that can be answered by people that understand what is going on.\n\nIf you really cared about this topic you would not be asking yes or no questions and getting upset when people try to get more info or answer them appropriately.\n\nStop pretending to care then getting upset when someone is informed enough to realize your questions are silly and unanswerable in good faith.\nZellNorth: lol ok\n", "prompt": "speckz: Aldi introduces wages higher than the \u2018real living wage\u2019 after supermarket has record year\n\nraliberti2:..and they maintain reasonable prices on their products so people can actually afford to eat well\ngiuseppe443: and the owner of aldi s\u00fcd was until his death in", "orig": "2014 the richest man in germany \nTrumpImpeachedAugust: That's an aspect of wealth inequality that *really* pisses me off.

Here is the thing. Documentaries don\u2019t necessarily have to tell the absolute truth. What comes to your mind when you think of a documentary? Those soothing calm videos of Nat Geo or Discovery? Well, ya those are documentaries too but just because they show  99% truth, doesn\u2019t mean there exists documentaries that show just 25% truth.\n\nI first realised this when I attended a lecture by a director who made very famous documentaries (forgot his name) and this was what he first told the class before he started his lecture. Here are some interesting points he said that stuck with me:\n\n1. Documentaries are planned and scripted just like movies are. They have a start, and end and various acts.\n2. Documentaries have protagonists and antagonists. A very skilled director can make even a criminal look like a protagonist.\n3. Documentaries are like watching Ghost Adventures. You record hours of nothing just in the hopes of getting a minute of juicy cow. And when you get the cow, you milk it till it\u2019s dry. The cameras are always rolling.\n4. Sometimes even when nothing happened, you can edit it out to something.\n\nDocumentaries are very much like Wikipedia. If you use Wikipedia articles as reference in your project report, your report would get thrown out the window. \n\nYou should know this because in case in future you ever come across a documentary, take it with a grain of salt. Don\u2019t use that documentary as facts to strengthen your argument. Don\u2019t get riled up watching a documentary. You might be only learning partial truth. Directors of documentaries don\u2019t get paid a lot unless they have a very good portfolio. So most of them are inclined to show you partial truths.\nDale4052: So who did they try to make look holy? Almost everyone was a piece of shit in that doc, except for the lady that got her hand bitten off and some of the other workers. Sure they had drug problems but drug addicts can still be good people unlike killer Carole and exotic joe.\nUltimaGabe: Maybe not \"holy\", but Joe was very much the protagonist, and Carol was very much the antagonist. Everyone in a story can be bad and still be a part of a constructed narrative.\nDale4052: &gt;Maybe not \"holy\", but Joe was very much the protagonist,\n\nWhat??? They made him look like a complete fool who took advantage of drug addicts and mistreated animal's.  What documentary did you watch?\nUltimaGabe: Apparently the one with a dictionary attached with the page open to the word \"protagonist\".\nDale4052: Being the protagonist of the documentary just makes him the main focus, not good or holy jackass.\nUltimaGabe: Did you even read my post? That's exactly what I said.\nDale4052: Then wtf does your post have to do with my question for op if you werent trying to say joe was the good guy or the better of the 2?\nUltimaGabe: I said that he wasn't portrayed as \"holy\", but he was the protagonist. Whether or not he is better, he was the main focus. So many episodes are set up for you to be rooting for him, even though he is arguably the biggest scumbag of them all.\nDale4052: &gt;So many episodes are set up for you to be rooting for him, \n\nAgain documentary did you watch, they clowned him and constantly pointed out how much of a scumbag he is.\nUltimaGabe: Did you skip the first three episodes or something?\nDale4052: Nope I'm pretty sure it was in the first episode that they layed out the entire direction of the documentary when Joe's producer saying something along the lines of everyone that keeps big cats is a piece of shit.\nUltimaGabe: So if a book says something bad about its protagonist in the first chapter, then that makes them not the protagonist anymore? It sounds like the documentary was just more complex than \"this good guy, that bad guy\". You're downplaying basically any amount of technique that went into the storytelling.\nDale4052: Again, being the protagonist does not mean the character will be depicted as good or should be rooted for, it just means he/she is the main focus.\n\n&gt;You're downplaying basically any amount of technique that went into the storytelling.\n\nSeems more like your one of the simpletons that was swayed by Joe's charisma into rooting for him at times. Just because you found him comical or entertaining does not change the fact that the film was constantly shitting on him.\nUltimaGabe: &gt; Just because you found him comical or entertaining does not change the fact that the film was constantly shitting on him.\n\nIt sounds like you're incapable of recognizing story structure because of the traits of the characters. You also keep contradicting yourself; is he the protagonist or isn't he? All I said was that he was, and you keep trying to prove me wrong despite using that word to describe him yourself.\nDale4052: When did I say he wasnt the protagonist?\n\n&gt;It sounds like you're incapable of recognizing story structure because of the traits of the characters.\n\nSounds like your incapable of understanding that the show was shitting on everyone involved except for the workers. \n\n&gt;All I said was that he was, and you keep trying to prove me wrong despite using that word to describe him yourself.\n\nWith reading comprehension skills as terrible as yours I understand why the doc has you so confused. I have never said he isnt the protagonist, I said being the protagonist only means he is the main focus. Learn how to read.\nUltimaGabe: &gt; When did I say he wasnt the protagonist?\n\nDafuq? You're trolling me at this point. How about [this post right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/g0qovs/ysk_that_documentary_are_not_absolute_truths/fncdx0l/) where I said he was the protagonist and you asked me, and I quote, \"What documentary did you watch?\"\nDale4052: Yep because you were responding to my question for op, asking who in the serious was made to look holy jackass. I still never said he wasnt the protagonist, you answering my question for op means that you did feel there is ways that they tried to make him look good. That's why my reply was what documentary didnyou watch. Seriously go get a tutor to work on your reading comprehension skills, when you're done with that go rewatch tiger king so you can understand what the film is actually telling you.\nUltimaGabe: &gt; I never said he wasn't the protagonist, except when I did, learn to read\n\nYikes. I hope whatever you're going through, you come out on the other end.

I have a very sensitive nose and I know when I\u2019m not smelling good. It could be however a volume issue but that only explains the interruption and not the general act of indifference regarding me. Even when I talk one on one with someone it\u2019s mostly me who initiates the conversation and the other party doesn\u2019t make any effort for it to continue. It feels like I\u2019m just bothering them, and it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t want to talk they just don\u2019t wanna talk to me but are perfectly responsive when it\u2019s with some one else.\n\nThis has been my experience ever since childhood and I don\u2019t know why.

If you die on 8-4 it will start you on 8-1. Still cool though.\nTheKunit: Seems like Nintendo intentionally made the switch version include something like this. I can't imagine it was accidental. When you load your profile it only takes you to the last caslte you beat. Meaning if you beat 5 levels and got to all castle but can't beat it, you go back to the previous castle when you load the game. It's meant a lot of redoing levels and it went from the wii version being my families favorite game to the switch version not being used at all.\nfatphotog: The switch nes app has save states, you can literally save at any moment no matter where you are. You start exactly at that moment when you go back. Are you not using the save state function?\nTheKunit: It's not super Mario Brothers nes it's super Mario Brothers deluxe for the switch.\n\nAlso how do I get the nes version? I have only had my switch for a short time. Didn't even know you could get old games like that.\nfatphotog: Oh you mean new super Mario bro\u2019s delux, my bad. You can still quick save where you are on the map in that game. I forget the exact process but I think you just pause and choose quick save. It will make you quit back to the menu but will have a little balloon next to your save file meaning it\u2019s been quick saved and you\u2019ll start right from the point of the map where you quick saved. The original nes version is part of the online subscription that you can pay for. It allows you to have online access in supported games and also comes with a nes channel and a SNES channel. They each have many games from each console you can play anytime as long as you are subbed to Nintendo online. I think it\u2019s like $3 dollars a month or something.\nTheKunit: Unfortunately the quick save function either only works once or has some other odd requirement that it does not tell you about. At this point I've done the beginning of the game up to the second works at least 3 or 4 times and so far it's still forcing me to restart from the world 1 castle. I quick wave every time. Doing some research you are supposed to go back and beat an easy castle so it fully saves the game. I don't know why a basic save function is so difficult for Nintendo to figure out but it's infuriating. Super Mario party is the same way. You can't save in the game at all. If you quit during a game it's gone for good.\nfatphotog: When you\u2019re done playing, if you have gone a couple levels since the last castle or mushroom house, just quick save..Next time you want to play you start where you quick saved.\nTheKunit: OK but I've done that. If you have to play multiple sessions between castles it won't save more than the one time.\nfatphotog: I don\u2019t understand, just quick save again?\n\n*edit  Do you mean once you restart from a quick save you lose all your lives before beating a castle or finding a mushroom house? Yes if you lose all your lives after starting from a quick save, you will start at your last *real* save point. It\u2019s very, very difficult in this game to actually lose all your lives imo.\nTheKunit: https://www.gamepur.com/guides/nsmbu-deluxe-how-to-save\n\nThis is a good descriptor of the issue\nfatphotog: Right, and that article clearly states that if you don\u2019t quick save again, which is all you\u2019ll have to do, you go back to your last \u201creal\u201d save. Which is exactly what I said.\nTheKunit: Basically if you turn off the switch or put in another game the quick save function doesn't work\nfatphotog: Yes, so don\u2019t do that? The article is literally saying exactly what I\u2019m saying. This is how the very short article ends: \u201cOnce you reload the save file where the Quick Save occurred, you\u2019ll need to keep quick saving to keep your progress indefinitely before you reach an actual save point.\n\nIf you turn the system off or close the game without Quick Sav, you\u2019ll be sent back to the previous actual save you did\u2014which means you could lose tons of progress that you made through difficult levels.\u201d\nTheKunit: Dude I'm telling you it's not without quick saving like you are trying to make out. You seem hell bent on proving that an internet stranger doesn't understand how to save a freaking video game though so idk what to tell you. It's not like I've been playing video games for my entire life and know how to do basic shit like saving, pressing the menu button, or jumping.\n\nI also need help getting my undies on after my nurse assisted shower.\n\nGood riddance\nfatphotog: Holy shit bro, I\u2019m not being rude at all. I\u2019m just answering your questions. The article you posted says literally the exact same thing that I am saying. Just don\u2019t turn the game off or put in another game without quick saving first. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know what else to say. I mean it\u2019s not hard at all to understand, so now I am going to be condescending, because you are clearly stupid. JUST QUICK SAVE BEFORE YOU STOP PLAYING AND YOU WILL START AT THE SAME LEVEL YOU WERE ON!!!!!! HOLY FUCK, SORRY FOR PATIENTLY TRYING TO EXPLAIN THIS VERY BASIC CONCEPT TO YOU.

Also Republican White Houses and legislative majorities had larger deficits than Democrats.

It is absolutely laughable to think that Democrats are the financially responsible party. \nWhat civil rights are under threat? You just parrot leftist dribble. The Democrat party has shown to be the actual tyrants during the lockdown if you didn't notice then you never will because as I initially stated you are a product of a communist style brain washing and as the video stated you will only see it when you get a boot on your throat.\nThrowaway1990811: [The stats say otherwise.](https://amarkfoundation.org/us-federal-deficits/) Feel free to counter with numbers rather than whitewashing history and being emotional.\n\nRoe v Wade is a prime example.

It\u2019s a second deadbolt that only has the indoor handle with no external key.\njojofroyo: That\u2019s interesting. I wonder the story behind a law like that. I\u2019ve never even heard of a tenant lock! To the googles!\nFeynt: In quite a few places there are stories of the landlord coming into apartments during the day and looking around.  The only recourse is court, for the purposes of privacy, but it is technically their property to look through unless the rental agreement says otherwise.  My mom had that happen once when she was pregnant with me in Montreal.  The tenant lock is meant to be an agreement that while you're home, you aren't supposed to be worrying about someone coming into your apartment unannounced.  That doesn't help for the *other* times when you're *not* home...\ncflatjazz: I negotiated a 24 hour notice period with my TX landlord for this very reason. It's his property, yes, but I preferred some notice before having someone come muck about in the middle of my things. So he just gives me heads up if he needs to come by for his biannual maintenance. It's suited us very well so far, and IIRC the language provides an exception for emergency maintenance (fire, broken pipes while we're on vacation, etc). \n\nI'm not sure how fast it would hold in a court, but was worth the knowledge that he could be reasonable and compromise up front.\ngianni_: Unlike the person you replied to, legally in Ontario, Canada, landlords have to give written notice, I believe of 24 hours, that they will be entering an apartment\nkevin_the_dolphoodle: Same in California unless it\u2019s an emergency. California has extremely strong tenant rights though\nFunWithOnions: Thank god.  With how expensive it is to live here, we need renters protection against greedy landlords.\nkevin_the_dolphoodle: It\u2019s definitely good to have these protections. I own a home that I used to rent out. I gave the tenants 120 days notice to move out. I was legally obliged to give them 60, but I wanted to give them as much time as possible to find a new living situation. In the end I had to evict them and they totally took advantage of me. I do not have much extra money, and they decided to try and financially ruin me for \u201ckicking them out of their home\u201d. It can be a double edged sword for sure\naethelmund: I've read one of the better ways of dealing with this kind of thing is paying them to get the fuck out of your property, usually they take the cash rather that living for a couple months rent free\nkevin_the_dolphoodle: I know that kind of thing happens in San Francisco all the time. My brother, who was already planning on leaving, offered to leave for 50k. They offered 25k. My brother moved the same time he was planning on moving with 25k. For clarification, he was renting a rent-controlled place in the mission in SF. He had been there for 15 years and was paying 25-30% what it could have been bringing in\naethelmund: Like he wasn't paying rent and refused to leave? That's kinda shitty if that's the case\nZippyTheRobin: Comment you replied to described a \"rent controlled\" apartment, meaning the landlord can only raise the rent on a tenant at a specified, regulated rate (to prevent residents being forced out of their homes by rising rents in hypercompetitive markets such as the SF bay area). The commenter's brother offered to leave the apartment (giving up his legally given rent controlled status in exchange for the landlord buying him out) so the landlord could rent it out at current market rates.\naethelmund: AH that makes more sense now, I get it.

{"full_text": "computersaidno: Frustrated and disheartened with pullups (CC step 3) - what to do\nI started following Convict conditioning's pullup progression about a year ago. Before starting I was able to get 3-4 good deadheang pullups. The first step was stupidly easy. The second step was not! Spent a lot of time there. \nI've been on the third step for over five months and it feels like I'm wasting time and maybe even regressing on the whole. \nThis step feels like kneeling pushups in that it doesn't really contain any core movement of the exercise I'm trying to develop. The next step does, and I attempted half pullups for the first time earlier and could hardly manage 4 reps. Weak! Was having trouble getting chin to bar. Also it focuses on the upper half of the pull, sort of makes more sense to start with the bottom half no?\n\nI don't know, I don't know how to proceed now but I really want to get on with pullups! I feel like I'd struggle to get a single deadhang pullup right now. Means I've gone backwards in a year. I know CC is meant to be helping with base strength and all at first but... does this make sense? I think if I wasn't doing grip training deadhangs I wouldn't even be able to hang off a bar. \n\nWould appreciate advice. Either put my head down and continue building reps with CC step  (I'm currently up to about 19 on the first set, 12 on the second. At my current rate I'd estimate I'll take another 4-5 months to reach progression standard) or move to a better more useful progression - if so what?\nhybridchildren: Hey, don't be disheartened, man! I've spent over 1 year stuck on some exercise then suddenly progress super fast once I discovered the weakness in my training. I'm confident you can do it too.\n\nSo let me get this straight; you could do 3-4 full pull ups before doing CC? If so, why not start at level 5 instead of level 2? I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding you.\n\nAnyway, like m092 says, my suggestion is to practice negatives to build up strength to reach full pull ups. I don't know how dedicated you are to CC, but I also suggest you abandon it (AT LEAST for pull ups; you can work on the other big 6 if you like) in favor of a different progression method. Depending on your goals, I think you can achieve full PU and OAPU following a simpler path. \n\nSo here's what I'd do if I were you. \n\n#1 do (or build up to) 3x5 sets of FULL, slow negatives for your PU training. No more jack knife pulls. \n\n#2 I don't know the rest of your workout, but if this is an important goal, put the negatives in the beginning of the workout. \n\n#3 Once you are more confident with your negatives, give PUs a shot again. If you can do 1 set of 3 reps, I'd say thats enough to move on from negatives and start training PUs themselves. Work up to 3x5 again.\n\n#4 If you have spare weight in the form of fat, focus on losing some of it through healthier/reduced eating. This will not only help your PUs but all other BW exercises. DO NOT amputate a leg or two for quick gainz.\n\n#5 report back in 2 weeks with progress, no matter how small or big. \n\ncomputersaidno: I'll try this. \nmyp123: Errr, still waiting on that report.\n", "prompt": "computersaidno: Frustrated and disheartened with pullups (CC step 3) - what to do\nI started following Convict conditioning's pullup progression about a year ago.

{"full_text": "datingnoob-plshelp: Feeling like I can\u2019t talk to or rely on anyone when I feel like crap. Anyone feel like that?\nI feel like I have a hard time connecting to people. Past few years I\u2019ve had times where I was having hard time coping with different things and relationships and I feel like there is NO one I can turn to (hence I\u2019m turning to strangers on Reddit). I feel like I can\u2019t reveal how I actually feel because 1) no one has the time to listen to me rant, 2) I sound pathetic and lame, 3) people honestly don\u2019t care much about me. Unfortunately for me, I\u2019m the type that have a hard time dealing with things internally. My thoughts go in circles, I over analyze, I ruminate and obsess. Only way out is to talk to people. Because of how I feel, I feel like I have no real friends. And that lead me to think wtf is wrong with me??\n\nI\u2019ve tried therapy. Can\u2019t find a good one. Just a waste of time and money telling my stories over and over again to no avail.\n\nAnyone else feel like this (so I don\u2019t feel so weird and alone)? How do you cope or get out of this rut?\nAlytia: I completely sympathize and I think I can help solve your problem. I was the same way - obsessing about things and going around and around in circles in my head until I thought I was going to go insane. I used to dump it all on friends... which made me lose them. It's bloody hard work being someone's emotional crutch and I don't blame them in the least for not being able to handle it. \n\nThe way I broke the cycle in my head was to write it all down in a journal. This has multiple benefits:\n\n1). By dumping my problems on paper instead of using my friends up, I relieved the burden I was placing on other people.\n\n2). I found it easier to identify the circles I was making in my head. I'd scan back up the page and be like, okay, I'd already made that point earlier and I have nothing new to add to it - I need to move onto something new that's bothering me.\n\n3). I could come back to what I'd written the next day with a fresh set of eyes. Often I'd find that whatever was bothering me was... like you say, lame and pathetic. I'd be really grateful that I didn't tell someone else what I'd been thinking. Or if it wasn't, I could better identify solutions or strategies for my problem. I didn't need a friend to tell me what to do, I just needed some space to think about it.\n\n4). Over time you can track trends in the way that you've been thinking. I look back at my earliest entries and am amazed at how far I've come. It's actually pretty great.\n\nThe way I do it is set aside some time every day for journaling. If pesky thoughts arise during the day, I say 'okay I hear you, but now's not the time for this - save it for later.' Sometimes I sit down to write and find that I can't even remember what was bothering me so much in the first place.\n\nHope this helps you just as much as it's helped me.\ndatingnoob-plshelp: Thank you. I have tried journaling (still am). In fact I journal in 3 different places depending where I am. I also jog down nagging thoughts throughout the day (I can\u2019t push things out of my mind), but doesn\u2019t seems to help. I feel like I need a sounding board to bounce off information and to discuss with. But maybe i need to repeatedly go back to what I put down. \nAlytia: You're welcome! It's great that you're trying things - lots of people complain about their situation but refuse to do anything about it. Perhaps you just need to change your approach a little? Here's something which helps me: I'm okay with pouring all of my angst and misery onto the page, but I also always try and end each entry with a solution.\n\nThen I usually start the next entry with a review of how the previous day went. Did my solution work? Or do I need to try a different approach? Or maybe I forgot to try it, so I'll have to do it again tomorrow. I try and be kind to myself about this - I use humour if I'm being reproachful.\n\nI also tend to talk to myself in the second person, which might sound a bit weird. But it helps me feel like I'm taking an outside perspective on what's happening inside my head. I ask myself questions, like *'Why do you react this way?'* or make observations, like *'You always assume that people don't like you. But there could be a million reasons why you might experience perceived dislike or neglect, and most of them have nothing to do with you. Dwelling on howother people feel about you is silly.'*\n\nSecond. It's helpful to be skeptical about just how important your thoughts and anxieties are. I know that mine often seem incredibly big when I'm having them, but once I gain some perspective, they become inconsequential. It becomes easy to sort out what really matters, and then to let the confusing extra bits fly away.\n\nFinally... I think that you've got two separate issues: 1) over-analysing your thoughts, which keep turning in circles in your head, and 2) feeling alone and/or lonely. The problem is, if your solution to 1) is to dump your negative feelings and thoughts on other people to help clear your head, you'll find it very difficult to fix problem 2) because it's very hard to be close friends with someone who cannot contain themselves emotionally.\n\nIf you can go some way to becoming more emotionally independent and to rely on yourself to generate solutions, then you'll be a better friend. Less self-absorbed... more aware of others.\n\nBest of luck!\ndatingnoob-plshelp: I think your approach is really good. Think all I was doing was verbal dump everything out but didn\u2019t really think about how to use that information to help myself. \n\nI talk to myself too! I have two google accts sometimes I talk to myself from a second person perspective and that kinda helps.\n\nI feel like I am mindful to not be self absorbed. But you\u2019re right, if I\u2019m so emotionally preoccupied with my thoughts and feelings there\u2019s no way it doesn\u2019t seep out into my relationship with others.\n\nThanks again!

What I got was this [amazing package](https://imgur.com/a/N0gjaXL)\nA ziploc bag with a charger and \u00e0 c\u00e2ble inside. I tried charging with it and it was way slower than my previous charger, an obvious scam. I'm also kind of parano\u00efd about counterfeit charger as I'm scared they might be a fire hazard so I immediately contacted Amazon support for a refund. \n\nIt's really weird tho because I bought it again from the same URL, and I got an official charger with the normal packaging and stuff. In terms of trust from the customer this is really backwards, \u00e0 seller has to build hundreds or even thousands of reviews for their products to be visible and trusted, and \u00e0 single counterfeit manufacturer can easily slip in and take advantage of that visibility for free, it's really dumb. \n\nThe brands surely should be against this as it can severely damage the image of their products if you see \"ORIGINAL Insert brand ITEM\", paying full price and you think you got shafted by the brand in the end.\nfazalmajid: Amazon has the gall to turn their own lack of diligence in policing their market into a profit center, and making the brands pay to weed out counterfeits from their store:\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18244603/amazon-project-zero-counterfeit-listing-remove-products\n\nRead this article for the Kafkaesque nature of Amazon's processes for honest sellers who have been tarred by association with counterfeit goods due to commingling:\n\nhttps://blog.dshr.org/2019/04/what-is-amazon.html\n\nand this one explains why Amazon is rife with counterfeits (Apple says *90% of its accessories sold on Amazon are fakes*):\n\nhttps://www.elevationlab.com/blogs/news/amazon-is-complicit-with-counterfeit-sellers\nfarahad: Makes sense.  People pay a premium for real products, and if a high enough percentage of buyers keep their knockoffs because they don't know any better, that's added profit.  That's great for the unethical sellers, but I don't see Amazon's angle.  If Amazon's collecting the same fees for the knockoffs, their only advantage is...cheaper shipping / logistics, because the knockoff suppliers are potentially closer to some customers?  If that's the case, they're being *very* shortsighted, because this is the kind of thing that will result in their losing repeat customers and product share.  Once they get the reputation of selling cheap knockoffs, people will start looking elsewhere.  Same thing happened to eBay and most other unvetted forums.  People don't want to have to scrutinize their purchases.\nfazalmajid: I agree the reputational damage outweighs the gains for them. Amazon's marketplace platform makes significantly more money than Amazon's own e-commerce operations, and AWS, Amazon's platform business, accounts for 2/3 of the value of the company (and indeed AWS' CEO Andy Jassy is Bezos' successor), so that's how they view themselves now.  Amazon prides itself on being customer-centric, but in this case the customer is the third-party seller, not the end-user, we are the product, despite spending money.\n\nI stopped buying electronics from Amazon a long time ago and only get them from B&amp;H Photo, Adorama or direct from the manufacturer. My Amazon spending has collapsed by a factor of 6x over its peak in 2011:\n\nhttps://blog.majid.info/slow-decline-of-amazon-prime/\nizzittho: As someone who works with a seller....nah, they\u2019re still much better to the customer in comparison to how they treat sellers. I reckon they only really want the pool of sellers so they can gather data on what sells and what\u2019s searched for. \n\nThey have a nice little setup where they let others take the risks first and then pounce on anything doing well and edge others out. Think about how much insight you end up getting if you\u2019re in their shoes - you get searches, sales figures, often literally a list of people\u2019s suppliers, if you get items taken down due to counterfeit accusations (happens all the time, but funnily enough never to real counterfeits) and need to provide their info as proof to get reinstated.\n\nThey can potentially know your costs too. They have all this valuable data they can probably sell to someone, and can use it to know exactly what to sell themselves and how to get it. The fact that they\u2019re guaranteed to have more money than you to work with and don\u2019t need to do any guesswork to determine what will sell means you\u2019re guaranteed to eventually get undercut by them if you\u2019ve enjoyed too much success. They\u2019re in competition with you using the data you provide them against you.\n\nThe trick is that even the marketplace is all about the data they can gather. Data\u2019s the name of their whole game, regardless of how they use it. The kowtowing to customers builds loyalty that they can eventually maintain without it, so they\u2019ll gradually decrease benefits, and of course pursuing dishonest sellers and fakes isn\u2019t really worth the effort to them if they can get sellers themselves to do the legwork, so they leave it up to them with little to no help.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the whole more or less stealing FBA shipments to sell on their deal site fiasco.

{"full_text": "tolos: Six months of mostly bodyweight fitness (progress post)\n###Background\n\nI found Starting Strength a few years ago and tried it a few times in the intervening period, but I never really stuck with the program. I found the routine boring, my diet was terrible, and I never made much progress.  \n\nMy stats as of late 2012 were:\n\n- male, 27  \n- Height: 6\u20322\u2033 (~1.83 m)  \n- Weight: 155 lbs (~70 kg)  \n- Squat: 165 lbs (~75 kg) @ 3 x 5  \n- Bench: 115 lbs (~52 kg) @ 3 x 5  \n- Deadlift: 165 lbs (~75 kg) @ 1 x 5  \n- Overhead Press: 80 lbs (~36 kg) @ 3 x 5  \n- Pullups: 2x8\n\nAround the end of 2012 I decided to start a simple bodyweight routine. I realized that learning bodyweight skills was much more rewarding than barbell work. I had to take some time off of fitness, but in early 2013 I found /r/bodyweightfitness. I bought a power rack and rings from amazon and some weights from craigslist and came up with a plan.\n\n-----\n\n###Routine\n\nI follow the /r/bodyweightfitness FAQ [routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq) for the most part. Vertical push, vertical pull, horizontal push, horizontal pull, legs three days a week. Every workout I try to increase reps, time, or move on to a more advanced position. Before every workout I do some [stretching](http://phraktured.net/molding-mobility.html) and some skill work (handstands, L sit). Afterwards I do one accessory or pre-hab lift followed by [isometric stretching](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0940149451) for splits. On off-days I usually do a few handstand sets. I have a bit of free time, and since I'm kind of lazy, my workouts usually take two to three hours\u2014about half that time if I push myself.  \n\nI sedulously followed my routine for three months until almost all of my exercises started stalling. I thought it was time to move on to a more advanced routine so I tried a push/pull split for a month, and I started to make a small amount of progress again. About this time I bought [Overcoming Gravity](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1467933120) and realized that I needed to program in deload weeks\u2014I had been increasing difficulty almost every workout and I had only missed two workout days since I had started four months ago. I had been pushing myself hard for a long time without breaks and didn't realize I was hurting my progress. I was also tired all the time. After taking a rest week I felt much better, using the time to make some modifications to my routine. \n\nNow I'm doing eight week cycles, ending with a rest week (seven week cycles?), then I re-evaluate and set goals for the next eight weeks. The only thing that has really changed was moving to light/heavy programming for some of my movements, but that has made a large difference. With the exception of the push/pull split month, my routine hasn't changed much. Here's what I do every workout day, three times a week (M/W/F):\n\n***Warmup***\n\n- skill work: 60s handstand balance, L sit 20s, RTO 90\u00b0 support hold 15s  \n- wrist stretches + mobility  \n- skill work: 60s handstand balance, hanging leg raise progression, RTO 90\u00b0 support hold 15s  \n- neck stretch, arm swings, shoulder dislocations, wall slides, side-to-side twist  \n- skill work: 60s handstand balance, hanging leg raise progression, RTO 90\u00b0 support hold 15s  \n- kick/leg stretch (front, side, rear)  \n- skill work: 60s handstand balance, hanging leg raise progression, RTO 90\u00b0 support hold 15s  \n- standing pike/hamstring stretch, pancake/straddle stretch  \n\n***Lift***\n\n- planche progression  \n- weighted pullup progression  \n- vertical push (OHP or HeSPU)  \n- front lever progression  \n- legs (squat or deadlift)  \n\n***Cooldown***\n\n- Accessory/prehab (choose one: bridge, deltoid row, reverse hyper extension, wrist extensor curl, shoulder mobility)\n- Isometric splits (side, front left, front right)\n\n**Notes on routine**\n\n- Pullups were the first to stall and have seen very good success with heavy/light/medium days. I read a lot about [madcow](http://stronglifts.com/madcow/index.htm) which is what I based my current pullup routine on. (Overcoming Gravity affirmed I made the right programming choice).  \n- Handstand pushups (HaSPU) have been extremely frustrating. Something about parallettes and a short ceiling make these much more challenging than headstand pushups (HeSPU) on the floor. In fact, they are so annoying I've recently decided to drop them for OHP. I do HeSPU on light days.  \n- Legs have never been a high priority for me; they are always at the end of the workout. After squats and deadlift stalled, I changed over to a compressed 5/3/1 routine: week 1 (w1) squats on Mon; w1 deadlift Wed; w2 squat Fri; w2 deadlift Mon; etc. It's worked out well so far, doing twelve \"weeks\" of 5/3/1 in eight weeks. I skipped a few times to focus on running two 5K's.  \n- I only do one core-specific exercise for a few sets. I trained L-sit for a while, but after I got a 20s hold on the floor I started working on straight leg raise, feet-to-bar. I'm following [this](http://www.dragondoor.com/articles/developing-the-hanging-leg-lift/) progression now, on straight arm L lift.   \n- Around two months ago I felt like my wrists were finally strong enough to do increased handstand work. I try to spend 30 minutes a week on my hands now, and I've made a large amount of progress since I started practicing more. Average hold time is probably 6-10s, but sometimes I get lucky.  \n- I rarely do anything on off days besides handstands.  \n\nA few things I've found that have helped me stay dedicated:  \n\n- I found /r/90daysgoal soon after I started working out and giving weekly status updates really helped me start out (I no longer post there)  \n- Working out with one or two friends  \n- Writing everything down every workout, and making progress videos every four weeks for slow-to-improve movements (planche, front lever)  \n\n-----\n\n###Progress\n\nWeight: 165\u2013170 lbs (~77 kg)\n\n| Lift | Mar 2013 | Sep 2013 |   \n|:--|:--|:--|  \n| handstand | 30s against wall | 27s free standing |  \n| headstand pushup  | negative | 3x5 wall |  \n| overhead press \u2020 | ?? | 115 lbs (~52 kg) @ 3x5 |  \n| planche (floor) | frog stand 60s | [knees behind arms/almost adv tuck 5s](http://youtu.be/JFySGbEPmbM) |  \n| bench (untrained) | 115 lbs (~52 kg) @ 3x5 | 165 lbs (~75kg) @ 1x1 |  \n| pullup | 3x5 | [bw+65 lbs (~30kg) @ 1x5](http://youtu.be/Bv_JBqO8I1k) |  \n| front lever (bar) | tuck 4x15s | [adv tuck 4x15s](http://youtu.be/ra2Ddgp_BCE) |  \n| squat | 135 lbs (~61 kg) @ 3x5 | [240 lbs (~110 kg) @ 1x2](http://youtu.be/OVmVndPZcoc) |  \n| deadlift | 135 lbs (~61 kg) @ 3x5 | [275 lbs (~125 kg) @ 1x3](http://youtu.be/xpRMrxHnR1U) |  \n| L sit | tuck (chair) 4x10s | L (floor) 1x20s |  \n| V sit (untrained) | not possible | 45\u00b0 @ 1 x 8s |  \n\n    \u2020   I just recently started training OHP, but the HeSPU work had a large amount of carryover.  \n\n| 1x failure (untrained) | Sep 2013 |   \n|:--|:--|  \n| headstand pushup | 1x9 wall |  \n| pullup | 1x14 |  \n| front lever | [straddle attempt]( http://youtu.be/gpSf2oQCSGI) |  \n\n[strstd](http://i.imgur.com/8wXem2l.png)  \n\nMy flexibility has improved a great deal. For the first time in my life I can lean forward and touch my forehead to my knees. I can almost put my palms flat on the ground with straight legs. I am perhaps six inches from front splits, and a little farther with side splits (though I'm currently recovering from over-stretching my right hip adductor). To give an idea of where I was previously, I could straddle a little more than 90\u00b0, and for my pike I could barely touch the top of my shoes on a good day.\n\nAs a side note, I have noticed increased hypertrophy even though every set is five reps or fewer. Not a large change, but enough that many people have noticed, including myself ([progress pic](http://imgur.com/SgZbVnF), [me](http://imgur.com/a/slzDK)). My abs are finally beginning to show as well.\n\n-----\n\n###Diet\n\nMy diet has improved, but it's still not ideal. I did notice a large difference once I started to consume more protein, usually 100-125g/day. I used to worry about not getting 1g/lb, but [examine](http://examine.com/faq/how-much-protein-do-i-need-every-day.html) seems to indicate the protein I'm consuming now is acceptable\u2014I have a single protein shake for breakfast every day. I'm not going to worry about my diet too much unless I stop making progress.\n\n-----\n\n###Moving forward\n\nWhen I first started I was overly optimistic about how fast I could make progress, but I've now realized how challenging most of the bodyweight movements are. For instance, I'm going to consider the planche \u201cmastered\u201d when I can hold a straddle, and I'm shooting for that in another 3\u20135 years (hopefully master FL and OAC in the meantime). \n\nThat said, I've really been enjoying the bodyweight/gymnastics side of exercise and plan to stick with it. I don't plan on changing my routine (or diet) anytime soon unless I stop making progress. My goal is to keep practicing the current movements until I master one, then replace it with something new. \n\nI encourage everyone to give bodyweight fitness a shot. Or at least, learn some of the easier skills; it's really fun to break out an elbow lever or a handstand when you are out with people.\nEATS_HUMANS: You look great! Nice tattoo by the way. Would you mind sharing the planche  and front lever progressions you used?\n\nEDIT: Specifically getting up to a tuck planche would be great. Also just realised your 6\"2, holy shit, this is great progress for a small person, never mind a giant!\ntolos: I just followed the prilepin tables http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2012/05/prilepin-tables-for-bodyweight-strength-isometric-and-eccentric-exercises/\n\nI either increase time\u20146x10s hold until I could do 5x12s, then 4x15s etc\u2014 or increase the difficulty (increased leverage). Nothing fancy.\nEATS_HUMANS: I see, but how did you from not being able to do a tuck planche to being able to do one?\nHawkbit: Getting the initial tuck planche is pretty frustrating (like trying to get your first pull up in a lot of ways).  I practiced frog stand for a while and tried doing straight arm frog stand before transitioning to tuck planche and honestly it wasn't efficient and didn't really work.  What worked for me was doing tuck planche with elastic band support (I believe this is part of the new progressions for the planche in the FAQ), it's a lot easier to scale the exercise that way.  Only spent two weeks using the bands before I just moved to unassisted tuck planche.\nRhinoMan2112: If you don't mind me asking, what kind of bands do you use/where did you get them,? I'm not sure how to buy them online if I can't test them out first, thanks!\nHawkbit: http://www.amazon.com/Black-Mountain-Products-Resistance-Exercise/dp/7245456313/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380054632&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=resistance+bands\n\nDifferent resistance weight for each band.\n\nYou can pick one up from any athletics store too\nRhinoMan2112: Thanks man! Exactly what I was looking for. Where do you hang yours from? Would they be long enough to hang from a pullup bar (about 6ft high to the ground)?\nHawkbit: I just put the resistance band handles onto a doorway pullup bar.  You can get creative, the bands have clips for a reason.  I'd say they are long enough, experiment a bit, and see what you're comfortable with\n", "prompt": "tolos: Six months of mostly bodyweight fitness (progress post)\n###Background\n\nI found Starting Strength a few years ago and tried it a few times in the intervening period, but I never really stuck with the program.

The supreme court has ruled it's acceptable to patent genes and sue anyone who uses that gene in any way.\n\n*edit* soon enough gene therapy will result in people carrying patented genes. When they mate with someone who hasn't paid for that gene they could be sued because their offspring carry the patented gene ala Monsanto successfully suing farmers because their crop was pollinated by neighboring fields growing Monsanto seedstock.\n\nThis is a serious issue and it kind of bothers me that you attempt to discredit my comment.\nEurgh: I'm legitimately interested in this - I know I can Google it but is there anywhere else I can get more info that *you* would recommend ?\nAngryFox: What are you interested in, specifically?  I'm intimately familiar with biotech patents and would be happy to point you to whatever you'd like.\nEurgh: Is there much weight to the idea that you could be sued for having an unpaid for patented gene? I mean that seems like an incredibly odd and hard thing to police. Additionally would we ever see every gene patented? What would that mean for further research etc?\n\nAlso, thanks!\n\n(Edited to say thanks.)\nAngryFox: Good questions, and this goes to the question posted by another above asking how are genes patentable to begin with.\n\nInitially, there is NO chance for someone to be found guilty of patent infringement for naturally possessing a patented gene. The primary reason for this is a result of the nature of the \"gene\" that is patented (you'll discover why I'm putting \"gene\" in quotes below).  *EDIT: Also, while cells, microorganisms, plants, and mice, etc. are patentable subject matter, humans are not (35 U.S.C. 101).*\n\nAt present, \"gene patents\" exist because of a minor distinction between what is actually patented and what exists in nature.  To understand this distinction you have to understand what a gene is.  The hierarchal structure of DNA could be described like this: genome &gt; gene &gt; exons + introns. (There's an additional caveat to this but as it has never been legally addressed I'm going to bypass it).  When a typical gene is expressed in a cell a copy of the gene in the genome (which is made of DNA) is made.  This copy is made from RNA, which comprises different building blocks than that used to make DNA.  This RNA copy is then processed to remove the introns.  The final copy is called mRNA and can be used as the template to make protein.\n\nNow, the composition (or \"gene\") that is ACTUALLY claimed in a patent is technically something that is none of these things (i.e., not found in nature) and, therefore, patentable.  Through a biochemical trick it is possible to take the mRNA for a gene and make a direct copy BACK into DNA (remember, different building blocks).  However, this copy (called cDNA) doesn't have any of the original introns in it (as those were processed out of the mRNA).  As a result, you have a DNA molecule comprising only exons and it is this molecule, in isolation, which is what is claimed in virtually all \"gene patents.\"\n\nIf you were to put a copy of this cDNA into a cell it would be treated no differently than the original from which it was copied: the cDNA would get expressed and processed into mRNA, only the cell would simply skip over the intron-processing step because there aren't any.  Everything else (and the downstream results, i.e., protein and function) are identical.  It is because of this that I believe the argument used to support \"gene patents,\" which is that the patented \"gene\" is wholely-unique from the naturally-occuring original gene, is merely a distinction without a difference.  If you took the sentence \"See [BLANK] Spot [BLANK] run\" from this paragraph and then you wrote the sentence \"See Spot run\" alone and in French elsewhere, can you honestly say you've created something novel and non-obvious?  Regardless, it's enough to keep the courts content.\n\nAs for whether a patent for every gene is inevitable I believe the answer depends only on whether a novel and non-obvious use can be found for every gene.  A utility patent must first-and-foremost be useful.  While the bar for this is low, there are thousands of known genes with known functions that aren't patented.  This fact guarantees that these genes (at least for their known functions) are in the public domain and, thus, are freely useable for these purposes (including research).\n\nI hope I've answered your questions.

Wagon wheels are clattering down the streets, the smell of horse shit and baked bread is thick in the air. There were a few earthquakes earlier, but you aren\u2019t worried. The wife freaks out every time, she remembers the big one 17 years ago. But they\u2019re common, no big deal. \n\nYou stop by your favorite little fast food shop for lunch, grab a nice plate of fish. You sit at a table in the back, play a few games of dice when you\u2019re done. Around one, a cloud starts rising out of the mountain. \n\nAn hour later, ash starts to fall. Then some tiny rocks. You head home, the wife is hysterical. She\u2019s packing up all the jewelry she can find. You tell her to stop being such a baby. She\u2019s always like this. \n\nYou look outside, people are leaving. Most are running down to the port to get on boats. You know better. Stupid conspiracy theorists, believing the gods are pissed or whatever. There goes Claudius, that dumbass. He never was very bright.\n\nAround five, the shit\u2019s hitting the fan. Almost everyone\u2019s gone. A nearby roof collapses. The ash is feet thick, blocking doors. Rocks the size of fists are crashing into the street. This, from the words of Pliny the Younger in a nearby town, who gives the only eyewitness account:\n\n&gt; \u201cWe could hear women shrieking, children crying and men shouting. Some were calling for their parents, their children, or their wives, and trying to recognize them by their voices. Some people were so frightened of dying that they actually prayed for death. Many begged for the help of the gods, but even more imagined that there were no gods left and that the last eternal night had fallen on the world.\u201d\n\nYou decide it\u2019s time to go. You and the wife haul ass. People are running with pillows on their heads. You stumble over a dead guy laying on the sidewalk, crushed by a rock. The air is thick with ash. You can\u2019t see.\n\nYou both seek shelter near the city gates, hoping it\u2019ll pass. It doesn\u2019t. She blames you. Maybe she\u2019s right. It keeps getting harder to breathe. You can\u2019t stop coughing. Eventually, a surge of ash, rocks, and superheated gas hits you. It\u2019s all over. Your bodies are buried. \n\n**The bodies**\n\nIn the mid-1800\u2019s, excavators were finding voids in the ash and mud surrounding bones. They poured plaster into these spaces, and what emerged were the molds of bodies, many left posed just as they were in their last moments.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about the exact way they died. There always are, right? Scientists and historians constantly argue about details. Many long thought they died instantaneously, the bodies shocked and contorted. \n\nBut a recent study says that\u2019s impossible, due to the fragments of clothing they found. Ready for something morbid? Probably. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here, right? Well, If it wasn\u2019t hot enough to burn all the fabric, then\u2026it must have happened slowly. Humans can survive temperatures around 400-500 degrees Fahrenheit for a few minutes. So, do the math. Burned to death somewhat slowly, or died due to inhaling superheated gas. \n\nObviously, I made up the story at the beginning. After all, we know little about the individual people who didn\u2019t make it. The guy in the picture is called the \u201cMuleteer,\u201d because his body was found next to that of a mule, in the Palaestra: basically a large open field with a pool, surrounded by buildings and columns. It was a place for exercise, and it\u2019s near the edge of town. \n\nHe was found crouching near the bathroom, his back against the wall. The imprints of fabric were found around his legs, possibly using a cloak to shield himself from the heat. Was he trying to get out of town and stopped when it became too tough? Probably. Was the mule his? Was he trying to ride it away? Maybe. We\u2019ll never know. \n\n**The victims**\n\nYou probably want more, right? Yeah, I thought so. People on here are super into hot fiery death.  You sickos. \n\nA man was found in the same place as the Muleteer, clutching a wooden box filled with surgical tools. It seems likely he was a doctor, looking to help victims. \n\nA woman was near the city gates, carrying a gold and silver statue of Mercury. A big group in a garden near another gate, possibly a large family with children. \n\nA man and a woman were found with two kids, hiding under a staircase in a lavish home. The staircase collapsed and killed them. \n\nA child found alone in the Central Baths, likely separated from her family and hiding. \n\nThirteen sheltered in a home, many related \u2014 including one very pregnant woman in her late teens. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t mobile, and they were staying with her. \n\nA group weighed down with jewels and coins \u2014 either all wealthy, or looters who pillaged homes after their residents fled. \n\nA large group was found in a massive home, presumably slaves. The exits were all blocked, and ten were trying to climb up to the second floor to get out a window. Three others were found using a pickaxe and a hoe to dig a tunnel. \n\n**Why?**\n\nI guess the obvious question here is why so many died. About 2,000 were killed, out of a town of 20,000. Obviously, there was time to bail. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one answer. They used to believe all the victims were elderly or disabled, but modern science has proven that wrong. Surely, there were some with kids who couldn\u2019t move fast enough. And there were some elderly people with arthritis. And one guy found in the street had long suffered from a bone infection in his leg. \n\nBut people back then weren\u2019t all that different from people today. There\u2019s always those who ignore hurricane warnings or stand outside to watch tornadoes, right? I\u2019m sure many figured others were being hysterical, and they knew better. Right up until it was too late. \n\nIn closing, you want to hear something really weird? Apparently the Muleteer had no arms. I came across one article that said they discovered the plaster arms were added on. I\u2019m not sure how accurate this is, because there\u2019s many other references that don\u2019t mention this. If it\u2019s true, did he have a birth defect? Did someone chop them off? Is that why he didn\u2019t make it out in time? Yet another unsolvable mystery to add to the pile. \n\nSorry if you came here hoping for a lot of jokes, but the subject matter seemed a bit heavy for that. But no, it\u2019s not too heavy for me to skip the opportunity to plug my Instagram [@rayoboone](https://instagram.com/rayoboone). I\u2019m shameless.

I just don't like to stay with my relatives, I don't hate them, I don't love them, I just dislike being around them, I don't feel comfortable and social. I'm 19 and my Mom wants me to visit them weekly, and when I refuse, she assumes I have a problem with them, because she says that every single person loves to visit their relatives every week and so should I (which is true in my country). Today, I went there but I was a little upset because I had to go there where they only care about how expensive your outfits are, and how fake you can be around them like my cousin does (I know he's faking his personality because he's my best friend). Therefore, my Mom got mad and told me that I will never make any friends in my life and that nobody will ever want to talk me to me because I look ugly and nobody will ever be interested in me for how pathetic I am, despite me having friends. And this is when I realized that my Mom is actually and unfortunately an asshole, not because I was affected by her words, but who in the right mind tells their son that he's ugly and nobody wants to talk to him for the rest of his life? Anyway I'm not here to deal with my Mother, I'm just here to ask for an advice on how to interact with them, even though I really don't want to.\ndestinysolitude35: Easy, YOU DON\u2019T. Like Phantom said, family can be overrated. My father is the biggest a**hole psychopath I know. I left the house and moved to another country 17 years ago. Out of these 17 years I\u2019ve been back home 5 times. All those times there was drama. I promised myself to never go back there again. That was three years ago. Haven\u2019t spoke with him since then and very sporadically with my mother via WhatsApp. Unfortunately some families are just so dysfunctional where the best thing you can do for yourself is to remove yourself from it. You are already out of that environment, stay away. Don\u2019t fall for them trying to guilt trip you. My brother did and he finally snapped two days ago and almost had a full panic attack as he left the house. That can\u2019t be healthy for you. Do your thing, and pop on holidays and don\u2019t give two damns about what they say, maybe one day they\u2019ll realize their wrongdoing. I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath thou. My father still firmly believe he never did anything to us and he was a perfect example as a father. Completely delusional. Good luck bro, and keep your head up. They don\u2019t deserve you.  \nd8os-bodeech: You can't be more right. But I just realized I wasn't clear in my question, I actually meant relatives as (uncles, aunts, cousins, etc...) and I don't really hate them, I just don't want to be around them. Yesterday, I said \"they make me sick\" and my Mom went insane, she got too frustrated because I said this about her family. I might have over-exaggerated in that insult, but I had to tell the truth, I simply don't get along with them, they only care about how expensive your outfits are, and saying the things that you like to hear every week. I don't have a problem with my parents, but our family and relatives are very big, and every single teenager-adult loves to visit them, but it's just not me, and that's why my Mother is frustrated, she doesn't want to handle the fact that I'm the only one who dislikes visiting them. I don't see why my Mother wants me there anyways, they really don't care about me anyways, because they know I'm doing alright. They only like my other cousin who fails his University years over and over, because his life is full of drama and failure, and he wears those fancy outfits and he has a very bad attitude, and that's what they want. \ndestinysolitude35: Pft who cares about uncles and aunts? That\u2019s even easier. Like you said, you are \u201cdoing alright\u201d. Some people just like to gossip so to talk to someone that has no drama is borderline boring to them. Next time Mom mention visiting them, tell her you have a special project to work on or have to work that day. Just deflect it. Your mom also is part of the issue and it shouldn\u2019t be freaking out about this.

They also draw the checks upon established accounts so that it looks less suspicious why a large corporation would be cutting you a check vs some random nobody. This is also why these scams are usually \"secret shopper\" or \"employment\" varieties because people are more willing to swallow a scam if there is a task involved.\nCaptain_Alaska: &gt;If I give someone a fake check with today's date on it, they can take it into their bank and cash it immediately. Some banks will refuse to cash any check older than a few days, so if I tell someone \"don't cash this for a week\" and they are dumb enough to do it, then by the time they bring it in to cash it, my account is closed and cleared out.\n\nRight, and they will give you the money immediately, process it over the course of 3 business days, work out the account doesn't have money, and then take it back. \n\nThe person has already fucked off in those 3 days and you don't have your money.\n\nIf that same check was post-dated a week in the future, the only difference is you would work out the account doesn't have money a week and 3 business days later.\nOhokanotherthrowaway: &gt;Right, and they will give you the money immediately, process it over the course of 3 business days, work out the account doesn't have money, and then take it back.\n\nYou're not getting it. So let's make this into a little story:\n\nI am a scammer who is trying to buy a car. I come across a good mark who is dumb enough to accept a post-dated check. I give them a $5000 check for the car and tell them \"now don't cash this until next friday. I have some lottery winnings coming in that will post then\". My victim takes the check home and waits seven days until next friday to bring my check for deposit into his bank (because his bank refuses to accept any post dated checks at all). He deposits the check, then 1-3 business days later, my bank returns the check as \"account closed\". The money is withdrawn from the victim's account. The scammer gets to keep the car.\n\nThis is why you should NEVER accept a post-dated check unless it's from someone you trust A LOT.\nCaptain_Alaska: Right. I meet up with the seller at the bank. I give the seller the check for $5k. He immediatly gives the check to the bank. The bank deposits $5k into his account.\n\nI drive off in the car.\n\n1-3 business days later the check bounces and the bank takes the money back.\n\nI still have the car.\n\nThe 1-3 business day timer starts when the bank gets the check. Not when it's written. That's the time it takes the bank to process the transaction with the other bank that has the money. They can't start processing it until you give them the check. It does not matter how long or how little the other party has the check, it will take that same 1-3 business days to process regardless if it's given to the bank that second or 3 months later.\nOhokanotherthrowaway: Notice my story didn't feature someone who immediately deposited the check nor are they meeting up in a bank parking lot, which is the smart thing to do. \n\nIf you read it carefully you will notice **the victim not only accepts a post dated check, they wait a week to cash it.** A lot of banks won't accept post dated checks at all, so if a scammer post dates a check, then the victim will be unable to cash it until the date of the check and by then, the account is closed and the scammer is in a different state. \n\nNot sure why you struggle to understand this.\n\nIn your example, the victim is depositing the check immediately. This also means that the scammer needs to be moving to a different town within 1-3 business days. \n\nIn my example, the scammer has an entire week to scam people because he KNOWS no bank will accept a post dated check. The scammer has a full 7 days to scam people before he needs to leave. \n\nDo you get it now? Your scenario gives them 3 days max to scam people in that city. My scenario gives the scammer 7-10 days to scam people.\nCaptain_Alaska: Why does the scammer need a week to leave town? Why do they need to wait a week? The account not having money is your problem, not the banks. The police aren't going to rock up on his doorstep as soon as it bounces, lol.\n\nThere's literally no difference to the scammer, if he doesn't pick up your desperate phone calls asking for money you'll have to go through the police and court system which will inevitably take much more time.\n\nAnd like what do you think the scammer is doing here? 'Aww geez I really want to rob this guy but I can't move towns for another week so I'll post date this check'? Would he not just, y'know, rob the guy a week later and move town the next day...?\n\nLike I'm fully aware your senario means he gets more time, I am arguing it makes literally no difference because checks inherently take several days to process. Literally all the guy has to do is convince you he has the money long enough to take the product off you. He could roll down the window and tell you the check is fake as soon as he pulls out of the driveway and you'd still be just as fucked.\nOhokanotherthrowaway: &gt;Why do they need to wait a week?\n\nYou still don't get it. So let me ask some super simple question to try and guide you into the right answer:\n\nCan you do more things in 3 days or 10 days? Like, if I'm making a widget and I can make one widget a day, how many widgets will I have in 3 days?\n\nThe answer is three because I can make one widget every day and since 3 x 1 = 3 that means I can make three widgets. \n\nSo let's replace \"widget\" with \"scam\": can I do more scams in 3 or 10 days (and let's assume I do one scam a day)?\n\nThe answer is 10 days. If I am doing one scam a day and I have ten days to work, I can do ten scams. \n\nNow let's talk about the banks and what role they play. \n\nVery few banks accept post dated checks. Some reject them outright. So if I am a scammer I will only select the banks that solely reject all post dated checks. Now, if I give someone a post dated check, I know that my bank will ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to cash the check. If they take it to their bank instead, that bank will refuse to cash it because the check is post dated a week. \n\nSo now the victim has a check they can't cash for 7 days. This gives me seven days to continue to scam other people in the area. This increases the loot I steal because I have more time to work before my scam is exposed. After my scam is exposed I need to leave town to prevent myself from being arrested. \n\nTherefore, post dating checks gives me more time to perform scams than if I didn't post date it. \n\nDoes that help? It seems like you really struggle with this concept.\nCaptain_Alaska: Mate you're assuming people are one big hivemind and as soon as one person works out he doesn't have money the entire town knows.\n\nImagine the guy is messaging on Facebook. he's got a fake name and a profile picture with a 1999 Ford F-150 because rednecks having profile pictures of their truck isn't unusual. He messages some chick on Facebook Marketplace for a car. He meets up with her, gives her the shit check, and drives off with the car.\n\nWhat is the girl going to do, complain that a 21 year old pickup truck called Joe has her car and $5k? Why can't he do the exact same fucking thing with normal checks to somebody else, again, and again, and again, until someone gets lucky and catches him on some CCTV footage somewhere and can eventually get to the police?\nOhokanotherthrowaway: &gt;Mate you're assuming people are one big hivemind and as soon as one person works out he doesn't have money the entire town knows.\n\nI made no such assertion. Please find where I did because I didn't say this. \n\nThe police exist you know. If someone gets ripped off, the first place they're headed is the police. The police can take his statement and then they'll start looking for the scammer. Even if only one cop is looking for the scammer that's one more cop than before. \n\nWhy do you struggle so hard with this concept? Criminals like to not have their schemes discovered because it means the law might be after them. The longer they can delay discovery the longer they can scam. This is why criminals use masks. Protip.\nCaptain_Alaska: Police can't do much with 'white bloke with a beard and brown hair' or some equally vague shit description.\n\nIf you don't have something concrete the police can work with they'll happily take your statement and immediately file it way.\n\nNobody is going to do much of anything unless you managed to capture his face on a camera of some description or memorized the licence plate and/or vehicle he showed up with, assuming it or the plate wasn't stolen either.\nOhokanotherthrowaway: &gt; Nobody is going to do much of anything unless you managed to capture his face on a camera of some description or memorized the licence plate and/or vehicle he showed up with, assuming it or the plate wasn't stolen either.\n\nIf a scammer tried to do a check scam on me, I'd whip out my phone and immediately take a picture. I'd then immediately go to the police and give them the picture of the check scammer. \n\nThis was recently on Reddit where someone was going around a neighborhood telling people they worked for Google and trying to get into people's houses. Their picture was being circulated with the warning they were scamming people. \n\nAnd this is why scammers do everything they can to delay the discovery of their scam, because once a **single** dedicated person takes their picture, then the police now have their picture. \n\nAre you starting to understand now?\n", "prompt": "Ohokanotherthrowaway: Definitely depends on the bank since the treasury says that post dated checks are negotiable. \n\nThink about it this way: if I give you a check then say \"don't cash this until next week\", why did I even give you the check if you can't cash it for a", "orig": "week?

CMV! :)\nFallingSnowAngel: Are we talking about polygamy in an ideal world, as an abstract, or polygamy in a world where wealthy men frequently compete to accumulate as many beautiful wives as possible, replacing them as needed, while their sons are treated as disposable and unwanted pieces of trash? \n\nBecause polygamy is beautiful, until you bring all that ugliness into it. \nimjusthereforkitties: I don't see where the comment about the fate of the sons comes from. Surely they'd still have loving mothers even if their father was busy with business or a bunch of other children? But then there exist traditionally married families with children in the double figures or uncaring, work-driven fathers so this isn't the fault of polygamy. \n\nI really don't see how anything you've said is worse than the current state of marriage in which wealthy men have wives and several mistresses. Any why is that morally wrong anyway? The women live in splendor and the man gets his sexy time. They're all consenting adults here.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: One man having 20 wives creates a surplus of male children that must be driven off to preserve the status quo, this is how polygamy is practiced in the real world. \nimjusthereforkitties: Contraception?\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: How would contraception help? They want numerous children, they don't want men to compete for wives with. \nimjusthereforkitties: Oh i thought the kids would be accidents if they were being driven away upon maturation. Well that sucks, though i still think polygamy would go down differently in western culture...but i guess this is what FallingSnowAngel said about polygamy's difference as an abstract and an ideal.\ndontmovedontmoveahhh: Polygamy is in like this in America in fundamentalist morman communities, that might not be the West you were thinking of but it's hard to think of a religion more American. The problem with polygamy is that it can't be a relationship between equals. The man makes the decisions and the women have to live with it. I don't have a problem with polyamory, but a system where a man can have an unlimited number of wives to use and control does seem morally and ethically suspect. If people have freedom to choose, education, opportunities it doesn't seem like a relationship that is based on women being property would organically arise. While monogamy has it's roots in property exchange, we have dating today, marriage is based on friendship, love, affection, commitment regardless of gender and not the economic and political institution it was originally created to be. Egalitarian group marriage is a whole nother can of worms, nothing wrong with having a poly family and it obviously works for some but I can't begin to imagine how to address the issue legislatively. If marriage is about love and building a life and creating a family (not necessarily children) then we should be able to find a way, but we certainly haven't gotten there yet.\n", "prompt": "AlienArchitect: I do not see anything morally or ethically wrong with polygamy.

Thanks\nsunnyday420: So when light is propagating through a medium of water its going to be observed to travel 30% slower and when it leaves the water it speeds back up. So to calculate light you need to know the medium its propagating through. Which leads to how the medium of space is not an authentic medium, and the distances to the luminaries/stars are actually much closer than the failed calculations say. \n\nThen more importantly they are treating light as a particle AND a sound wave. This is false. There is no particle of light according to nikola tesla, he had an explanation as to why.. the background medium of ether that exists that enables the soundwave of light to propagate through. So that light is not an emission, its a perturbation in the ether!!\n\nWith this old way of how light functions which is closer to the truth, the speed of light as you know it is debunked\nWhat_the_what_show: Well, that\u2019s really interesting and I thank you for sharing it. If this is the case then why isn\u2019t it the norm?\nsunnyday420: Because what nikola tesla was teaching was too accurate and liberating in my opinion. Knowledge is power and to understand light would be too empowering. It could be weaponized and it liberate humanity and remove the wealth disparities. \n\nI appreciate you hearing me out because i get alot of bad reactions when i explain the ether. People think its outdated and debunked.\n\nSo the ether was called \"quintessence\" by the greek philosophers and \"prime material\" in alchemy. There are like hundreds of names for the ether in different cultures and everyone acknowledged it until 1915 with einsteins theory of relativity. \n\nIn his theory of relativity it gives you medium of dark matter and spacetime. But really he is just renaming the ether and confusing people.\n\nDo you have your ETHERnet chord plugged in? \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d\nWhat_the_what_show: Often is the case where modern science can solve mysteries or update our views/knowledge. Do you not think it\u2019s logical that this has been done with ether? Many ideas of the Greeks were also mythology. Do you have some reference material you would recommend?\nsunnyday420: \"a picture can paint a thousand words\" so when ancient civilizations and greeks were using symbols and stories, you called it mythology. well turns out they were artfully describing the sky because the sky is really important. for example zues is jupiter.  the sumarians called it \"Dapinu\", or for the norse they called it thor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what you think are made up fantasy stories are actually describing the sky because the sky is really important. thats why they will spend so many resources faking space missions and stuff is to deceive you about what the sky really is. for only if you knew what the sky really was, it would empower you too much to be controlled.\n", "prompt": "What_the_what_show: What is a LightYear and How Far is it?\n\nsunnyday420: No this is wrong because there is no particle of light and you dont know what medium its propagating through also\nWhat_the_what_show: Would you mind explaining a little further?

I countersunk the lag bolts so at a later date I can cover the 2x4s, wires, and outlet up with some kind of panel. I used 2x4s and long lag bolts instead of 1x4s or 1x3s because of the extreme amount of torque the TV at full extension could produce, despite the relatively low weight.\nDoyouwantaspoon: How long were your 2x4&gt;stud lag bolts? And what kind of hardware did you use to attach the mount to the 2x4s?\nn17ikh: I believe I used 4\" lag bolts to mount the 2x4s to the wall, and counter sunk some carriage bolts on the wall side of the 2x4s so I could attach the mount with the nuts on the mount's side, where they could be covered by the plastic decorative cover that came with the mount. I don't remember what diameter carriage bolts I used, whatever the biggest I could buy that would fit through the holes in the mount. Probably 1/4\u201d.\nDoyouwantaspoon: A carriage bolt, like with the square end before the round head?

You don't need any extra countersinking for the square part, it's what grabs the wood and stops the bolt from turning when you put the nut on the front side. A different approach could be T-nuts on the backside of the wood with regular bolts from the front, instead of carriage bolts. That might actually be better since they're made to grip better in wood.\nDoyouwantaspoon: I have very little knowledge of carpentry hardware, so I'd never even heard of t-nuts, but they look perfect!

Rather, I have once heard of a study citing that skipping breakfast can trigger an insulin response which would immediately store any and all calories ingested throughout the day into fat. \n\n\nDoes this have any credibility behind it? Does skipping breakfast help your weight loss personally? \nscreepatrol: Any studies that have weird findings about skipping meals or eating 8 meals a day or whatever are either 1) paid for their results by the industry or 2) terribly controlled. \n\nEat once a day. Eat 8 times a day. Eat only during a certain period or snack all day. Your body is great at partitioning calories and the effects of when you eat that food are somewhere between negligible and nonexistent. \n\nToo often people look at what professional bodybuilders/weightlifters/strongmen do and think that's how you succeed. Those guys are at the top level and the only thing left is to focus on the last 1%. The other 99% is controlling your calories/macros and progressive overload in training. \n\nDon't overthink this. \nSpicyThingy: Its not about the calories. Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000% which leads to better fat burning and better muscle growth. That doesnt have to do with sponsorships, it is just measureing. \nNihilii: &gt; increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over\n\nSo is it up to, or is it over? Or does \"up to over 1000%\" mean anywhere between 0 and infinity? I mean that would surely be correct, but not very useful.\n\nAnd do you have any source for those revelations?\nSpicyThingy: Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass. \nNihilii: &gt;Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass.\n\nWell, it's not my first language either, and \"up to and over\" is a classic marketing spiel (that crops up not just in english), which is why I'm giving you attitude for doing it. \n\nBut to the point - your own source, a single study mind you, so not a very strong ground to declare something as a hard fact, has found a 1000% increase in mean GH level after **5 days of fasting**. They were also **injecting the subjects with Growth-Hormone Releasing Hormone**. Based on that you say this:\n\n&gt;Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\nSo even forgetting that slip of the tongue there, you are still clearly suggesting that just intermittent fasting can give you a tenfold GH increase. This is naive at best, and purposefully misleading at worst. How can you consider that study in any way comparable to a person doing something like a typical 16/8 intermittent fasting schedule? \n\nSeriously. You either haven't read the paper you linked or you're sensationalizing this on purpose. I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nYou don't get to pull the asshole card when you're lying to people.\nthoughtihadanacct: While the 1000% claim by u/SpicyThingy may be an exaggeration (deliberate or not I can\u2019t say), it is also unfair of you to entirely discredit the study he cited based on the reasons you have given.\n\nIn figures 2 and 3 and table 1 of the study, it clearly shows that GH concentration increases from fasting even on day 1. Yes the effect on day 1 may be lower than on day 5, and again the 1000% claim may have been misleading. However you seem to be implying that the benefits of fasting with regard to HGH only happen after 5 days, and you claim that the study in no way has bearing on 16:8 fasting. The fact that there is some (albeit lower) effect on day 1 of fasting suggests that 16/8 fasting may have some benefits (albeit lower than say 5 day fasting).\n\nYou boldly state that the reserchers injected the subjects with GHRH, in an attempt to discredit the study. This was dishonest. While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed. And from fig 2 the effects of the injection do not last more than about 3 hours. The injections were done to investigate the effect of fasting on GHRH sensitivity. (True the study could have been \u201cbetter\u201d by focusing on only one thing at a time, but it stands that the injections don\u2019t negate the findings regarding GH release.)\n\nIn the end what Im saying is that it\u2019s not binary - ie it\u2019s not \u201cfasting results in 1000% increase in GH\u201d vs \u201cbullshit the study is meaningless/useless\u201d. What I\u2019m arguing is that fasting does increase GH levels to some extent. More (longer) fasting results in more increase. The exact magnitude of increase is variable and probably differs from person to person.\nNihilii: I never said the study is meaningless. I said what the guy said was misleading and even the single study he picked to support his position does not do so. You can't just sling around some numbers from a study without looking at the context. This was an extremely sloppy attempt at backing one's claims with science.\n\n&gt;While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed.\n\nWell, that's my bad then. It was not clear to me from the study design that the post-GHRH injection measurements were not included in the later analysis and I can't honestly say I read the thing front-to-back since it was pretty late that night. In-depth analysis of this study was not my point though, as I said.\nthoughtihadanacct: \u201cthe single study he picked to support his position does not do so.\u201d\n\nDepends what (you think) his position is. If his position is literally that fasting for 16 hours a day increases GH levels by 1000% in every human being, then yes the study does not support it. However if we are a bit more generous and assume his position is that fasting \u201csignificantly\u201d increases GH level in general, then I believe the study does support that position to some extent.\n", "prompt": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would", "orig": "usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for.

You never go with zip ties again, not in bundles anyway they amhave some use but I use Velcro everywhere I can now\nSoulWager: I paid $4 for flush cutters that can trim the zip ties without leaving exposed sharp edges. So I do still use them when it's likely to be permanent.\nrudyjewliani: Great. Now go back and do everybody else's shitty install on every other patch cable in the building. \n\nOtherwise, you just wasted $4.\nCaptainSolo_: Your logic is odd.\nrudyjewliani: And this is why not everybody should do every job.\n\nIf the person I replied to bought a fancy flush cutter, it doesn't make reaching into a rats nest of cables any safer unless that person flush cuts every single zip tie in the entire nest. \n\nOtherwise, they spent $4, AND people are still cutting their hand from the plastic edges. \n\nIn reality, that person is never going to go back and redo every single zip tie, so the money they spent doesn't actually fix the problem. \n\nI have no idea why some people can't see this very basic logic.\nCaptainSolo_: Seatbelts mate. \n\nWearing one doesn\u2019t fix everyone else\u2019s problems, but it will have an impact on yours. \n\nThe benefit of making the task safer for everyone going forward is worth the $4.\n\nIteration is good. To not do something simply because it can\u2019t be applied 100% or retroactively is silly. Strive for and embrace progression.  \n\nIs your preference to literally do nothing?\nrudyjewliani: That's a bad metaphor. Because unless you're trying to compare someone reaching their hand into a mess of cables to a car wreck... it doesn't work. Because people keep their server racks longer than most people update cars. Hell, I've worked on closets that were originally wired in the 60s, and hadn't been updated since the 90s. \n\nIt *doesn't* make things safer going forward though. Again, UNLESS they do every bit of cable in the building. If OP only does half a closet, people still cut their hands, or only every other closet then people still cut their hands on the closets they didn't do. \n\nIf OP *does* do every closet, then sure. That's exactly what I said. Better for everybody.\nCaptainSolo_: So again, by your admission if he does some, Then there will be less pokey cable ties. An improvement on him not doing it at all, resulting in more pokey cable ties. \n\nYou acknowledge the positive effects but would rather abandon the effort due to its slow progress, or at very least stagnation. \n\nI believe any improvement, even minimal is a good thing.  .01% a day at a time eventually gets you there. By your logic, you never will.\nrudyjewliani: So... in one scenario the person gets cuts on their hand, and in the other scenario the person gets cuts on their hand AND you spend $4. \n\nYou coulda got the same results without spending a dime, mate.\nCaptainSolo_: There are 100 uncut ties. Redditor adds 50 ties and cuts them each of them. \n\nNow there are 150 total ties\n100 of them are uncut.\n50 of them are cut.\n\nSo, where you used to have 100% chance of being cut on a tie.\n\nNow, there is a 66.7% chance of being cut in a tie. \n\n***if*** Redditor adds any at all. \n\nIf no ties are added, and Redditor snips one or two occasionally, at ***any*** rate, the chance of being cut on a tie also decreases. \n\nYou\u2019re trolling me right? This seems elementary.\nrudyjewliani: &gt;This seems elementary.\n\nAhh yes, the ever increasing need for statistics to rule what common sense says otherwise.\n\nLet's throw a real world example, using your statistics.\n\nYesterday, there was an 85% chance that if you stick your hand in this particular mess you're going to cut yourself. Are you going to put your hand in there?\n\n1. You don't know that it's an 85% chance. \n\n2. Even if you did, you probably wouldn't stick your hand in there.\n\nToday, there's a 75% chance that you'll cut yourself. \n\n1. You don't know it's a 75% chance.\n\n2. Even if you did, you probably wouldn't stick your hand in there.\n\nTomorrow, there's going to be a 65% chance. Are you going to stick your hand in there?\n\n1. You don't know it's a 65% chance.\n\n2. You're still probably not going to stick your hand in there.\n\n\nNow, we've gone three days without sticking our hand in there. Why in god's good name would you ever want to stick your hand in there? \n\nFurther, you don't know when OP has come by, so you don't know when the chances go down. Further, you don't know what the chances were before, or after OP came by.\n\nStatically, they're \"less\". But less than what? You don't know. Less by how much? You don't know. The fact of the matter is... OP spent money and you're still not sticking your hand in that mess.\nCaptainSolo_: Less than any other point where there were more uncut cables. \n\nRegardless of knowing the exact percentages, the outcome is the same. Less chance of being cut on a cable tie. *This is why we wear seatbelts * and helmets, or take any safety measure.\n\nYou\u2019d stick your hand in there, as everyone has already brought up, because it is an area that will be worked in again. Hence, the need for cutting the ties in the first place. \n\nAnd the $4 dollars you\u2019ve spent you\u2019ve already lost in time arguing with me. Forget the four dollars. Yes, it\u2019s a factor here, but I think we can agree it is not requisite to our discussion as it has evolved.\n\nEdit to add: even in your example you recognize that the chances have decreased. This making the venture worth while if the goal is to reduce the likelihood of being cut on a cable tie.\nrudyjewliani: &gt; Regardless of knowing the exact percentages, the outcome is the same. \n\nExactly. The outcome is \"I'm not sticking my hand in there.\"\n\nAnd OP wasted $4.\nCaptainSolo_: That\u2019s an odd way to concede. Nevertheless, I accept.

The standard NRA attitude comes off as way more arrogant and ignorant.

I also, really don't see this point being confused frequently.\nPackin_Penguin: &gt;clips\n\nI think he's trolling us now.\n\n(This is YSK. That's why I'm pointing it out)\nrockstang: And I'm pointing out that it makes little difference if its fully auto or semiautomatic. Not trolling. And just making a ysk doesn't mean it is a valid point. And again, I think most people know what we would classify as an assault rifle. \nthat_dude_you_know: They're making fun of you for calling them clips instead of magazines.\nrockstang: I get that. It's funny how they believe that makes a valid point. It is a red herring to distract. \nLagkiller: &gt;  It is a red herring to distract. \n\nNot particularly.  You made a specific comment that you were a gun owner and then proceeded to say clips.  Gun owners don't say clips, 15 years playing COD all day say clips.  It is an invalidation of your supposed gun owner status.\nrockstang: I don't have anything to prove to someone who has no interest in having the debate to begin with. Again, throw all of the red herrings you want it proves nothing but the unwillingness to have a realistic dialog. But at the end of the day I do own 2 firearms (assuming that fits the name you like to use.)\nLagkiller: &gt; I don't have anything to prove to someone\n\nYou didn't have to prove anything to anyone, you chose to supply your \"credentials\" as a gun owner.  You brought it upon yourself.\n\n&gt;Again, throw all of the red herrings you want it proves nothing but the unwillingness to have a realistic dialog.\n\nI'll have a dialog with an honest person.  You are clearly not a gun owner and have a very specific agenda.  Admit that, and we can have a realistic dialog.  Until then, you are the only one making the dialog unrealistic.\nrockstang: OK so I don't agree with your agenda so I am automatically discredited. I also say I roll down my window. Windows have been automatic for at least 20 years. I suppose by your logic I've never owned or driven a car? Why do I say clip and roll down your window? Because that is what I have always said.  And fuck it let's entertain your idea. I am a gun owner, but let's say for instance that I'm not. As a voting adult my say is every bit as important and valid as yours. Now let's take this all the way back to my original point. Making a distinction between automatic and semiautomatic is a silly one considering without a dealers license and permission from your county sherrif (in pa) owning a fully automatic isn't even possible. And again, if a semi auto can be fired at such a rate it is really just semantics whether you are firing 100 rounds per minute or 160. So yes in the bigger picture I think this YSK is a silly distinction to argue. But at the end of the day you take the same stance that nearly every NRA member does; if you are not with me you are against me. This is called the all or nothing fallacy. You call me dishonest but you really know nothing about me. I think the only one being dishonest is you saying you would be objective about this if I wasn't such a nasty little liar. School yard logic really isn't going to work here.\nLagkiller: &gt; OK so I don't agree with your agenda\n\nWow, did you actually read what I said?  Apparently not.  \n\n&gt;Windows have been automatic for at least 20 years. I suppose by your logic I've never owned or driven a car? \n\nNo, you are making a rather absurd analogy.  Clip is an actual tool, still in use today in guns manufactured.  It is a specific type of loading mechanism.  This is more akin to you saying you fill your car with diesel when you mean gasoline.\n\n&gt;I am a gun owner, but let's say for instance that I'm not. As a voting adult my say is every bit as important and valid as yours.\n\nNo shit sherlock.  The problem I have is that you are trying to pretend to be a gun owner as a means of drawing sympathy.  \"Hey guys, I own guns and I think these gun owners are wrong\".  Just as impersonating a army ranger at a bar to pick up chicks is wrong.\n\n&gt; Now let's take this all the way back to my original point. Making a distinction between automatic and semiautomatic is a silly one considering without a dealers license and permission from your county sherrif (in pa) owning a fully automatic isn't even possible.\n\nIt is a very important distinction, especially to people who don't own guns like yourself.  Have you ever fired a fully automatic weapon?  You can't just hold down the trigger for the entire magazine, they don't work like that.  But, people who have no working knowledge of firearms think [they are just that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJmFEv6BHM0).\n\nThese kinds of statements are ridiculous.  30 rounds in half a second sounds incredibly dangerous, even though it is impossible with the weapon he is holding, let alone any legal weapon in the US.\n\n&gt;But at the end of the day you take the same stance that nearly every NRA member does; if you are not with me you are against me.\n\nI am quite sure you don't even know what my stance is.  I do find it funny that you compare me to the NRA as I have not ever been a member, but ok.\n\n&gt;You call me dishonest but you really know nothing about me.\n\nYou claim to be a gun owner but several times have stated things that even the most basic gun owner knows are wrong.  You are lying to gain sympathy to your argument.\n\n&gt;I think the only one being dishonest is you saying you would be objective about this if I wasn't such a nasty little liar. School yard logic really isn't going to work here.\n\nAnd yet you keep using it?\nrockstang: I'm not going to be specific. You are exactly what is wrong with the whole debate. If they don't agree, they aren't a gun owner. All or nothing fallacy, look it up. Your opinion is short sited and one sided. Don't state you are open to debate when you're not.\nLagkiller: &gt; I'm not going to be specific.\n\nBut you want to have a \"realistic convesation\"??\n\n&gt;You are exactly what is wrong with the whole debate.\n\nThere isn't a debate because of your previous statement.\n\n&gt;If they don't agree, they aren't a gun owner.\n\nNot even remotely what I said, or even implied.\n\n&gt;All or nothing fallacy, look it up. \n\nHow have I committed a fallacy when I haven't even stated what you claimed?\nrockstang: Look it up instead of responding troll.\nLagkiller: So I'm whats wrong with the debate when all you are doing is attacking me instead of my argument?

I am holding a UV flashlight in my hand to make it glow.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/6LyOQ\nPhotoandGrime: Cheers, I know what vitamin B2 is ;P. I've used it many times before to create glow food, I made these yellow glow noodles with them for example: http://imgur.com/KrjxXe8 or this green glow jelly:http://i.imgur.com/XGRBfSR.gifv. You can also make Turmeric UV reactive by adding pure alcohol to it btw! Not to use in food though, but other glow experiments :). \njagedlion: If you are using to use high proof EtOH (I used everclear), another really cool one is just mint. (I guess any other plant, but mint is actually tasty)  I don't have a great pic on my phone, just a boring one.  But chlorophyll, while UV opaque, also fluoresces purple-red.  So if you shine the beam on them, while none of the light penetrates, the surface where the beam is aimed turns from green to glowing red.  It's quite striking, but the fluorescence seems to pretty much vanish if you add water.\n\nI still haven't found something that keeps a nice red glow in aqueous solvents.\nPhotoandGrime: XD Hahaha cheers, I know this too! I have a youtube channel dedicated to glow stuff hehe. I made UV reactive cupcakes with chlorophyll: http://i.imgur.com/Oo7s319.gifv. Green in normal light, pink in black light. I have two recipes in which I used chlorophyll online. You can extract chlorophyll with oil, butter or pure alcohol. Unfortunately the pure alcohol version isn't edible of course, and indeed, water destroys the UV reactiveness of chlorophyll. A shame, because I would love to create an edible colour pigment with it without butter/oil, so you can colour a bunch of food. I have done a bunch of experiments but haven't found a solution to it as of now. Where does your fascination for glow food come from?\njagedlion: I started making glowing test-tube shooters in college.  Classic vodka-tonic with a little artificial flavoring and sometimes coloring.  But I didn't go back to it until more recently.  My wife had a friend who was graduating with her PhD in philosophy of science, so I thought it would be fun to have a science themed meal.  I figure I do enough microscopy I should be able to enhance my old gamut.\n\nWe made some tonic from cinchona bark (which came out _ok_ but I wouldn't recommend it) and I then made a range of colored drinks.  The blue and green were easy, but for red I just made the mint extract, and then mixed it into mojitos for guests.  Makes a GREAT drink mixed because it tastes like you just freshly muddled the mint into the drink.  And it's still fun to see someone add a glowing ingredient to the drink even if it doesn't stay glowing.\nPhotoandGrime: Sounds cool :)! I made UV reactive edible oil with chlorophyll once; specifically chlorella supplements. You can use spirulina as well, but personally I really dislike the smell and taste of spirulina so I used chlorella. I used it as edible face paint, in recipes (pink/red buttercream), but also in a drink (http://i.imgur.com/dHyuyfR.gifv). I put a little bit of it in milk, and since it's an oil, it floats. Because milk has a lot of fat in it, the colour doesn't dissolve. And actually, it's not bad at all to drink (especially if you sweeten the milk or make a mix drink). Sure, you get a bit of an oily taste, but it's not like you're drinking a whole glass of oil hehe. It's nice to 'meet' a fellow glow food appreciator haha! You know what I really find annoying about all UV reactive ingredients? They are either pretty bitter or a pain in the ass to extract (chlorophyll). You'd think with their glow effect in ultraviolet light, they would be sweet as well, but vitamin B2, Quinine and turmeric all don't taste too well without being mixed with other (sweet) ingredients. ;P\n", "prompt": "PhotoandGrime: Edible UV glow lightsaber\n\njagedlion: Use a little bit of vitamin B2: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F7URNTE\n\nYou can make a bright yellow green one.

{"full_text": "YardLongKingKongDong: YSK: Dissociation is not the same as day-dreaming.\nWhy YSK: First off, dissociation is often a symptom of a much larger ongoing problem. It could be severe unresolved trauma, it could be an anxiety response, or it could be a depression symptom. It could be all three at once. Misusing these terms leads to a lot of confusion and anxiety for people who may think that they have a serious psychiatric disorder. Obviously, avoiding that confusion is good. \n\nIf someone tells you that a professional has diagnosed them with dissociation, that doesn't mean they're just day-dreaming in their head. It means they might experience the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Have an out-of-body experience\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Feel like you are a different person sometimes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Feel like your heart is pounding or you're light-headed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Feel emotionally numb or detached\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Feel little or no pain\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther symptoms you can get are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Have an altered sense of time\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Not remember how you got somewhere\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Have tunnel vision\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Hear voices in your head\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Have intense flashbacks that feel real\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Become immobile\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Get absorbed in a fantasy world that seems real\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is all from WebMD. \n\n [https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/dissociation-overview](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/dissociation-overview) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, I've seen a lot of younger people who are learning this term for the first time confuse it with normal, inattentive daydreaming. You won't always be \"present\" in your everyday life. Your mind wanders. Your eyes glaze over. You're not paying attention to anything in particular. This sort of behavior is NOT dissociation. It's sorta how \"gas-lighting\" has replaced the word \"lying\" for some people, even though they're very different things. Throwing around these psychiatric terms without really understanding the severity and nuances associated with them leads to a lot of misuse and improper self-diagnosis.\nUntap_Phased: Actually, daydreaming is a mild form of dissociation. Dissociation is not inherently \u201cneurotic,\u201d but only becomes so when it interferes with your functioning. All human beings dissociate and we need to escape reality like that sometimes as a coping mechanism. Although it is true PTSD and depression do cause exacerbated/extreme dissociation on a clinical level.\nYardLongKingKongDong: This is clearly not what was meant with a very clinical, textbook definition provided for dissociation.\nUntap_Phased: It is likely that the clinical definition refers specifically to clinical dissociation proper and not the broader term of \u201cdissociation.\u201d The vast majority of instances of dissociation are not diagnosed because they don\u2019t interfere with one\u2019s functioning - otherwise they\u2019d be hospitalizing everyone who went to a movie theater. I\u2019m a mental health professional who has worked with people with severe trauma, anxiety and depression so I am informed on the subject.

Since we can't define Mathematics within Mathematics, such a Metamaths represents a meta-creating space or awareness/consciousness which envelopes/contains a smaller/less-complex formal system (kind of like a Russian doll).\n\nSo following this logic, either there may be an infinite series of this kind of encapsulation or there's at least one encapsulation which holds the infinite while also remaining part of that infinite.\n\nHis claim regarding the *tools of Creation* had me thinking that such the recursion, inward or outward was infinite, but my position is that it doesn't have to be, as the Id is contained by the Ego and then both are contained within the Super Ego, but the Super Ego may only be infinitie possibility which the Ego then draws and manifests from (like Tesla's infinitie storehouse).\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I can't stop thinking about it!\njsticebeaver: this is the wrong lesson to take from godel's theorems.\n\nwhen viewed in historical context, like many other logicians and mathematicians godel was working on problems that david hilbert had put forth at the turn of the century. hilbert had hoped there could be a single system of proof such that a statement in mathematics was true if and only if it could be proven under that system.\n\nwhat godel did was demonstrate how for any possible system of proof, applied to any possible set of axioms, it was possible to construct a statement which was not provable (derivable by the rules of inference of the system) under that system, but which was intuitively true nonetheless, and provable under a different system (the construction godel follows in his theorem), he basically killed the idea of an absolute method of proof that could attain for us humans absolutely certain mathematical truth.\n\nhilbert's hope for a system of proof that would place mathematical truth in a pedestal of certainty above all other kinds of truth was pretty much given up from then on. you still hear professional mathematicians and popularizers speak of \"mathematical certainty\", but those are people who have not yet learned this lesson.\nGoldenrule-er: Cool. But no thoughts on my actual prompt? I understand you feel it's the \"wrong\" lesson to take from G\u00f6del's work on the Incompleteness Theorems, but say you were open to taking any lessons from anything, what then about what I've postulated in the initial comment? Thanks for you time!\njsticebeaver: I think what you wrote is wrong, but mainly it's not understandable\nGoldenrule-er: Can you share where you cease to follow? Like, where you begin to fail understanding? I might be able to reword/clarify/simplify. \ud83e\udd19\njsticebeaver: first you're speaking of mathematics and systems of deductive proof, then you go to Godel's conclusions about the limits of proof, and then you start a non-sequitor about a metamathematics that's a \"space of awareness\" and so on. I don't know what Godel's theorem has to do with a metamathematics that is a space of awareness\nGoldenrule-er: I see how that could be seen as a non sequitur. I suppose that, since mathematics is our most effective language for describing the world (it survives to describe when other languages fail) that the metamath(s) which can fully define our math(s) would represent a containing source, conceptually speaking. \n\nLike you can't have math if there wasn't also somewhere the thing which allows for it. You can't program in python if the base code didn't allow for the required entry. Maybe that's not the best example, as I'm not a programmer. You can't run \"OregonTrail.exe\" without first having what allows it to exist: the containing system of say MS-DOS. This type of relationship.  Oregon trail.exe cannot operate MS-DOS, but it can be operated within/by MS Dos.\n\nI intended to drive that connection home by referencing the Russian doll and how the id may be said to be contained by the ego and both of these may be contained by the super ego. I suppose I could've been more clear. Thanks for letting me know.\njsticebeaver: I disagree with you, in regards to the what mathematics is I'm a platonist or something. I think there's mathematical objects out there that aren't just thoughts in the minds of mathematicians, or structures present in mathematical languages, but that are objective and have objective features. Mathematics is the study of the necessary features of those objects, but like all studies of objective features of reality, there is no sense in which we can ever achieve complete truth and knowledge, so there isn't a thing such as a mathematics that is perfect and encapsulates our own mathematics. If there is such a thing, it's for the gods to know about, not us.\nGoldenrule-er: You are agreeing with me though. That's why I initially referred to such a *providing Mathematics* as that meta maths would be as the \"tools of Creation\". Your belief in the Ideal cannot be believed in if what we have here isn't a lesser Form of that Ideal. See what I mean, here? You're agreeing that this happens to be the case. Of there are qualitative differences, there must be qualitative levels (Russian doll again [where greater size allows for greater information/detail]). \n\nWho must have the ability to wield a meta mathematics if not meta-level beings? Everything that I've pointed to as far as awareness growing from the id to the ego and (although not for many of us) from the ego to the super ego suggests a processional capability for progressive growth of ability. Not for all, but for those who remain learning selves, anyway. It's not crazy to see such a design unfolding in this manner. What have we done since the digital revolution, but make ever-more realistic virtual spaces and immersive games? As above, so below. My curiosity is in this design as an infinite progression/recursion or instead there being some sort of Max Level. A Super-super ego and so on forever or the super ego as infinite nexus? Any thoughts on this?\njsticebeaver: Here's where I disagree but might seem to agree - that such a being can exist and meaningfully affect the world we live. I don't think this is the case, I think the claim that a supernatural being exists that knows the entirety of mathematics and has absolute knowledge of mathematics, is logically equivalent to a belief in the Greek or Roman gods. It's a form of the belief in supernatural limits to what we can know - supernatural because there are beings that can know beyond that limit, and if they shared it with us we could know it too.\nGoldenrule-er: I hear what you're saying and agree with you as far as it appears exactly the same as Greek or Roman beliefs in various patron gods of song and dance or the sea or fertility etc. Today we'd consider such beliefs as passing and nonsense. \n\nToday also, however, we design virtual worlds where people immerse their psyches and entertain the willing suspension of disbelief. Just because a programmer knows and writes in a language of which I know nothing about doesn't change the fact that I can treat what's before my eyes in a virtual reality simulation as real to me in that moment. This is the point I'm speaking to. The same relationship would apply to knowledge of a meta mathematics. \n\nThat programmer is levels above me in knowledge of a particular area, so by extension it's not unfeasible to believe that there are such levels of *capability* for learning, maintaining and employing levels of knowledge. \n\nWe have Holy books from the times of the Greeks and Romans that speak directly to godly design employment and communication from a meta level. Our oldest traditions such as Hinduism speak directly to a panpsychist design of our known reality which suggests the very same truth as our own individual progressing from id to ego to super ego: that for the psyche, there are varying levels of awareness of the same thing and varying levels of awareness may incorporate corresponding levels of ability to exercise   such awareness. \n\nWe see this is the various forms of mastery we see today in our daily life. NHL goalies have superhuman response times-- through familiarity and practice. People who practice a specialty better and more than others achieve greater levels of ability in such specialties. Whether a \"Rock God\" guitarist or a Olympic gymnast or a Hollywood Director, these show levels of achievement aren't limited as we continue to set new records in all of these areas within this space. \n\nMaths limit our ability to perform such feats within this space, but our own ability to outperform previous limits shows a mind component that could connect to limitless expansion toward Plato's World of Forms in the following way:\n\n There may be infinite numbers/values between 0 and 1. Perhaps 1 is that WoFs and they design everything between 0 and 1 as an encapsulated space designed-experientially in mathematics, for our experience, from the WoFs space of Meta-maths. Sure it's a long shot, but it does correspond to how we design and initiate encapsulated systems here, so it may not, in truth, be so nonsensical at all. \n\nThanks for your time, I know this was long.\njsticebeaver: &gt; The same relationship would apply to knowledge of a meta mathematics. \n\nNo, because a programmer programs a computer, which is a physical object, and the knowledge required to do that is conjectured explanations - not the kind of perfect knowledge the entity you posit possesses.\nGoldenrule-er: That is correct. I am attempting to show the physical relationship we have to define a virtual/perceptual/experiential space performs the same functional-relationship as a metaphysical to physical interactional/programming/design relationship might.  \n\nSomeone who is pure id cannot access the knowledge of the self awareness of the ego. Someone enslaved by their ego cannot know the experience of one who has risen above the tyranny of the ego and so has come to employ the ego for its own purposes. \n\nUnderstanding that the limitations of the beings we posit/embody may shift and change in such fashions as we incorporate greater forms of knowledge/learning is intended to portray the same functional-relationship a meta being would have with meta maths in comparison to our human being with *regular/standard maths*. \n\nThe id cannot comprehend the ego. The ego comprehends (encapsulates) the I'd, and may entertain the idea of the superego, but cannot comprehend (encapsulate) the super ego. The transcendence of these boundaries is made by the psyche. If we can go up in awareness and design for lesser levels of awareness (the influence or creation for egos and ids for example), why would it seem spurious that *they/meta beings* could not be doing the same for us?\n\nI realize that it's only obvious that we'd suggest our idea of any *higher plain of experience* must reflect that of what the design we inhabit suggests to us, but it does stand to reason, doesn't it?\n\nAlso, the computer is a physical object, but the information it operates with and shows upon the screen is *virtual* or conceptual. The rules and syntax of computer language is programmed systems that output information by the input of information. The abacus is physical, the digital computer works with physical transfers of electrons in the form of electricity to yield electronic outputs we then *virtually* read as a translation of physical input for *experiential value/virtual output* The one or zero of binary is *seen* as a physical \"one of zero\", but only in that a screen *displays* a one or a zero. We have not yet determined a physical nature for information (and may one day understand information as metaphysical [that part of the formal system which cannot be fully defined with that system, as G\u00f6del has shown us with the Incompleteness Theorems]).\njsticebeaver: First of all I just want to make clear that our knowledge of mathematics evolves. Mathematicians today know theorems and are able to produce proofs that mathematicians just 200 years ago didn't know how to. They understand what a proof is, what criteria proofs must meet to be accepted by the community, better than mathematicians did before. More than that, some things mathematicians thought before, are now known to be mistaken (case in point the universal system of proof that Godel showed was impossible).\n\nSo mathematics isn't what mathematicians think is true about numbers and sets and so on. Mathematicians have no authority over what mathematics is, they are just the people that in any given culture, generations and so on study mathematics. When the beliefs of mathematicians change regarding what's true and what is not in mathematics, those changes carry no authority and the matter of the truth or falsity of those beliefs remains unchanged, it's an objective property independent of who holds the beliefs, be it a studied professor or a graduate student.\n\nIt's not like you can define mathematics as the body of beliefs about numbers that mathematicians have, and then you define a superset of that which is comprised of all the abstract real true beliefs about numbers that only a supernatural being could have and be aware of.\nGoldenrule-er: I believe I hear you. This is indeed a topic regarding the philosophy of Mathematics rather than Mathematics itself. Of course beliefs don't change the happenstance of veracity or falsehood regarding proofs etc. No one is claiming such a super set as a *true belief*. I'm trying to say that G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems appear to point to the necessity of such an enveloping/containing source-- as no formal system may be completely defined within its own system. It appears to be the case if his proofs are proofs, right? Unless maybe it's just pure intuitional pulling from the infinite (as we have with all creative endeavors which have come from ideas).\n\nSo it would appear that Mathematics itself/physics itself, having no findable foundations as proven by G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems, also means there are no findable foundations *without the introduction of a meta-maths*. If this were to be true (and it may indeed be impossible to know this unless perhaps in dreamspace or something of the like) then such a meta-maths would literally represent \"the tools of Creation\". That the meta-maths contains or Martha would then make any user/programmer/metamathematician supernatural, in the true sense of the word, *to us*. \n\nSo what I trying to say here? No trouble with truth and falsity, only a logical playout. It is also always possible there is an entirely separate factual/actual logical playout(s) for which we have not accessed any knowledge of yet whatsoever, but it happens to be the case and always has been since our maths were discovered/created within the metamaths. \n\nThat said, I also like the bottom up idea where we make the higher forms from the lesser. As in the case of binary birthing so many forms of evolved programming languages, yet this route is moot given that zero and one fall within our accessible maths and so the metamaths provider becomes necessary once again as the Incompleteness Theorems appear to call for a meta-maths as necessary, you know?\njsticebeaver: &gt; No one is claiming such a super set as a true belief. I'm trying to say that G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems appear to point to the necessity of such an enveloping/containing source\n\nNo, the exact opposite is true, Godel's construction shows that such an enveloping/containing source is impossible. Godel doesn't show or suggest what the nature of mathematics is, instead he proves that the nature of mathematics IS NOT that there exists an all enveloping container which holds all mathematical systems that cannot by themselves be consistent and complete.\n\nHe shows there cannot be such a necessity as an enveloping source for all mathematics known to man. That source was believed to be necessary before Godel's work, and Godel became iconic for showing that intuition was false, and that not only there was no such necessity, but that there couldn't possibly be.\n\n&gt; So it would appear that Mathematics itself/physics itself, having no findable foundations as proven by G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems, also means there are no findable foundations without the introduction of a meta-maths. If this were to be true (and it may indeed be impossible to know this unless perhaps in dreamspace or something of the like) then such a meta-maths would literally represent \"the tools of Creation\". That the meta-maths contains or Martha would then make any user/programmer/metamathematician supernatural, in the true sense of the word, to us. \n\nThis meta-maths doesn't exist. Show me an example of it. For example, I could show you Godel's theorem and it would be an example of mathematics as we know it. But you couldn't show me an example of that meta-maths, because it doesn't exist. If it did exist, then you could show me. But you can't.\nGoldenrule-er: On the first point you've just basically misunderstood the ramifications of the Incompleteness Theorems and there nothing In aware of that I can do to help you with that here.\n\nOn the second point you're fundamentally missing out on the fact that such a metamaths cannot be shown *here*. In effect, you're saying \"if the whole world exists outside of my house how come you can't prove it by bringing it inside my house?\" The world cannot fit in your house. Your house is dependant on the whole world, not the other way around.\njsticebeaver: I have not. You're making a baseless speculation in my eyes, where you are attempting to save the pre-Godelian idea that mathematics can be put on a solid foundation from which all mathematical truths can be deduced, an all containing source. Godel showed this idea was mistaken. Upon Godel's refutation of this idea, you are reimagining the kind of secure source of all mathematics in a way that maybe his predecessor hadn't thought of, but you are still making the same mistake that Godel unveiled.\nGoldenrule-er: Thank you for clarifying. What I'm trying to communicate is that what G\u00f6del unveiled is that it's impossible to *bring the world into the house* so there's indeed no finding or bringing such Metamechanics here as they do not write in a language which may be shown in our programming language (regular/*our* maths) so to speak. Given he showed there's always a backdoor to a larger system which then fully defines the smaller system, so it it is that he's not proving that the meta-maths don't exist, but that they cannot exist here. Just as physics may show us the conceptual understandings of 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on dimensions, so can this suggestion/logical-deduction be entertained/imagined as a possibility realizable *somewhere else* while also not being realized within *our* shared space.\njsticebeaver: I don't think it can, not in the sense of it being a problem of understanding that you can make progress in, since by definition that thing is not realized in our physical reality, where only a small proportion of all mathematical truths can be understood and known by us.\n\nBy your explanation, any kind of variant of a metamechanics as the one you have in mind is \"impossible to bring the world into the house\", and that \"there is indeed no finding or bringing such Metamechanics here\". The case for us coming to know and understand a Methamechanics of this kind is a case of a proposition which we do know can never be known, by any means, as long as we're humans in the physical world, which you agree is the case.\n\nSo all ideas of what that thing is, all arguments made about that thing and why it matters, including yours, all those would be arbitrary and eventually uninteresting to the people involved. To the point, nowadays that's out of fashion. It was in fashion maybe up until Bertrand Russel.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also true that the mathematics we know today is going to look like kid play for people in thousands of years, but that advance will not be made in a single discovery, it will happen gradually as people conquer more paroquial problems, and from solving some of those, answers with larger reach will shape the growth of knowledge. For us to understand that it would be like if some of the earliest homo sapiens to have ever existed somehow appeared fully conscious and alive in Times Square this afternoon. They would be left without comprehension and wouldn't be able to understand what they were seeing and experiencing.\n", "prompt": "BernardJOrtcutt: /r/philosophy Open Discussion Thread | March 21, 2022\nWelcome to this week's Open Discussion Thread.

Maybe we're finally realizing that we're not robots or machines and that we do have needs that are not met by holding ourselves to those standards.\nyakushi12345: I think the claim relating this to a market economy standard isn't precise.  This is only inefficient if you presuppose that the goal of your life is to generate as much economic activity as possible; regardless of what the system you live in is.\nWoollyManmoth: Maybe I'm not as careful with my words as I should be, but by market economy I'm thinking of competition to produce profits. This system is conducive to life-consuming busyness when we consider that any person can only access the means of life through by participating in the labor market and that most people find esteem in the work that they do. \nMELBOT87: &gt;This system is conducive to life-consuming busyness when we consider that any person can only access the means of life through by participating in the labor market and that most people find esteem in the work that they do.\n\nThe market is merely a process by which individuals make choices regarding their own lives. Some people choose professions that make lots of money, like doctors or investment bankers, whereas others choose jobs that make less money but provide alternative benefits like more time with family.\n\nYour characterization of the market is a fallacy. It is merely a process whereby people can express their choices any way they want. Your fallacy is most popular when discussing economic inequality - a great amount of which can be explained by people's choices.\nWoollyManmoth: Your characterization of my position is a fallacy. The fact that you conflated a market and an economy says all too much. Markets have almost always existed, and they do let us express certain choices and obtain certain means of subsistence. However, only very recently has the market been the sole principle of production and distribution for an entire society. In this way, the market as we know it is not as much of an opportunity as much as it is an *imperative* - it is the mediator to all of our means of subsistence. And we participate in the market economy through competing in the labor market. Every individual must be involved in the competition for the means to subsistence. If you find esteem in doing well or obtaining things, this can keep you frightfully busy. This situation is unknown in previous economies, and imposes new limits on people's freedoms.\n\nYour fallacy is most common with people who are foregin to the study of certain histories or suffer from a teleological bias - a great amount of which can be explained by people's inability to tell which parts of their worldview they've merely inherited and/or are biased. \nMELBOT87: &gt;The fact that you conflated a market and an economy says all too much.\n\nI said specifically that market is a process. I did not conflate it with an economy. The market is the process by which people make economic decisions.\n\n&gt;However, only very recently has the market been the sole principle of production and distribution for an entire society.\n\nUh no. It is just that economic factors can be quantified whereas non-economic factors cannot. There isn't a way to quantify time spent with your family or playing video games versus earning income. It is only revealed through the actual choices people make. \n\n&gt;In this way, the market as we know it is not as much of an opportunity as much as it is an imperative - it is the mediator to all of our means of subsistence.\n\nAs opposed to *what*? Finished goods falling from the sky? Using our imagination? The market provides incentives for people to actually produce. Absent those incentives, then people will not take entrepreneurial risk and they will not produce. That is the purpose of the profit motive.\n\n&gt;Every individual must be involved in the competition for the means to subsistence.\n\nlol again - as opposed to *what*? Getting shit for free?\n\n&gt;This situation is unknown in previous economies, and imposes new limits on people's freedoms.\n\nWhat utter nonsense. Previous economies suffered from a lack of capital and technology. 98% of the population worked on subsistence farming before the industrial revolution. Are you saying people were \"free\" when they had to work on a farm and hope for a good harvest?\n\n\nWoollyManmoth: &gt;Uh no. It is just that economic factors can be quantified\n\nPrevious economies operated on a different logic. Communities of various sorts produced for use and various hierarchical systems and social relations dictated how goods were redistributed. Markets existed, but only as fragemented forms of trading opportunities between communities, most of which sustained themselves, or for luxuries if you're pretty wealthy. The current logic is different; each individual must make profit via the market.\n\n&gt;As opposed to what?\n\nProduction for use as opposed to production for profit, but that's the only one I know.\n\n&gt;Absent those incentives, then people will not take entrepreneurial risk \n\n[Some will disagree](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)  The profit icentive is an invention, and we produced alright for a long time before that. It's in place now perhaps because the social framework we're born into gives us almost no alternative.\n\n&gt;Previous economies suffered from a lack of capital and technology.\n\nAssuming that the present situation was the end goal of previous economies and its history is only the overcoming of obstacles is to impose a teleology on the past. Are you a creationist by chance? There were economies more commercially developed and technologically capable than England before the Industrial Revolution began, but these economies not develop the market economy we know. \n\n&gt;Are you saying people were \"free\"\n\nNo one's really free. We all accept certain goods at the acceptance of certain limitations, but I'm not making the argument that the past was superior either.\nMELBOT87: &gt;Previous economies operated on a different logic.\n\nA logic dictated by tremendous scarcity and poverty. Through markets, efficiencies created abundance. \n\n&gt;Communities of various sorts produced for use and various hierarchical systems and social relations dictated how goods were redistributed.\n\nUsually through violent feudal systems that provided for the rich at the expense of everyone else.\n\n&gt;The current logic is different; each individual must make profit via the market.\n\nWhich makes sense when everyone has economic and political liberty and make decisions regarding their own lives. \n\n&gt;Some will disagree\n\nIf people disagree than they can operate in that manner without depriving others of operating under a different incentive structure. That is what freedom and markets are about. If you want to farm tomatoes and that is all that you want to do in life and that is all that will make you happy - you are free to do it. If I prefer to be a lawyer and try to make more money, than that is my choice and I am free to do it. As long as you do not infringe on my right to pursue my interests and I don't infringe on your right to pursue your interests - then we can live harmoniously.\n\n&gt;The profit icentive is an invention, and we produced alright for a long time before that.\n\nIt is not an invention - it is quite natural. People respond to incentives. Profit is one form of incentive. What profits actually are are signals. They signal that sum of the resources used is greater than the cost of securing those individual resources. It sends a signal that someone is using resources in a way that people demand. A loss, as a corollary, signals that people are using resources wastefully - that the economic costs are greater than the value created.\n\n&gt;It's in place now perhaps because the social framework we're born into gives us almost no alternative.\n\nBut you are free to operate outside of that if you want. It hasn't always  worked this way as you stated above. It works that way now because people like to have abundant food and electricity and the such. For people who prefer not to have those things, they can find a different system.\n\n&gt;Assuming that the present situation was the end goal of previous economies and its history is only the overcoming of obstacles is to impose a teleology on the past.\n\nA valid assumption. People want food. People want electricity. People want homes. People want cars. Know how I know this? Because when given the choice, many people choose it. It is revealed through their actions. Not everyone wants this. There is a small few who don't. But that doesn't change the fact that a great majority of people prefer abundance to poverty.\n\n&gt;Are you a creationist by chance?\n\nFar from it.\n\n&gt;There were economies more commercially developed and technologically capable than England before the Industrial Revolution began, but these economies not develop the market economy we know.\n\nSo? Economies were mercantilist and imperialist. Their economic power came from domination of both resources and people. Once industry increased production, the average person could enjoy the luxuries.\nWoollyManmoth: It's not true that the evolution from pre-market economies to market economies is a matter of having abundant goods.\nMELBOT87: No - it is a *consequence*. You may know a lot of philosophy, but you don't know a whole lot about economics. The industrial revolution led to the greatest increase in real wages and standard of living in human history. It came about because capital made labor more productive. Increased agricultural production meant that less people needed to farm to feed the populace (at one point 98% of the population were in agriculture - now 2% feed the other 98%). This freed up labor for industrial work which allowed for the mass production of goods. Simple items we take for granted like clothes, furniture, heat became abundant and available to the common person because of these principles. Because individuals sought profit. \n\nProfitable enterprises signal to the market that resources are being used wisely. It signals investors to invest more capital in that industry and it entices entrepreneurs to enter into the industry to compete and capture those profits. Then, through competition quality goes up and prices come down. \n\nThe market is merely the process by which individuals make economic decisions regarding what goods or services they prefer relative to all the other goods and services available. That is why government interventions in the market often fail to produce desired results. Because government policy cannot change reality, it can only alter incentives. But politicians and bureaucrats cannot anticipate all of the unintended consequences of their actions. For instance, price controls lead to shortages. They set the price below where supply and demand intersect and it causes the product to be priced below its actual market value. It also destroys the incentive to produce more in order to capture higher profits.\nWoollyManmoth: So your stance is that the transition from pre-market economy to market economy is a matter of increased productivity through technology, or at least primarily technology? And this increased productivity overcame the obstacles necessary to obtain a market economy, which is the natural progression for any economy with the resources to do so?

{"full_text": "[deleted]: Will dumbell OHP improves my pike-push ups ?\nHello, i have a question. I train calisthenics like 3 months now, im bigger, stronger. I never trained pike-push ups (as progression to handstand etc.) always did just dips, push-ups and my shoulders grow even with just those 2 exercises, but they are not stronger.\n\nIm extremely weak for shoulder pressing, so my max are like 1-2 pike push-ups with correct technique when im fresh, but if i add it to my training routine, especially after push-ups/dips i cant do even 1. I have some bands and light dumbells so i was thinking about doing dumbell overhed press for classic 6-12 rep range until i gain strenght to be able to do some pike-push ups in my routine.\n\nI have just question, i know both are shoulder pressing movements, but do you think that dumbell pressing will improve my pike-push ups, or its something different and even with progress on dumbells, i wont be able to do more pikes ? Thanks\nMindfulMover: &gt;I have just question, i know both are shoulder pressing movements, but do you think that dumbell pressing will improve my pike-push ups\n\nProbably not THAT much. In fact, I think the carryover is better the other way around. What I would do is this...\n\n&gt; are like 1-2 pike push-ups with correct technique when im fresh\n\n...At the BEGINNING of your workout and that should work better! Try a few sets of one.  Another thing I would do is remember that you can use a version with your KNEES on an elevated surface and your HANDS on the ground/blocks/paralletes to reduce the intensity of the Pike Pushup until you're stronger.\njustjr112: This is false. \n\nDumbbell pressing will carryover to pike pressing ability. \n\nShow me someone who can ohp 60% of their bodyweight and I'll show you show you someone who can rep out pike push ups. ( Bodyweight being relative) \n\nI'd say a Pike push up is sub 50 percent of your bodyweight so working up to 50 percent of you your bodyweight with dumbbell or barbell pressing is a good way to increase pike pressing. \n\n\nI'd do something like\n\nPike push ups 2 x failure \nDumbbell presses 2-5 x 10 \nClose grip push ups 2 x failure\nMindfulMover: &gt;Dumbbell pressing will carryover to pike pressing ability.\n\nI'm not saying there is ZERO carryover. Just not that much. Not enough to bother with it. I'd go with the Knee Piked Pushup route. It's more specific and it will improve both the HSPU and the DB OHP too. :D\njustjr112: Don't talk in absolutes if you are basing your arguments on personal experiences. \n\nDumbbell pressing in my opinion will benefit pipe push-ups handstand push-ups and military person just as much as the others why because it's the same muscles. Progressive overload is real and you can microload better with dumbbells then you can with making 15 to 35% jumps with calisthenics. \n\nThe correct answer is do both\nMindfulMover: &gt;Don't talk in absolutes if you are basing your arguments on personal experiences.\n\n&gt;Probably not THAT much.\n\nCan you show me where the absolute is there? ;D\n\n&gt;Dumbbell pressing in my opinion will benefit pipe push-ups handstand push-ups and military person just as much as the others why because it's the same muscles.\n\nI doubt this. \n\n&gt;The correct answer is do both\n\nWhy? You could just do the Pike Pushups which are more specific and gain on that PLUS the DB OHP. If you can come up with a better reason, I'm open to hearing it. But the idea that you can't make small adjustments with calisthenics is incorrect. In fact, you can make BETTER adjustments with Calisthenics. You can go DOWN in a Pike and UP on the knees! So I'd say that's another plus for Pike PU over DB OHP. \n\nIf you get another reason, I'm open to hearing it.\njustjr112: I've already given the reason. \n\nMicro loading. \n\nNote these numbers are examples: \n\nPike push up down 50 percent - down on knees 25 percent. \n\nSay your max dumbbell press is 25 pounds for 10 next set do 20 for 10 again. The drop isn't 25 percent closer to 10. Which means volume and intensity are better managed. \n\nAgain you can do one or the other but why limited one self if there's no actual reason not to?\nMindfulMover: &gt;Note these numbers are examples:Pike push up down 50 percent - down on knees 25 percent.\n\nIt's not a solid example though because remember, we can adjust the load of the Pike Pushup mid rep by shifting how much load we have on our hands. So it could be a MUCH bigger variety. In fact, I can go down with most of my weight on my hands at the top, less near the bottom, and come up on the knees with some weight on the hands then as much as I can on the top. You can adjust the load much better!\n\n&gt;Say your max dumbbell press is 25 pounds for 10 next set do 20 for 10 again. The drop isn't 25 percent closer to 10. Which means volume and intensity are better managed.\n\nThe above example shows how you can do this with even more variety with the Pike Pushup so if you're giving this as an advantage of DB OHP, it would apply to both.\n\n&gt;Again you can do one or the other but why limited one self if there's no actual reason not to?\n\nI gave the reason: The Pike Pushup is more specific and will have more carryover to the Pike Pushup than DB OHP. No point in using less useful tool.\njustjr112: Or you can use the dumbbells and not have to do all the Hocus pocus * shrugs \n\nLess useful as defined by YOU and nothing else.\nMindfulMover: SAID principle would define them as less useful. Just like if OPs goal was the highest DB OHP, then Pike Pushup would be less useful.\njustjr112: Pike push ups DO help ohp. Because they are both ohps. There's a ton of anecdotal evidence from guys like alpha destiny ,Louis Simmons and westside barbell. Over 40 years worth. Exercise variation isn't \" less useful\"\nMindfulMover: &gt; Exercise variation isn't \" less useful\"\n\nIf my goal is to Squat 500 pounds, what do you think is going to be MORE useful... Leg Extensions? Or Squats?\njustjr112: The answer is it depends. \n\n*Box squats, *hack squats * pause squats and yes leg extensions if you have a weakness in the lock out position or if you need extra volume without the drain on your cns. \n\nMilitary press, handstand push ups, dumbbell presses pike pushups are all similar variations and all have carry over to one another. Conjugate method works as proven by 100s of athletes If you don't want to use it that's fine but dismissing it as not not effective is wrong.\nMindfulMover: You still didn't answer which is going to be MORE useful. Do you think Squats and Leg Extensions are going to be equally useful if the goal is obtaining at 500 pound squat?\njustjr112: I did answer, you just didn't like it. \n\nI said it depends on the situation. Obviously you need to squat but at a certain point just squatting more will do more hard then good see overuse injuries.  Leg extensions can help particularly in the muscle building portion as well as strengthening the teardrop muscle which does a lot of the heavy lifting once your knee angle hits the 90\u00b0 angle. \n\nAgain in this example what does this person need, it's lazy to assume he needs more squatting. Is his form bad,  is he squatting high bar low bar? Is he losing strength in certain parts of the movement etc. Context matters.\n\nYou can increase tut and slow down the knee pike pu to increase intensity or you can switch out the 15s for the 20 Pound dumbbells . \n\nLet's spot pretending that like like push ups are Olympic lifts and pushing brands/dogma. Pike push ups are low on the skill level and require more over all strength. Get stronger however you want and pikes will be easier to do.\nMindfulMover: I think most people would agree the bulk of the gains are going to come from the Squat. If you think Leg Extensions and Squats are going to give the same amount of gain towards the goal of Squatting 500 pounds... then I'm not sure what to say to that except we will have to agree to disagree and hope you have good training! :D\njustjr112: Your not listening.... There's nothing more disheartening then trying to have an intelligent conversation then having someone with try to strawman you or pick out parts without context...

Rather than having two separate ropes, one for each bar, mine uses a singular one shared between the two.\n\nThis creates additional instability and a greater need to balance, and fixes the leveling/adjusting problem. It's also easier to hang. On the down side it might not provide enough distance between the bars depending on what you hang it against. Economically it eliminates the need for the quick link, which is nice.\n\nOther than that, yeah, I did more or less the same thing this guy did.

{"full_text": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello! I am trying to install a water softener in our basement, in the utility room next to our water heater. I have a couple of questions before cutting into the plumbing. I created a diagram and included a picture below. You can access the diagram here and make edits if you'd like to help me confirm plumbing layout. [https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/3335eea1-83f3-405f-be58-b6f7563cd66b](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/3335eea1-83f3-405f-be58-b6f7563cd66b)\n\nMy questions are-\n\n1. There are a couple of branches off the main water line to our bathroom and kitchen before it reaches the water heater/utility room. I've read you want to install the softener right next to the main entry point for the water. This is not possible in my house so what is the next best thing?  \n2. I would want to leave our drinking water and outside spigots off the softener, so those would have to be looped out?\n3. Is it ok to just install the softener before the heater and not soften the cold water going to our bathroom/kitchen? or would it be stupid to do that and should I just soften the whole house?\n4. What is the ideal way to plumb to this softener based on the diagram below? Maybe I am just overcomplicating this.\n\nI feel good about doing the actual work, I would really like to confirm i am doing it the right way before i go through with it though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r8cp95lmxq41.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c553b8a676c855b82224eefb2905259b0a87ef1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idqc02ajmxq41.jpg?width=1724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec264596d6cd6c8feb6e6bdb6c9fac134d18805e\nTobyChan: I\u2019m in the UK so take what I say with a pinch of salt (did you see what I did there?)\n\nOver here it\u2019s normal to soften the water for the whole house expect you must leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap.  I would also leave any outdoor taps unsoftened so that you can water plants with untreated water.\nGrimResistance: &gt; leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap\n\nWhy is this?\nTobyChan: So you\u2019re not drinking and cooking with salty water\njohnwayne2413: Soft water is perfectly okay to drink.  I ran the numbers.\n\nTypically, water softeners add 46 mg/ liter of sodium for every 100 mg/liter of hardness minerals present in the water.\n\nThe grain per gallon (gpg) is a unit of water hardness defined as 1 grain (64.8 milligrams) of calcium carbonate dissolved in 1 US gallon of water (3.785412 L)\n\nThat works out to 17.11834802 mg calcium carbonate per liter of water.\n\nMy water is 18 grains hardness (which is very hard) so:\n\n    18 * 17.11834802 mg = 308.1302644 mg\n\nThe softener will add 141.7399216 mg sodium to 1 Liter of water (\\~34 ounces).\n\n    46 mg/L Na / 100 mg/L CaCO\u2083 = x / 308.1302644 mg CaCO\u2083\n    100x = 14,173.99 mg/L Na\n    x = 141.7399216 mg/L Na\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day\u2014that's equal to about 1 teaspoon of table salt!\n\nThis is how much water you would have to drink per day to exceed your salt intake:\n\n    (2,300 mg / 141.7399216 mg) * 34 ounces = 551 ounces of water per day\n\nIf you drank that much water in a day, ironically, you would die from hyponatremia (dilution of sodium in your blood) before you died from hypertension.\n\nTest your water hardness with a proper kit, the dropper kind, not the strips.  If your water is less hard than 18 grains then your safety margin is even higher.\n\nMost people should worry about eating potato chips or french fries adding too much salt to their body than drinking softened water.\nTobyChan: Again\u2026 read my caveat, I\u2019m from the UK and we have a limit on the sodium content on potable water supply.  Also, you have to appreciate that hardness is a relative term.  I\u2019ve seen borehole supplies that have been softened to the limit which still remain very hard.  If an untreated supply to the kitchen was added they could have softened the water further and actually got some benefit from the treatment!\n", "prompt": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello!

More specifically, it's the Verizon Prepaid 3G Moto G 1st Generation. \napplesjgtl: My bad, no context in my inbox on my phone.

I can't speak to data about officers in multiple shootings, but I'd think we'd hear more from the media about individuals and general stats on this. The challenge with the proposition are the possible loop holes. Want to retire early? Shoot someone who you can claim looked like was pulling a gun on you. Are you a gang who needs a cop of the street? Put then in a situation requiring force. Maybe the benefits would out weigh misuses, maybe not.\n\n2) Being more like the UK with possibly less gun related crime would be nice, but there's more than one personal firearm per American citizen in the US. To try reaching that ideal, a number of things would need to happen, such as people would need to be disarmed before you could think of disarming US cops. This also grows the arms black market. Bearing arms is a constitutional right, one that would not be given up without a civil war.\ncavehobbit: 1) so far as media reports, I can only say I have seen that kind of analysis posted on reddit,  on a phone now so find it is difficult. So far as retiring early, you get nothing if you are convicted of a crime, so that is incentive to be careful. I do not know how the UK handles vulnerability of their officers to attack, but it seems to work there.\n\n2) I do not think you would need to disarm the population for this to work. If anything the resulting imbalance of power between the people and authority would increase and abuse would worsen.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: I have absolutely no interest in politics, and I don't feel the need to. CMV\nNow, this is going to be somewhat of a tricky CMV because it's based on \"taste\" to some extent. I simply do not have any interest in politics and I don't feel guilty or uneducated because of this. Politics, elections, laws, policies, everything about it bores me to death. And I'm perfectly okay with this. \n\nMaybe it's because I don't see how politics directly affects me; maybe it's because I don't feel I can have any impact on it. Or it could just be that my brain isn't wired to care. People have different interests, and no one calls someone uneducated or ignorant for refusing to learn about food science or textiles.\n\nAnyway, I have neither the desire nor the need to follow and learn about politics. So, change my view! Make me care!\n\nEdit: Everyone had really great replies! At this point, I definitely see the benefit of caring about and involving myself in small scale politics. However, I still don't particularly see the point of memorizing how larger scale politics work (ie. how the Supreme Court Justices are decided, how laws are passed by congress, etc.) so this is still up for discussion.\nwatrenu: You know how they say \"The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything\"? That's the main argument against the kind of political apathy you feel. If you decide to not care, well then you have to live with the fact that other people will decide how you live your life.\n\nI understand finding it boring and not obsessing about politics like some people are inclined to do, but voting (at the minimum) is a civic duty of utmost importance. Politics are not a hobby, like food science or textiles, it's more like paying your taxes or sending your children to school. Law enforcement and the courts don't care about how you feel about politics, they will enforce the laws that other people have decided for you, if you decide to never voice your opinion/do something.\n\nAlso it is important to remember an individual's role in politics is certainly not restricted to casting a vote for the president once every four years. Every dollar you spend is a vote, remember this. Every minute you spend reading/watching media is a vote cast. Civil disobedience, boycotting, lobbying, running for office, strikes, protests, violent revolutions, those are all ways of impacting the political landscape ( I am not advocating a violent revolution but I just want to point out that when you let others decide the law for you on the basis of it being boring, people get mad and when it gets to that point, you don't vote the tyrant out of office, you shoot them. see for example: French Revolution, American Revolution, First Balkan War, [etc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revolutions_and_rebellions))\n\nso try and at least vote, it's really really really important for you not to throw away the gift of liberty that was fought for by the founders of America.\n\n\" What country ever existed a century and a half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? **The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants**. It is it's natural manure. \" -Thomas Jefferson to William Stephens Smith, Paris, 13 Nov. 1787\n\nsorry if this is kind of incoherent\n[deleted]: &gt;If you decide to not care, well then you have to live with the fact that other people will decide how you live your life.\n\nTrue, but caring doesn't mean I will have any effect on how politics affect my life. In fact, it's probably one of the few areas where how much I care has virtually no effect on how I live my life. Everything we do in influenced by other people: what we wear, what we eat, what we read, what we watch, how we exercise, what we buy, when we work, what careers we choose, who we trust. These are all things that we can change for ourselves, or we can let society choose for us. With politics, it seems to me to be more of society choosing for us; I guess I don't see how I can *really* affect anything without becoming a politician. With everything else in my life I can do my own research and decide for myself if I want to put the effort in. It's worth it to me.\n\n&gt;Politics are not a hobby, like food science or textiles, it's more like paying your taxes or sending your children to school.\n\nI legally have to pay taxes and send my children to school (or homeschool them at least.) I do not legally need to learn politics.\n\n&gt;they will enforce the laws that other people have decided for you, if you decide to never voice your opinion/do something.\n\nDo you have an example of a time when you changed a law that drastically affects you? I honestly just don't think I have that capability unless, again, I become a politician. Voting doesn't count. I mean do I actually have the capability to have a significant influence on the laws in my city/state/country without actually becoming a politician?\n\n&gt;Civil disobedience, boycotting, lobbying, running for office, strikes, protests, violent revolutions, those are all ways of impacting the political landscape\n\nHmm, this brings up a good point. I guess I was viewing politics as congress passing laws, presidential debates, all that jazz. I guess I can see how I'd be able to have an influence on very small scale politics, perhaps if I was part of a union for example. I never considered that \"politics\" per se, but I suppose it is. It doesn't mean that I would find it fascinating by any means, but perhaps I can see why I'd at least need to educate myself on how these things function. I still don't see the point in concerning myself with large scale issues (ie. anything larger than a very small town.)\n\n&gt;so try and at least vote\n\nHonestly, if I have absolutely no idea how congress works, I probably shouldn't be voting. I mean, I'll definitely vote for certain issues (I'll vote for gay marriage, for example) but I don't know enough to decide on anything more complex. And I know it's cliche, but I feel my vote really just doesn't matter.\nDivinityfound: &gt; I mean, I'll definitely vote for certain issues (I'll vote for gay marriage, for example) but I don't know enough to decide on anything more complex. And I know it's cliche, but I feel my vote really just doesn't matter.\n\nYou do care about politics, if not at least a little bit.\n[deleted]: That's true. I touched on this a bit in another comment. Basically, I care that gays have the right to marry, work, etc. but I'm not really concerned about the actual *politics* behind how that would happen. I guess I don't feel that checking a box really constitutes me caring about politics. If I cared I would study up on how Prop 8 made it from the California voters to the Supreme Court. But I didn't...\nDivinityfound: &gt; I'm not really concerned about the actual politics behind how that would happen.\n\nSo long as it happens.\n\nPoint is, you still had an opinion, you cast it, and hope your opinion passes one way or another.\n", "prompt": "[deleted]: I have absolutely no interest in politics, and I don't feel the need to.

{"full_text": "Axe_Ragnarok1: CMV: Dr. Strange, Multiverses of Madness used the Illuminati to push social justice down our throats.\nDuring the scene with Wanda confronting the Illuminati, several themes stood out;  \n- The Angry black man was effectively jailed and cast aside (but not killed).  Killing black men = bad.  (I am a black male)\n- the three cis-gender white males were rendered useless and quickly killed (its ok to kill cis-gender white males).  **Its not ok\n- and the only reason the two women were beaten is because a more capable woman was doing the beating.  \n\nNow, I know that comic books have addressed social issues as early as X-men, maybe before as well.  In these comics, Magneto and Xavier represented Malcolm X and Dr. King Jr respectively.  While the X-men represented disenfranchised groups based on their genetics.  It\u2019s because of this knowledge that I see how the MCU is currently driving the current social justice narrative.\nSlinkusmalinkus: What is \"the current social justice narrative\"? My understanding of Disney's Marvel products is that they are intended to reach the widest possible audiences and more likely to be playing to those preferences. Is \"the current social justice narrative\" just a way of referring to the broadest set of tastes as possible?\n\nWhy do you phrase it as \"shoving down our throats\"? Were you somehow forced to purchase the product?\nAxe_Ragnarok1: I don\u2019t have an issue with appeal to a wider audience.  That just means more movies. Good for us.  \nAnd no, I wasn\u2019t forced to purchase a ticket.  But if you take into account what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m forced to view these characters in a way that doesn\u2019t feel representative of how I know them.\nSlinkusmalinkus: Can you explain what \"the current social justice narrative\" means or have you changed your view in dropping this point?\n\n&gt;But if you take into account what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m forced to view these characters in a way that doesn\u2019t feel representative of how I know them.\n\nHow are you being forced?\nAxe_Ragnarok1: With regard to the post, SJ narrative;\n- cis gender white males are incompetent \n- women are great and can/ should only lose to a greater woman.\n\nIve changed my view of how a few characters were represented compared to my expectations, namely Xavier.  But not necessarily with regards to the ladies.  \n\nI can say that I probably wouldn\u2019t have this perspective if all the men weren\u2019t rendered useless, or killed at the start of the fight.  If, for example, Reed were able to contribute more to the fight, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve had this view.\nSlinkusmalinkus: This one film defines \"the current social justice narrative\"?\nAxe_Ragnarok1: No, I didn\u2019t say this one film defines the current narrative.  Im talking about the scene with Wanda vs Illuminati.\nSlinkusmalinkus: I was asking you to define \"the current social justice narrative\" and the definition you gave was recounting the scene which gave me the impression that your definition was contingent on this film rather than a frame of reference for your analysis of the film.\n\nPlease correct me where I have misunderstood.\nAxe_Ragnarok1: Current Social justice issues involve; Race, gender, age, and sexual orientation.  In this case, I'm not addressing sexual orientation or age. Gender inequality is the main driver, with race being secondary.\n\nSocial justice is invoked today while reinterpreting historical figures, in this case, Marvel heros.\n\nWith regard to gender; Gender inequality is being addressed by making one gender appear superior to another.  i.e. Cpt. Carter is reinterpreted as greater than Reed Richards.\n\nAs I mentioned before, all the males in the illuminati, except the old man, (I know Prof. X is more than an \"old man\", but you wouldn't know that from watching this) were killed first.  If gender inequality wasn't being tied to this, at least one of the fellas could have at least contributed.\n\nBut if that happened, would I have this perspective?  I don't think I would.\nSlinkusmalinkus: &gt;Current Social justice issues involve; Race, gender, age, and sexual orientation.  In this case, I'm not addressing sexual orientation or age. Gender inequality is the main driver, with race being secondary.\n&gt;\n&gt;Social justice is invoked today while reinterpreting historical figures, in this case, Marvel heros.\n\nThank you for clarifying.\n\n&gt;With regard to gender; Gender inequality is being addressed by making one gender appear superior to another.  i.e. Cpt. Carter is reinterpreted as greater than Reed Richards.\n\nHow does making one gender appear superior to the other address gender inequality? On that note, why would one woman character being superior to one man character indicate that the gender category \"woman\" is superior to the gender category \"man\"?\n\n&gt;As I mentioned before, all the males in the illuminati, except the old man, (I know Prof. X is more than an \"old man\", but you wouldn't know that from watching this) were killed first. \n\nHow does the death of some male characters indicative of a normative gender equality message?\n\n&gt;If gender inequality wasn't being tied to this, at least one of the fellas could have at least contributed.\n\nWhy would the existence of some useless male characters indicate a normative gender equality message?\n\n&gt;But if that happened, would I have this perspective?  I don't think I would.\n\nSo this film ran contrary to your expectations about gender roles in film/cinema/comic book movies and also ran contrary to your expectations regarding the relative strengths of characters of different gender categories, and on that basis you feel that the film was shoving/forcing a gender equality narrative down your throat? Am I understanding correctly?\nAxe_Ragnarok1: Im speaking specifically to how these characters were represented; comics vs movies.  The expectations were set by the comics and previous movies.  So yes, the expectations are contrary to previously set expectations. \n\nHence \u201creinterpreted \u201c\nSlinkusmalinkus: Okay. The problems I see with your view are twofold:\n\n1. Nothing about what you've said is particularly compelling evidence for the presence of a gender (in)equality theme.\n\n2. Even if it were the case that there was a gender (in)equality theme, we still circle back to this unresolved problem of what exactly is shoving this film or theme down your throat or forcing you to watch it.\nAxe_Ragnarok1: &gt;Nothing about what you've said is particularly compelling evidence for the presence of a gender (in)equality theme.\n\nI'm making a couple assumptions.  \n\n\\- The first assumption is that you've seen this movie, as we are discussing said movie.  \n\n\\- The other assumption I'm making, although possibly inaccurately for most, is that you're familiar with the previous movies and shows; Iron Man through Avengers Endgame, Disney+ shows, X-men movies, Fantastic 4 movies\n\nWithin the time of these films and shows, it can be argued that the ladies haven't been represented as effectively  as the men.  The examples of powerful female characters was either poorly presented, (Cpt. Marvel, Phoenix), or not presented at all.   That began to change with WandaVision.  Wanda was finally being represented much more in line with her comics version.  This was a good thing.\n\nCaptain Carter was recently introduced in \"What if\".  Here, she was shown to be more capable than Steve Rogers, as she had previous military training, and was rather confident and capable right out of the gate.  Ok, I'll buy it for the sake of lack of time for character development.  What if was only 30 min episodes.\n\nMy issue is this:  Wanda was more than capable of destroying all the Illuminati as presented.  By rights, all things being equal, she could have destroyed them all in record time. \n\nBut that's not how it played out.  The men were rendered helpless, and killed first.    Why was this the direction of the fight?  The ladies, Cpt. Carter and Cpt. Marvel where able to fight her off for quite a while, comparatively.  Was this because they were more capable than the members that have been killed?  \n\nFrom my perspective, its because they were women.  Not because they were more capable.  These characters have been reinterpreted to show that these women were better than the men, for no reason other than they are women.  \n\nThe social justice narrative I'm speaking of works to highlight how much better women are than men.

{"full_text": "TheZombaslaya: CMV: Americans who live abroad should NOT be subject to US taxation\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, the US is one of two countries in the world, (other being Eritrea), which tax based on citizenship instead of residency.  Most countries have a policy where if you live here, you\u2019re a taxpayer.  The US on the other hand says \u201cIf you\u2019re an American, you\u2019re a taxpayer.\u201d  This means that Americans are subject to taxation no matter where they live, not just in the United States.  If you have American citizenship but live in another country, you must file and pay your country\u2019s taxes as well as file and possibly pay American taxes.  On top of this, the US requires those with foreign bank accounts over $10,000 to file an FBAR form to declare it and their assets.  While the US has agreements in place to limit double taxation (generally if you make under around $100,000~), you still must file tax returns, and due to the obvious complication of living abroad, this can often require an accountant, costing hundreds if not thousands of dollars annually.  Not all forms of income are covered by tax agreements, one noticeable exception is capital gains tax.  If you buy and sell a house, the IRS may come after you for tax on the house.  Mutual Funds are a popular investment, particularly for those saving for retirement.  However, if you live abroad, the IRS considers foreign mutual funds \u201cpassive foreign investment companies\u201d and taxes them at a punitive rate, taking any interest and profit you might make.  \n\nhttps://thunfinancial.com/home/american-expat-financial-advice-research-articles/why-americans-should-never-ever-own-shares-in-a-non-us-incorporated-mutual-fund/\n\nIn 2010, the Obama administration passed a law called FATCA, which blackmails foreign banks into investigating their account holders and clients to find Americans and those with American citizenship and report their accounts the the IRS.  While this law was meant to be a way to crack down on domestic tax evasion, it has become a nightmare for American expats and dual citizens.  If banks don\u2019t comply, they are fined 30% of their U.S. investments.  This has lead to many people loosing their accounts and mortgages as many banks do not want the headache of dealing with the IRS.  \n\nIt\u2019s not just Americans abroad who have to navigate this headache, people who are American citizens who may have never lived in America are subject to these laws, so called \u201cAccidental Americans.\u201d  Under the 14th Amendment, the US grants citizenship to anyone born in the country with the exception of diplomats.  While birthright citizenship may be a blessing to those who want to live in America, it is an absolute nightmare for people born in America while their parents were on vacation or temporarily in the country.  Imagine being Italian, and one of your parents is studying a masters or a PHD at an American university.  You happen to be born while they\u2019re studying, and a couple months later move back to Italy.  Even worse, let\u2019s say one of your parents happens to be American, and you\u2019re born in Italy, and never visit America.  You grow up Italian, speak Italian, you might not even learn English.  You\u2019re just as Italian as anyone else, except, you have American citizenship as well.  Maybe you become 30 years old, you have a life, own a house, a car, you work and are saving for retirement and have all the normal financial assets one would have.  One day, you open the mail and have a letter from your bank.  Your bank is asking for your social security number due to some strange new American law, and if you don\u2019t provide it, your accounts will be closed.  You think it\u2019s a mistake, until you do some research, and see that America can tax all your assets, and you should have been filing American taxes and FBARs for years.  Getting \u201ctax compliant\u201d will cost thousands of dollars in accounting fees, as generally there are few US tax accountants in Italy.  And besides, why do you need to comply with a foreign country\u2019s laws regarding your finances when you have absolutely no ties to that country?  You think, can I just cancel my citizenship and avoid this nightmare? Nope, to renounce your citizenship, that will cost $2,300 and require being tax compliant for 5 years.  In addition, depending on your wealth, you may need to pay a 10% \u201cexit\u201d tax on all your assets.  If the U.S. Government suspects you are renouncing due to tax reasons, you can be banned from ever visiting America.  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/7kK5teCY3Qw\n\nIn 2012, Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, who was living in Singapore at the time canceled his US citizenship which would avoid an estimated $700 Million in capital gains taxes.  This move prompted Senator Chuck Schumer to introduce a bill which would require those renouncing their citizenships to prove it is not for tax reasons.  If someone had a net worth of over $2,000,000, they would be banned from returning to America and be subject to a 30% tax on capital gains.  Thankfully the bill died, but it shows how the government does not care about Americans abroad.  \n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/senators-target-facebook-co-founder-for-giving-up-citizenship-seek-to-impose-taxes\n\nLike I mentioned at the beginning, the other country to do this is Eritrea.  Eritrea has come under international fire for harassing Eritreans living abroad for taxes.  This has lead to the UN general assembly passing a resolution condemning Eritrea for doing this, and many Eritrean diplomats have been expelled from various countries over Eritrea\u2019s citizenship based taxation, including Canada.  Canada has condemned Eritrea\u2019s attempts to tax its citizens, but has been silent and downright cooperative in another country\u2019s efforts in taxation, the United States.  Most countries have fallen in line and are ignoring or even assisting the US\u2019s efforts in hunting down expats and taxing them.  Maybe it has to do with the fact Eritrea\u2019s a poor African nation with a spotty human rights record.  \n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8sM_vlbDuAhWIPM0KHekMALcQFjADegQIAxAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Feritrean-diplomat-ordered-out-of-canada-after-tax-on-ex-pats-1.1309691&amp;usg=AOvVaw3XCez9rEgagNIf_CKS4Gz6  \n\nCitizenship based taxation defies common sense.  You should pay taxes where you live, and where your income is sourced from.  You use the infrastructure where you live, and benefit from the government that oversees your jurisdiction.  Expats don\u2019t use US schools, roads or anything else besides maybe renewing their passport.  Why should they have to pay?  Every other country in the world besides the US and Eritrea has a residency based tax system.  If you\u2019re an Italian and you live in the US, you only file and pay US taxes, but if you\u2019re an American living in Italy, you have to file and pay Italian taxes, as well as possibly US taxes.  It\u2019s an extremely unfair system, and the government has gone out of its way to make life even more difficult for Americans abroad.  After FATCA was passed, the US saw many expats were canceling their citizenship.  Instead of reviewing why this was, the US proceeds to raise the fee to do so to over $2,000.  Americans abroad also do not get their own representative, they vote in the state which they last lived in, so in that regard they\u2019re considered a state resident, even while living in a completely different country.  What happened to \u201cno taxation without representation?\u201d  There has been a lot of debate over privilege in America, and discrimination.  In these debates, I have not heard one word about Americans living abroad, who are some of the most discriminated against and overlooked Americans.  Expats want to be left alone, and live their lives like anyone else, and not be burdened with draconian financial and tax requirements to what is basically a foreign government.  This has to change.\nMcKoijion: 1. If you pay taxes in a foreign country, you don't have to pay them in the US too. You get a foreign tax credit. So if you go to a lower tax country, you pay the same as if you lived in the US. If you go to a higher tax country, you won't pay the US anything.\n\n2. The US government provides a bunch of services that make it easier for Americans to live abroad. For example, if there is a crisis in your new country, the closest US embassy will send a helicopter filled with fully armed marines to pick you up. The US also exerts significant power to protect American-owned businesses, patents, assets, etc. from foreign governments/powers.\n\n3. You still retain all the rights of an American citizen if you live abroad, such as voting.\nTheZombaslaya: It\u2019s true you get a credit, however you still have to file taxes and FBARs for your bank accounts, which can get complicated and often require tax specialists to complete.  Not all income is included in that exemption, such as mutual funds and capital gains.  \n\nNothing unique to america, many countries provide those services and will evacuate citizens from dangerous areas if need be.  It wasn\u2019t just America that organized flights to wuhan to pick people up when the coronavirus first started.  It is true America has some of the best consular service in the world, but I can safely say it isn\u2019t a result of extra tax money from expats. \n\nMost countries allow citizens to vote from abroad without requiring them to be taxed.  If loosing voting rights is the price for not having to pay taxes abroad, then I\u2019d be more than happy to pay that price.\nmuyamable: &gt;Most countries allow citizens to vote from abroad without requiring them to be taxed.  If loosing voting rights is the price for not having to pay taxes abroad, then I\u2019d be more than happy to pay that price.\n\nSo, pay it? I mean, the solution is easy -- get citizenship somewhere else and renounce your U.S. citizenship. People aren't without choices here.\nTheZombaslaya: Not always practical for everyone, some people have family in the US they would like to visit or need to take care of for example.  Also life can change, maybe 20 years down the road they\u2019ll get a job offer and move back to the US.  Also you generally need another nationality to renounce your citizenship otherwise you\u2019ll become stateless, and naturalizing is not always an easy task.\nmuyamable: &gt; Not always practical for everyone, some people have family in the US they would like to visit or need to take care of for example. Also life can change, maybe 20 years down the road they\u2019ll get a job offer and move back to the US\n\nExactly. And that's my point. On one hand you're saying expats shouldn't be taxed because they don't benefit from U.S. citizenship, but on the other hand you're saying we can't expect expats to give up their citizenship to avoid taxes because they'd have to give up those benefits they derive from U.S. citizenship. If they truly derived no benefits from U.S. citizenship, it wouldn't be a difficult choice.\neevreen: I think the point is more so that if other countries have the same benefits American expats have from their countries without having to also pay their country's taxes or file taxes with their country, it is both possible and more reasonable for America to follow suit. Your argument doesn't really respond to that other than to say \"don't like it, leave\" which is not a reasonable response. I haven't heard an actual *reason* for why Americans have to do this while other first world countries don't force their expat citizens to pay taxes.\nphenixcitywon: your comment, as well as the ops, relies on a presumption that \"not taxing nonresidents\" is the correct, default option. \n\nthere's no inherent reason why that is the case, and neither you nor the OP have demonstrated why it should be the case. \n\n\"That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence\"\neevreen: There are only three countries in the world which tax expats. USA, Eritrea, and Myanmar. If 200 odd countries decide not to tax expats and 3 do, which would you presume to be the logical norm?\nphenixcitywon: i wouldn't presume anything... because there's no logical norm? \n\nalso, you say \"decide not to\" as if it's identical to \"functionally aren't able to, so don't bother\"\neevreen: If countries as small as Eritrea and Myanmar were functionally able to, I don't see why countries such as the UK, China, Russia, and any other country aren't functionally able to.\nphenixcitywon: eritrea and myanmar have a) no rich people b) no capacity to force rich expats to pay their domestic non-resident citizen tax, so who cares what their book law says about it.\neevreen: If they can't force their expats to pay, then functionally *only* the US makes expats pay taxes based on citizenship, which goes back to the point OP (and I) were making earlier: there is no reason this shouldn't change.\nphenixcitywon: \"we can make you pay, others can't\" isn't a reason for change...\n", "prompt": "TheZombaslaya: CMV: Americans who live abroad should NOT be subject to US taxation\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, the US is one of two countries in the world, (other being Eritrea), which tax based on citizenship instead of residency.

They basically just had a slightly different unemployment/welfare program and didnt study any of the effects of what would happen if you gave money to people who were already doing reasonably well in their finances.\ndid_you_read_it: UBI seems great, when wearing my idealist hat it feels like more than just an amicable goal but one that could signal a next great leap in civilization.  where the Agricultural revolution freed up humanity to pursue more diverse work a UBI could free up humanity to pursue self actualization.  why should society be such that i must spend the bulk of my life working. \n\n\nOTOH I have no idea how it would even work or *if* it could work.  Economy is a funny thing and this could just result in a flat inflation, or even create dystopian lifestyle where the majority subsist in poor government housing, cared for but not really living.  Not to mention that right now we do still need  people to work. As the saying goes \"the world needs ditch diggers too\"\n\n\nI think we won't really see this hit until we move into a post-labor scarcity world.  We have already shifted economics in a time where many products only have artificial scarcity.  Music, movies, programs can all be copied indefinitely, even many physical products have little physical value.   With robotics and AI it seems that eventually we will reach the singularity, where base human labor is obsolete in all but the most niche areas.\nkuhzoo: &gt; UBI seems great, when wearing my idealist hat ...\n\nTo be fair though, that seems like the case for Communism, Capitalism, Democracy, Monarchy, Anarchism, etc.  Just sit back and listen to the tone of an amateur philosopher who's just read a book about one of the above and fallen in love with the idea of it.\n\nPersonally, I'm of the opinion that every system I listed above in it's pure form will fail for various reasons.  Capitalism devolves into monopolies. Communism gets co-opted by greed.  Democracies ham-string great individual leaders. Monarchies are brought down by one bad, or sometimes even mediocre, leader.  Anarchism doesn't really scale with population growth. ... And the flaws keep going.  At that point the solution to the draw-backs of one is to balance it with the benefits and draw-backs of another.  The US has historically been strongly capitalist, but there have often been mitigating communist/socialist policies, like The New Deal, eras with strong unions, etc. too.  \nAt which point we get back to UBI, and I see it as a dose of socialism to try to keep the draw-backs of capitalism in check.  (AFAICT, right now the US is running full steam toward the pure capitalism ending ... which would explain the rise in more socialist ideas.  People are trying to curve us back toward equilibrium.)\n\nOur idealized systems fail when they come into contact with reality where different people have different problems and priorities. Different enough problems and priorities that no one system will adequately support all of them.  Even using multiple systems to balance each other will still cause chafing and strife, but can prevent us from ever catastrophically failing the way, I believe, pure systems inevitably do.  Even the solution of 'balance' fails because someone always wants to unbalance it to get rid of their own pain points (or because they fell in love with an ideal).  \nThere is no one solution.  Like life, it's an ever shifting balance that collapses and fails if it goes too far toward any extreme or it can't adapt to it's changing environment.\ndid_you_read_it: There could be a future solution. Problem really is that all society is a pyramid (at best maybe a box). Under any scheme, doesn't matter if you're communist capitalist or socialist. \n\n\"The world needs ditch diggers too\"  The only difference is who ends up as one and why.\n\n*however* I think eventually we will reach the robotic singularity and we could build a human society where almost nobody is the base of the pyramid.  Propped up on a tireless army of robotic slave labor we could potentially achieve some aspect of these ideal governments. sure there will always be people at the \"bottom\" but when the bottom is 6 layers of robots up from the ground that could be some pretty cushy living.\nkuhzoo: Based on [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/extreme-poverty-america-un-special-monitor-report)^1 I don't think your robotic singularity will happen and if it does, it still won't make the changes you think it will.  There will be people either left behind without robots to support them, or there will still be tasks we can't fully automate that'll require humans down at the very bottom with the robots.  The US is the richest nation in the world by many estimates, and we have citizens living in conditions we would consider 'poor' in a 3rd world nation.\n\nYour ideal of a post-robotic singularity fails for the same reason all the other ideals fail, reality is too messy and inconsistent for everyone to fit into it... and many of those people who don't fit will be necessary to keep it going.\n\n1: warning link does not qualify as 'uplifting'\n", "prompt": "ratskim: Universal basic income seems to improve employment and well-being - The world\u2019s most robust study of universal basic income has concluded that it boosts recipients\u2019 mental and financial well-being, as well as modestly improving employment.\n\nw1n5t0nM1k3y: This study keeps getting cited", "orig": ", but seems to have a major flaw in regards to testing the UBI.

And most boards don't do current or temp monitoring so a clogged coil would still trip the thermal overload of the compressor.\nineedaneasybutton: Thermal overload is the last safety to protect your compressor. It protects from temp only. Res techs thinking a thermal will always protect the compressor... They must last forever cause they have a thermal overload that always works.\n\nI've seen the internal relief blow and not reset before the thermal tripped. I went to an 06E that pumped all its oil out and not trip oil pressure because it was bypassed, comp locked. There's 100s of situations where the thermal will not save your compressor.\n\nNow if your coil is clogged chances are you'll notice it hot in your house and if you bypassed the CLO the compressor goes out on thermal. Not everytime.\nfrosty95: Not sure why you decided to wiki explain a thermal overload to me? Also not sure why you are talking about commercial units with oil pumps? I also never said going off on overload was ok? Anyways.... Again. Most residential units are not measuring current or temp. My point was only that yes a thermostat can serve a similar functionality to a basic startup timer lockout board. Am I wrong?\nineedaneasybutton: &gt;similar functionality to a basic startup timer lockout board.\n\nBecause you are telling people this and it is not true and the hack jobs done by people saying this cost people money.\n\nThe thermostat prevents short cycling from cooling/heating calls only. The lock out timer prevents all short cycling.\n\nMost res units are measuring pressure.\nfrosty95: That's no longer a basic lockout board. What part of basic are you failing to understand? Clearly if it has pressure controls what I said is no longer applicable.\nineedaneasybutton: You literally have no clue what you're talking about. I even linked a delay on break timer elsewhere which is the most basic lock out there is. **Almost all res units in use have pressure cut outs**.\n\nA basic lock out board or timer delays the contactor from pulling in if the 24v is broken from pressure, from calls, from power disruption. If it is broken for any reason.\n\nThere are plenty of res units that have current sensing. Sorry if I used CLO as general compressor lock out and not just current sensing lock out. The terms are used interchangably often where I am.\nfrosty95: I saw two in the last week with no pressure cutouts lol. Many units simply don't have them around here. Guess that makes me an idiot.\nineedaneasybutton: I said almost all, not all. Many of those have no high pressure cut out. That doesn't change anything about what I said.

{"full_text": "David_Robert: Does meta-ethics have any bearing on our decision-making?\nAccording to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics), \"[s]ome theorists argue that a metaphysical account of morality is necessary for the proper evaluation of actual moral theories and for making practical moral decisions.\" I disagree. I contend that [meta-ethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics) has no bearing on one\u2019s decision-making, at least not in the way that is commonly believed.\n\nExcept when one is solely concerned with correctly and consistently applying one\u2019s ethical positions (i.e. revising one\u2019s ethical judgments based on new beliefs about the way things are or based on perceived inconsistencies between one\u2019s ethical judgments, or formulating new ethical judgments that seem to be consistent with preexisting ones), certain emotional processes*, such as empathy, are causally necessary to make ethical judgments and/or to act accordingly in a consistent manner (i.e. because people who lack empathy, even if they are capable of consistently distinguishing right from wrong, will be motivated to do the right thing only if they believe that it is in their self-interest, as [research](http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/59.full) indicates).\n\n*These emotional processes can be controlled only through the process described above of determining how to correctly and consistently apply one\u2019s ethical positions, and can be suppressed by other emotional processes (e.g. anger), which by their very nature are not susceptible to meta-ethical arguments. Furthermore, it does not seem plausible that people with a capacity for empathy would, on the basis of meta-ethical arguments, voluntarily and knowingly attempt to reduce their empathy by [desensitizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_%28psychology%29) themselves to the suffering of others.\n\nIn conclusion, meta-ethical arguments (with the possible exception of arguments dealing with the nature of freedom and its significance for moral responsibility) cannot affect one\u2019s practical ethical decision-making processes any more than arguments in the philosophy of mathematics. If meta-ethical arguments can have any effect at all on one\u2019s decision-making in ethical matters, it is by helping one to think about how to consistently and correctly apply one\u2019s ethical positions (as described above).\nslickwombat: What those \"some theorists\" are saying, presumably, is that one needs a good metaethical theory to ground one's normative ethical theory, and that applied ethics in turn should consist of putting our normative theory into practice.\n\nYou are proposing an idea of how people *do in fact* go about making ethical judgements, and saying that metaethics isn't involved. Whether or not your psychological account is correct is irrelevant. Nobody is claiming that people typically sit down and work out a metaethical theory before deciding on moral matters, even on an informal level. They are talking about how moral decisions *should*, rationally, be done. \nDavid_Robert: I am proposing that moral decisions can't be done in any other way than the one that I described. Thus, it seems futile to argue that moral decisions *should* be done in some other way.\nslickwombat: I'm not following then. Why is it that moral decisions *cannot* be informed by moral philosophy?\nDavid_Robert: I believe that meta-ethical arguments are useful for decision-making only in so far as they can (very indirectly) help to kick start the process of revising one\u2019s ethical judgments based on new beliefs about the way things are or based on perceived inconsistencies between one\u2019s ethical judgments, or the process of formulating new ethical judgments based on their perceived consistency with preexisting ones.\nslickwombat: Sorry, are you saying that metaethics *cannot* inform moral decisions, or that they aren't useful and therefore *shouldn't*? It's not clear to me if your claim is a descriptive, epistemic-normative, or prudential one.\n\nIn any case, I'm not seeing how you're getting there... let's use an example to hopefully clarify.\n\nSuppose a squirrel is chewing up my attic, and I wish to determine whether it's morally permissible for me to shoot the squirrel (which is easy) or humanely trap it (which is very difficult). So I determine some metaethical theory, which grounds some normative theory, the application of which leads the decision that sentient creatures shouldn't be harmed. Consequently I determine that it would be wrong to shoot the squirrel and, though it's more difficult, I should trap and relocate it.\n\nIn that account, what exactly are you saying cannot happen, or is an error in judgement?\nDavid_Robert: I am proposing that metaethics cannot directly inform decisions regarding our *conduct* (with the possible exception of arguments dealing with the nature of freedom and its significance for moral responsibility). Hence, I am making a descriptive claim. In your example, your formulation of some meta-ethical theory is only causally necessary for your decision not to shoot the squirrel in so far as it may have helped you, and only indirectly, to determine how to correctly and consistently apply your ethical positions (see description above).\nslickwombat: Hang on, so are you just saying metaethics doesn't *directly* tell us what is right or wrong to do? That's trivially true in that how to actually behave is within the scope of normative/applied ethics rather than metaethics.\nDavid_Robert: I am arguing that it is false that a metaphysical account of morality is necessary for properly making practical decisions about our conduct since we don't need a metaphysical account of morality in order to determine how to revise our ethical judgments based on new beliefs about the way things are or based on perceived inconsistencies between our ethical judgments, or to formulate new ethical judgments based on their perceived consistency with preexisting ones.\n", "prompt": "David_Robert: Does meta-ethics have any bearing on our decision-making?\nAccording to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics), \"[s]ome theorists argue that a metaphysical account of morality is necessary for the proper evaluation of actual moral theories and for making practical", "orig": "moral decisions.\" I disagree.

I was originally going to build in a large cabinet for a TV, but decided it would be easier just to mount it on the wall... leaves things a little more flexible if I ever decided to buy a bigger TV.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. How close to the wall does the TV sit?  \n\n1. Do you have to be centered on studs? \n\n1. Any other tips/tricks/hacks I should be aware of?\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nNeanderStaal: The distance from the wall is determined by the depth of the mount you choose. Any not-crap mount will have this information easily available online, or at the very least, in the manual contained in the box.\n\nWhile having the mount centred on the studs would be ideal, you should really be trying to hit the visual centre of your viewing area. Any not-crap mount should be stable off centre. If you have a particularly large plasma (ie, greater than 50\" diagonally), a suitable mount will probably be wide enough to span 3 studs.\n\nOh, and for in wall wiring, be sure to mark out the spot where your wires will exit the wall before mounting the back plate of the mount to the wall. Bring the wiring out the wall first as well. Fishing through hardware sucks.\n\nJimmyDThing: Any advice on good mounts?\n\nAlso, on the wiring... I'm starting with scratch so I can do the wiring before the drywall goes up, so it'll save me that hassle.  Also, because I'm doing built-in cabinets, I don't have to drill through any studs, there's nothing behind the wall studs. \nNeanderStaal: Where I work, we make exclusive use of [Peerless](http://www.peerlessmounts.com/) mounts.\n\nYou DO have to worry about some hassle with the wiring, because you'll need to know where you want the wires to exit the wall behind the TV. If the desired location for the mount conflicts with the exit point of the wires, then you've got a hassle going on. If you are installing a plate (decora or equivalent) where the wires exit the wall, then you've got even more planning to do! \n\nI guess I spend more time making sure that the TVs that I'm mounting are either exactly where they are supposed to be as per the drawings for the site I'm on, or in locations constrained by other visual and physical elements, so maybe my concern for marking and measuring everything in advanced is a little bit heightened in comparison with a casual residential install.\n\nPM me if you want to move this into specifics. Always happy to help.\nJimmyDThing: Ah sorry, what I meant was that I don't have to fish any wire because I don't have any sheetrock in the way.\n\n\nAs far as plates go, I'm debating 2 things.  One is to put an HDMI and stereo audio jacks in every cabinet in the built-in cabinets.  The other is to use something like [this](http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=104&amp;cp_id=10425&amp;cs_id=1042505&amp;p_id=3996&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2), which is what I'm doing for speakers so I don't have an extra connection in-between.  \n\nBut now I see what you're saying about how the desired mount location may interfere with the exit point for the wires.  \n\n\n[This one](http://www.peerlessmounts.com/dyn/Products/BrowseProduct.aspx/tn/58/u/t/av/8011) seems pretty cool... I do like the idea of an in-wall mount.  Have you installed any?    Do you know if they end up being completely flush with the wall?\nNeanderStaal: We use a very similar passthru plate rather than add additional connections as well. I like 'em.\n\nAs for the mount, they install such that the depth of the pivoting arms is within the wall, but the tilting portion of the mount is outside (otherwise it could not be tilted when in a closed position, which would suck a bit).\nJimmyDThing: Got it, thank you.  That makes sense.  They are quite a bit more expensive, so it would have to be something to think about.\n\nI'm not one to tilt the screen, but I am going to have to raise my TV up a little bit in the basement from where it is in the living room right now, so it would be nice for that to be an option. \nNeanderStaal: I would recommend a tilting mount, in order to help knock glare off the screen.\nJimmyDThing: I know what you mean... but it'll be in a basement with only 1 window that can easily be covered.  Glare really won't be much of an issue. \nNeanderStaal: No lights?\nJimmyDThing: Well, I'll have low-level lights.  I'm thinking sconce's on the wall.

I would use [antagonistic supersets](https://www.strengthsensei.com/antagonist-double-stations-vs-single-sets/) rather than push pull legs. Then you can do upper lower and have recovery days or days to do something else like aerobic training which can help you gain mass too. \n\n\n\nTwo. Use a 3-4 second eccentric on your movements since eccentrics help to build mass. \n\n\nThree. Eat enough. \nIssvor_: https://medium.com/@SandCResearch/what-is-time-under-tension-d96afdea16e6\n\nTime under tension doesn't mean much. As long as the weight is controlled and not thrown around, you'll gain mass.\nMindfulMover: I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re talking about. I didn\u2019t mention anything about TUT. \nIssvor_: &gt;use a 3 to 4 second eccentric on your movements since the eccentric builds mass\n\nThat is time under tension\nMindfulMover: Okay. And your point is the timing you use during your eccentric doesn\u2019t matter? Cause if so, I highly disagree. \nIssvor_: &gt; Whether we use a fast or a slow tempo, the stimulating time under tension is largely the same. Only in the final reps, when bar speed has slowed down in the fast tempo set, and when motor unit recruitment has increased in the slow tempo set, is muscle growth stimulated.\n\nThis is straight from the article.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/__7abSf4D7Q this video, which has an article if you'd prefer that, also agrees that as long as you control the weight, TUT doesn't matter\nMindfulMover: Yeah I get that. I just don\u2019t fully agree with the article. \nIssvor_: The video linked had 5 studies that also declare TUT as negligible\nMindfulMover: Eh. Like I said, I don\u2019t fully agree. I don\u2019t even think the terms are specific enough to even have a discussion on, really. \n\n\nWhat qualifies as \u201ccontrolling the weight?\u201d?  Is it lowering in 1s? Or 4? \n\n\n\nIssvor_: It means completely the full range of motion, doing both the concentric or eccentric, not just dropping or swinging the weights\nMindfulMover: So then there is an eccentric and there is a TUT since you\u2019re lowering down in control. \n\n\nThat\u2019s why the article doesn\u2019t make much sense. It\u2019s like \u201cTUT doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Then it proceeds to use TUT. \nIssvor_: Sorry, I guess I should've elaborated.

Because the first example takes 20s. The second example takes 100. That\u2019s a very wide gap between the two. \nIssvor_: According to the studies and in terms of hypertrophy, that is correct. At least one of the studies in the YouTube video so pointed out that with shorter TUT, you won't get as fatigued add you would with a longer TUT, and because of this, you can handle more volume and intensity, thus allowing for more hypertrophy\nMindfulMover: I can see where this is going.

By 1975 the Soviet Union had crept up to somewhere between 40 percent and 60 percent of the American level of GNP\n\n&gt; \u2026\n\n&gt; They realized that the USSR as presently constituted simply could not match a United States that was both a rich consumer society and a global superpower. In the 1970s Gorbachev (then a high apparatchik) was taken to a Canadian supermarket, a cathedral of consumption. He was impressed but suspected a fake Potemkin village stocked for his benefit. He asked his driver to stop unscheduled at a second supermarket. It was just as abundant. Capitalism was a success and the cadres knew it. Their historic aspiration for world leadership sagged.\n\nAccording to *Sources*, the early days of industrialization and military buildup were very successful, bringing high economic growth and especially education. But productivity was always modest due to lacking incentives.

{"full_text": "mastair86: Am I on the right track now?\nSorry for the long story, if you don\u2019t have the time or urge to read it, move along. Otherwise I appreciate your time.\n\n\nI am 30 yo, 193 cm (6\u20194\u201d) and 83.5 kg (184 lbs). I guess purely based on these numbers not that bad, but still what you probably would call skinny fat, but now I feel like I want to change this. See http://imgur.com/a/Al8L9 for pictures (sorry for the angles).\n\n\nLet me first introduce my story by a few lines.\n\n\nNever done a lot of exercising in the past. 4 years ago, I graduated from university and since then I am working as software engineer and consultant which hasn\u2019t been that positive in terms of my physical performance (100% of time sitting behind computer.). I like my job very much, I would say I am very ambitious and feel very responsible for all that happens. Then after 1 year of working I started developing RSI symptoms (cold hands, painful wrists, not able to lay your arms onto anything really), for which I saw numerous specialist of which none of them could help me and told me that I would have to live with it, and so I did. Then after a couple of months I started developing neck and back pain, which got through to my head as headaches. I never called myself in sick though, and continued working like a mad man, most weeks longer than needed and even in the evening colleagues got replies to their e-mails from me. I started seeing Cesar (I guess that term is only used in NL) and Mensendieck therapists to improve my posture and went to manual therapists to somehow improve my back and neck pain, but it never cured it. Then in summer last year, I started getting real dizzy, a couple of times (almost) fainting and a neurologist concluded it was chronical hyperventilation. I got breathing and relaxation therapy which helped somewhat until December last year I got tingling issues in both legs and arms and stings in my head and got again very dizzy. It was only then that I realized I could not continue like that, and called myself in sick.\n\n\nSo went back to the GP, and after some checks again with neurologist he concluded psychosomatic symptoms. Seeing psychology therapist now, and continuing Cesar therapy and manual therapy, and things got a little better, though I am not cured. Working only 2 half days a week. Though since last week I feel things got a tiny little better.\n\n\nIn the meantime, I am trying everything to get rid of my issues, of which one is bodyweight fitness.\n\n\nMy overall goal, body mind wise:\n\n* Getting and feeling stronger, not like a 70 yo in a 30 yo body..\n* I\u2019d like to get leaner (get rid of fatty manboobs and belly)..\n\nWhat I am doing now (next to therapies):\n\n* 3 x a week recommended routine (since ~2 months) to get strength back in core, and I actually feel like it\u2019s fun, though I\u2019m a little bit impatient. Would like to get to freestanding HS eventually and getting leaner and more body. Already saw quite some progress in terms of planking times, but also moved from vertical rows to almost horizontal, wall pushup to full push up. Doing L-sit with one leg up now, etc.\n* 1 x a week Yoga (since a month), more of a relaxation yoga with only 7 poses and finishing off with half an hour of meditation\n* Loads of walking\n* On average 1 x swimming a week\n* On average 0 \u2013 1 x running a week (0.5 hrs)\n* Reading \u201cThe mindbody prescription\u201d on TMS of John Sarno to understand how the psychosomatic symptoms are developed and how to influence them. I realize now that it may indeed be repressed childhood trauma that causes my symptoms.\n* Doing some meditation on my own using Headspace app\n* Applying rational emotive therapy\n* I\u2019m on Keto diet with 20% calorie deficit, I guess this also helps me to feel a little more energized, and hopefully it gets me a bit leaner without destroying muscles. I feel like it, but I do not see a lot of progress now I am looking at my own pictures.\n\n\nNow I am curious what you think about what I am doing at the moment! Should I change something?  Am I doing too much, or too little? Do you see progress in the pics? I could ask very specific questions which I won\u2019t, so I hope to get more general feedback as well. One specific question though, what bf % do you think I have now?\n\nyaoz889: You seem to be progressing, which is great. Just make sure you consume enough protein, so you maintain your gains. I suggest you add jump rope if you can, just to increase the speed of your progression. Like 5-10 min in the mornings right after you wake up.\nKrygess: Would 5-10 minutes of early morning jump rope be more for cardio or to increase calorie deficit? That sounds like an easy enough thing to implement for me. Just would like to know what it would benefit most. \nyaoz889: More for cardio. If you look at the research online, jumping rope is up there as one of the top excercises out there. However, jumping 10min straight is not easy.\nI just started a few weeks ago and I just try the best I can every morning.\nKrygess: I really just meant devoting the time to it. Not actually jumping rope for that long straight. I'm optimistic for the most part, but that'd be dumb to think I could do it right away. \n\nBut thanks for the information! I really needed cardio but couldn't find something I actually enjoyed. I'll give this a try! \nyaoz889: Make sure you get a good rope though. There is a difference in quality between the wire ones coated with plastic and the pure plastic ones\nKrygess: I had not even thought about that... Thanks! Which one is better quality? \nyaoz889: Personally, I bought this one: https://www.amazon.com/WOD-Wear-Adjustable-Speed-Cable/dp/B0107QTSI6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1489447192&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=wod+nation+speed+jump+rope\n\nA very good quality rope.

{"full_text": "chenthehen: YSK: Don't let one IQ score bring you down\n Why YSK: Because people believe that IQ is the end all be all of intelligence, and believe that once they score low on a IQ test they feel hopeless and worthless. People who score low on a IQ test typically give up on school and life because they believe that they can't do it. People who score low (lower than 90) also have the tendency to suffer self esteem issues and depression. On the other hand people that score high on IQ tests sometimes have the tendency to believe that they can be able to do anything they can, which isn't true. I just want to mention to people that IQ shouldn't determine your outcome. \n\nI mean IQ doesn't really measure everything that has to do with intelligence. The triarchic theory of intelligence is a more holistic approach than IQ. So it's still possible to have a slightly lower IQ (80-90) range and still be able to do well in school and life. It's possible to score lower on a IQ test and still be smart. \n\nAlso, notice that it's possible that learning disabilities and attention issues would result in a lower IQ in otherwise smart people. It's also possible that a lower IQ is caused by the person not really trying on the test. \n\nThe triarchic theory of intelligence states that intelligence can be split into three types, however IQ measures mainly analytical intelligence (and it doesn't necessarily measure even that all that well).\n\n1. **Analytical Intelligence** \\- refers to the ability to complete academic, problem-solving tasks, such as those used in traditional intelligence tests. These types of tasks usually present well-defined problems that have only a single correct answer\n2. **Creative intelligence** \\- refers to the ability to successfully deal with new and unusual situations by drawing on existing knowledge and skills.\n3. **Practical intelligence** \\- refers to the ability to adapt to everyday life by drawing on existing knowledge and skills\n\nI feel that I'm average when it comes to practical intelligence, and kinda good (although not great) when it comes to analytical intelligence. I'm slightly poor when it comes to creative intelligence. I feel that some people with low IQ can still succeed in school and life since IQ doesn't really measure creative or practical intelligence very well (although all three or two of the three are required in order to succeed in life and school). I have a feeling that their are people with high IQ's (analytical intelligence) that struggle with creative and practical intelligence so much that people would think that they're slow and stupid. Their are people with lower or average IQ's that have really good creative or practical intelligence, so they're often seen as smart.\n\nSo don't give up hope all because you have a low IQ (even if the low IQ is your potential), unless you're in the small % of people (Out of the entire world) whose actually intellectually disabled or borderline disabled (less than 75). An 80-85 IQ is enough to make it through college(especially if they have high creative and practical intelligence and are good with working memory and attention), but they would have to work harder.\n\nSo a low IQ doesn't necessarily mean that you're a slow thinker in general (lots of cognitive abilities that aren't measured in an IQ test that you might have).\nAnimedjinn: IQ is actually a complete fabrication. It was made to separate the races and doesn't even have a consistent measurement technique.\nLolbotkiller: How are you to seperaten humanity?\n\n\nWe all are one Race\nAnimedjinn: One of the original purposes of IQ tests was to test your knowledge of wealthy white culture. The test was purposely made to test knowledge of things that people who lived in poor and/or black neighborhood wouldn't know.\nLolbotkiller: Ahhh thats what you mean.\n\n\nSorry, but thats ethnicity, Not race\nAnimedjinn: In the US, race refers to skin color, and ethnicity refers to your heritage\nLolbotkiller: Oof.\n\n\nI See humanity as one Race (homo sapiens, even If some act Like neanderthals sometimes) \n\n\nWith multiple ethnicities, which can be subdivided into subethnicities (Lack of Word).\n\nEthnicities: \n\nAsian\nLatino / Hispanic\nEuropean / North American /  Oceania\nAfrican\n\nThese can then be subdivided into say slavs, Chinese, Filipino etc, but NOT into countries.

{"full_text": "cjacksteel: Tank not refilling in Reverse Osmosis system\nI have a Whirlpool WHER25 reverse osmosis system that was already in the house when we moved in.\n\nI expected pretty low maintenance and replaced the pre/post filters in March after they hit the one year mark. Then, in May, the pressure declined to unusable. Seeing the tank was still full, I figured the bladder may have become depressurized or ruptured. It seemed like it didn't take air from my pump, so I replaced with a new 4 gallon tank. The tank arrives and will not fill even after several days. I checked the pressure, etc. and am finding maybe the membrane is bad. The membrane is only a year old, but I ordered a new one and installed it. I was pleased to see, things started filling up right away with the new membrane!\n\nHowever, after seemingly one fill of the tank from the new membrane, the tank is no longer filling again. Water pressure has dipped very low and the tank is very light. I am kind of out of things to replace, so I am not sure where to go from here. The house water pressure \\_seems\\_ fine, but I am not sure how to test this nor do I think anything has changed with that (at least in a way that is noticeable at any other fixture).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: No water pressure, empty tank even though I have replaced the pre/post filters in March and the membrane and tank in May and even though it filled up once and worked great for a few days after getting a new membrane.\nvigg-o-rama: without knowing your entire system, I am going to make a stab in the dark here...\n\nYou likely have a permeate pump.  This pump works off the waste water discharge to boost the output pressure.  it is effectively a mini turbo for water.  an RO membrane doesn't work well with backpressure.  AS the under the sink tank has a bladder in it, each drop of water that goes into the tank puts more back pressure on the RO unit.  it can equalize to your water input pressure and cause a no flow type situation.\n\ndid you notice any changes to your house water pressure?  maybe its not coming into your house with as much pressure as before?  do you have any PSI or TDS meters on the RO unit?  a picture of the whole setup would go a long ways here.  there are so many different ways to setup an RO, but only a few  correct ways ;)  so pics would really help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAS an FYI - you should think about getting some pressure and TDS meters.  these will help you know when the change filters.  prefilters and carbon filters will need different replacement dates, and the membrane will last until it doesn't. lol.  but you only know this from checking the TDS of the water pre and post membrane to do a little math to calculate its efficiency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am happy to explain all of that if you are interested, but its a lot to type up if you dont really care.\ncjacksteel: Thanks for your detailed response. We really havent' seen any noticeable change in pressure anywhere (faucets, showers, hoses all seem the same). I will look into the meters, I am trying to better understand this whole system as it's something I never had before moving to this house and figured just keeping up with filter replacements was about all it'd need to keep going.\n\nHere are a few pics I took: https://imgur.com/a/yontwnS\nIt's in the basement directly below the kitchen sink. As mentioned prior, it worked for the 9 months we owned this house until May. Strangely, it worked just fine for the first tank fill after the membrane was replaced, but now does not want to fill the tank again.\nvigg-o-rama: nice. thanks for the pics! that really does help some.\n\nso what i see here is a very proprietary system.  I looked over the manual ,and this is not normal!  they do some strange things in that housing.  anyways... I had typed up a lot of info, then realized it was all pretty much worthless based on this systems design.  I am not going to tell you its crap, but i would say that if you REALLY like having RO Water at the sink, and have a few hundred bucks laying around, you might think about building a \"generic\" system that will use MUCH cheaper cartridges, as well as the right number of filters to keep that membrane going for a lot longer and likely cheaper replacement costs on the membrane as well.  I would be willing to bet that 10 years of replacement filters for that unit will more than pay for an entirely new system and a few years of its filters.\n\nI do see one thing in the manual that might help.  do you have a tire pressure guage? or some way to get the PSI on the bladder tank when its emtpy?  they state it should be between 5and 7 psi when empty.\n\nin their troubleshooting guide at the end it says :\n\n**system makes lower amount of product water than usual:**\n\n**Cause**: storage tank air charge less than 5-7psi\n\n**correction**: open RO faucet and drain tank until its a drip, keep faucet open and check tank pressure, if low, pressurize to 6psi.  close faucet to refill the tank.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit : and i re-read your OP and see you have done this already.  I would suspect something in the controls under the hood of that crazy setup.  sadly, my honest opinion would be to replace that unit with something that uses standard 10\" cartridges and build a 4 stage setup (1 prefilter, 2X carbon, and 1 RO).  probably around a $250-300 investment after you add a permeate pump and a shutoff valve.\n\nA [system like this](https://www.bulkreefsupply.com/brs-4-stage-ro-only-system-75gpd-2.html) would be almost a drop in replacment.. I use a similar design (although i also use a deionizer stage) and find the prefilters last me about 6 months, the carbons last over a year and my mebrane is at 3 years and still at a 98% rejection rate.)  I make 15-20 gallons a week with my unit.  the prefilters are 5 bucks and carbon filters are 15 bucks that will treat chloromines as well as chlorine.  I have REALLY BAD WATER so you may get double the life out of cartridges that I do.\ncjacksteel: Really appreciate your time on this! I, too, have pored over the manual. This seemed like a pretty cheap/entry level system, so I was not expecting it to be so much trouble. We like the RO setup more or less. Do you have a generic you'd recommend? Would it be something I, without any plumbing experience could set up? (I'd re-use the saddle valve and faucet at the sink ideally, so it seems like the rest would just be push connectors and drilling a few holes in the wall to mount it).\n\nTo your suggestion on the tank, that is kind of where this all started. I had a full tank but no pressure and it seemed like the bladder had failed. The date on the tank was something like 2003 so it seemed time to replace the tank. So, the tank I am using is brand new and appears to be pressurized in the 5-7 range when I got it.\n\nThe strangest thing to me is replacing the tank and membrane resulted in exactly one tankful of water. Since then, it has refused to replenish.\n\nEDIT: Just saw your edit above and you linked a good replacement. I will check this out, thanks so much for all your help!\nvigg-o-rama: I maintain Reef Aquariums at home, so I have had a unit for about 30 years and believe it or not, I am using most of the original unit I bought 30 years ago.  the one i linked you to, while its out of stock, is the right unit for drinking water. you do NOT want to add a deionizer to your system for drinking water.  its bad for humans to drink 0 TDS water. they have some other drinking water kits, but they all come with tanks and taps, you already have those!  so save some bucks and just get the RO unit.\n\nyou might get away wtih only 1 carbon block (3 stage unit) but you should call your water company and ask if they use chlorine or chloromines.  chlorine only requires a 3 stage (1 prefilter, 1 carbon, 1 ro membrane) but a lot of water municipalities are upgrading to chloromines and it will likely become industry standard in the next decade so might as well go for 4 stage unit ((1 prefilter, 2 carbon, 1 ro membrane)\n\n  it looks like you have some 3/8 or 1/2\" tubing in that setup you have now, and the one i linked is all 1/4\" tubing, so you may just need some [adapters](https://reverseosmosis.com/products/john-guest-3-8-qc-x-1-4-qc-union-reducing-connector?variant=1036588548123&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;cmp_id=1445538175&amp;adg_id=57124379515&amp;kwd=&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3MjCsLbX6QIVxkXVCh2RXAvsEAQYAyABEgIjnPD_BwE) for that.\n\nYou would also want to think about an [autoshutoff valve](https://www.bulkreefsupply.com/1-4-auto-shut-off-valve.html) for starters and likely the [permeate pump](https://www.bulkreefsupply.com/aquatec-permeate-pump-erp-1000-with-clip.html) so you dont put too much back pressure on the membrane. the auto shut off valve will sense when the tank is full and then shutdown the input side of the RO unit.  you dont want these things under water pressure all the time.  its just going to wear out the membrane faster.\n\nI do think its something that a non plumber can do.  I know that the site i linked, as well as most other RO retailers will work with you on some basic design ideas to ensure you buy the right thing. and in your case, you have the harder parts dealt with (saddle valve, drain tube placement, etc)  all the plumbing for this is just push to fit connectors.  they are really easy to use ,and 99% of the time you have a leak, its just that the tube is not fully pushed in.\n\nmy original unit is a spectrapure brand, but at this point, its half parts from BulkReefSupply that are added onto it.  such as a [TDS meter](https://www.bulkreefsupply.com/triple-inline-tds-meter-trm-1-hm-digital.html) that shows me how pure the water is getting at different stages.  I also use a [pressure guage](https://www.bulkreefsupply.com/glycerin-filled-pressure-gauge-1-100-psi.html) right before my RO membrane (after the carbon blocks) to see how clogged the carbon are getting.  the spectrapure is a GREAT brand, but a little pricey.  you can probably find a unit cheaper than BRS, but I buy there as they are pretty cheap over all, so look around, but basically that unit i linked is the same style you would want from anywhere.\n\nthe idea here is to use tools to really tell you when things need to be replaced instead of buying $25 sets of cartridges every 6 months with the system you have now.  you never know if they are really depleated or not!\n\nanother reason to love these generic systems is its that its easy to add on to them as needed.  I used to only use 1 carbon block, but my city changed to using chloromines that require 2 carbon blocks to remove, it was simple to rebuilt my unit and just add on an extra stage.  \n\nYou probably dont need the TDS meter, pressure guages or permeate pump to get started.  you likely could just drop that system in place wtih some press-fit adapters for 3/8 or 1/2 (whatever you have now) to get to the 1/4 input (same as your clear tube that i think goes to your spigot at the sink).\n\nyou can get most of these filters are HD or lowes, but i would buy them online to get a better price.  amazon will have all of the filters... standard 10\" cartridges... again, i get mine from BRS as I buy DI resin from them but you dont need to worry about that resin.\n\nI aprecate that you are actually interested in learning about these systems. i totally geek out on the idea of making chemically pure water.  its not my job, but its interesting enough i guess?\n\ngood luck! and ask more questions if you are interested.\ncjacksteel: For something available now, what do you think of this well-rated setup? https://smile.amazon.com/APEC-Water-Systems-RO-90-Certified/dp/B00HRHHFPW/ref=sr_1_10?crid=3I7W9W9LXEIX0&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=reverse+osmosis+system&amp;qid=1590754732&amp;sprefix=reverse+o%2Caps%2C313&amp;sr=8-10\n\nA little more expensive and I know the 5 stage may be a bit overkill, but seems like it'd be pretty plug and play with my setup plus has auto shutoff valve out of the box: https://imgur.com/3yyXcdY\nvigg-o-rama: ok that would totally work for you.  the 5th stage is not a DI stage, its just another carbon for taste, so it would actually be really nice.  the cartridges all look standard except the 5th stage, you may have to buy that one specific for the model, but the rest is pretty generic.  yeah, that would pretty much drop right in place of what you have.  \n\nyou would only really need the adapters for the tubing you have to the tubing this uses, and i think you have one of those already, where the blue line converts to the 1/4\" clear line in your current setup.  you would need a few of those.  \n\nclose the saddle valve, cut all the lines, use connectors to splice this new unit in, open the saddle valve.  done.\n\nthe key is that its standardized hardware.  now you can just use it, or if you get geeky with it, you can add on meters.  the ONLY thing I dont like about it is the opaque housings.  I like to see whats going on inside my system, but that is a minor thing really, and you could buy clear replacement housings if it matters to you ,but it likely doesnt :)\ncjacksteel: Cool, thanks for giving it a look! I did reach out to BRS to see if they have an ETA on the kit you linked... if it's soonish I will wait for that, but dont' want to go too long without having a functional setup, plus I am home all the time right now to do the install.\nvigg-o-rama: meh, its the same price really.  you dont NEED the bladder tank or sink filler, but this setup you linked to, would be a drop in replacement.  the one i linked you to, you might need to do a little planning.. i say that because you have a 4 hose setup and the one you linked to also has that same 4 hose setup.  I dont really understand what they are doing there, but really this one you found might be an easier drop in replace type thing.\ncjacksteel: Update! The APEC system was received last night and I installed (very early) this morning. It's filling now but seems to be operating as expected, and with a vigor I never saw from the old system (I can see the water pumping through the lines and watch it 'pump' through the system). I am waiting on any picture, as I wanted to make sure it's working 100% and then take it down to do whatever the plumbing equivalent of 'cable management' is as well as drill lag bolts into the block wall behind it (the old system was much smaller and held up with surprisingly tiny screws in anchors).\n\nAlso, I don't wind up needing the 1/4x3/8 adapter long-term... a 1/4x1/4 will actually be better and allow me to eliminate some superfluous tubing. I'll make that change when I take it off the wall after a bit of steady operation.\n\nOverall, I am thrilled with the quality for the price and the install couldn't have been easier... truly 'drop-in' replacement (though I did take the chance to use new tubing wherever possible because why not). Thanks so much for all your help throughout this process. Next up, an in-line tds meter!\nvigg-o-rama: Dude, thank you so much for the follow up and I am looking forward to the pics.  It\u2019s refreshing to see someone actually have some feedback and follow up on a topic like this.  Awesome!\ncjacksteel: Here are the promised 'finished' shots... how did I do? Also decided to add in the fridge ice maker, which is something I wanted to do anyway.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PGHRE0D\nvigg-o-rama: AWESOME!\n\nso glad to see you used the little red clips too ;)\ncjacksteel: Yeah, strangely the ice maker kit came with them, but the RO system itself did not, even though they are both made by APEC.

{"full_text": "OfficiallyKeval: Screens Kill Your Reading Comprehension. Here's How to Fix Them.\nI need five minutes to make my case. I can\u2019t do it in less than that. If you want to leave now, go ahead - I won\u2019t be offended - but if you can summon the strength to stick with me, I can make it much, much easier for you to concentrate on everything else you read today, and maybe for the rest of your life.\n\nIf you have five minutes for that - a real, serious five minutes - then step into my lair.\n\nI say \u201ceverything else you read today\u201d because the article is tailored to screens, and odds are excellent that any reading you do today will happen on a screen. Unfortunately, pretty much every study out there has found that screens (be they computer, tablet or phone) are less effective reading instruments than paper. Our brains don\u2019t come naturally wired for reading, since written language is a man-made construct not otherwise found in our environment, thus the brain has to adapt preexisting circuitry to the task. And paper, comparatively speaking, is a more natural material than a Kindle.\n\nPlus, conditioning. If you were born in the twentieth century, your circuitry adapted to paper before it ever came across a screen. And on paper, you can expect a certain linearity. No hyperlinks allowed. There's a set beginning, a set ending; between the two is a set number of ideas, and they\u2019re expressed in a set format. Your brain can look at paper, create a mental blueprint for it in a matter of seconds, and then focus all of its power into absorbing the information on the page.\n\nNot so with screens. For starters, light reflects differently, even on a Kindle Voyage. The brain lacks a physical object to help it perform that split-second blueprinting. And thanks to all of that time you've spent clicking from page to page, your brain is wasting a huge chunk of its concentration on looking for and anticipating the next switch. When you\u2019re on Facebook, it\u2019s waiting for The New York Times. On The New York Times, it\u2019s waiting for CNN. On CNN, it\u2019s waiting for Buzzfeed. On Buzzfeed, it\u2019s waiting for Wait But Why. These factors, when combined, can make it a Herculean effort to get anything out of what you're trying to read (how much can you remember of what you read yesterday?).\n\nTherein lies the problem. We need screens for quick information transfers, but they suck as a medium for learning. We\u2019d be better at our jobs if we could concentrate more effectively (read: use paper), but our jobs require that we use suboptimal workstations. We need a middle ground, a way to have our oasis and eat it too.\n\nThis is especially important for me, because my job at Thought entails taking in massive quantities of academic studies so I can apply them to the courses we\u2019re designing. It\u2019s even more important at the moment, since I\u2019m working on a \u201cmeta-course\u201d that needs to improve our students\u2019 abilities to learn online [(here\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about)]( http://gothought.com/meta-course/). Thing is, all these studies are - you guessed it - online, which means I\u2019m reading them on my MacBook.\n\nI needed a workaround. So I made one. And you can use it too. It\u2019s a three-step process that brings your screen a lot closer to resembling paper, and makes it way easier to concentrate when you need to. It\u2019s free, because I had to piece it together on a budget.\n\n**Step One:** Lighting. I wanted to bring my workstation as close as I could to conditions that would reasonably be found in nature. First and foremost, this meant adjusting my screen to mimic natural light. I did some digging for an application that can do this, and there was a good one already available. It\u2019s called f.lux. Installing it and typing in your zip code will let it approximate your longitude and latitude, which it uses to change your screen\u2019s lighting minute-to-minute. If you\u2019re in DC on a cloudy day, the light will look like that. If you\u2019re in LA and it\u2019s pouring rain (not likely but we can dream), it knows that too. You can, quite literally, set it and forget it.\n\nIn addition to f.lux, I also tweaked the natural lighting around my workstation. I moved as close to a window as I could, removed all artificial-looking lights such as fluorescents, and replaced them with one (and only one) soft light, which was a floor lamp using a GE Reveal light bulb.\n\n(On a less immediately relevant but still important note, I then took three minutes and cleaned my desk to keep extraneous items out of my line of sight while reading. I find that clutter distracts me and creates a sense of slothfulness which seeps into the work. If your area is cluttered and you don\u2019t think it\u2019s changing anything, it\u2019s probably because the negative effects have become the norm, and you\u2019ve adapted to them instead of making the environment adapt to you.)\n\n**Step Two:** Mimicking a physical object. The reason a book or piece of paper is so much easier for the brain to interpret is that it\u2019s simple to evaluate when it comes into view. The book's weight gives a rough sense of the text\u2019s length, you can flip through the pages quickly, and you more or less know what the formatting will be like before you start reading. Contrast this with online articles, which convey maybe one out of three of these benefits.\n\nI began copying the full text of the article and pasting it into a Google Doc. Once I\u2019d cleared up the extra spacing and other copy-paste glitches, I changed the font to Georgia (Georgia and Verdana are the two fonts most well-designed for screens), increased its size to my liking, then skimmed through and broke up the text into three or four lines at a time. Shorter paragraphs are easier for the brain to retain, as they make for more natural eye movement.\n\nAfter I finished, I saved the text to a PDF and enabled two-page view. I zoomed out as far as I could go while still being able to see the words and performed one more skim, which now mimicked the effect of flipping through a physical book. Two pages at a time and a bird\u2019s-eye view of the whole document - this let me see just how large the text was and where the formatting changes were. Three minutes later I went back to the beginning, now with an improved understanding of what I was about to read.\n\n**Step Three:** Creating linearity (also known as eliminating distractions). Even if you have excellent lighting and textual formatting, your conditioning still wants you to navigate elsewhere when you\u2019re on a screen. I couldn\u2019t change this fully (that\u2019s a much longer process), but I could put some roadblocks up.\n\nI located and downloaded an open-source application called SelfControl. Its purpose? To cut off my Internet access for the period of time during which I\u2019m reading, and to do it in such a way that I can\u2019t reverse it if I weaken. To use it, you input the domain names you want it to block (Facebook or Twitter), tell it how long to block them for, and your computer becomes unable to go to them until the time has elapsed. If you try, your browser will just display an error screen. This works even if you reboot the computer: no soup for you until 5:01 pm.\n\nThree steps, maybe ten minutes of effort. And just like that, I had my oasis.\n\nSee you there.\n\n\nEDIT: Nymphosymphony created a really good TL;DR for this post that I'm sure many of you will benefit from.\n\n\n**tl;dr :** Even though reading is a human construct that we've only had since ~4000 B.C.E., we adapted to reading things on physical media like paper or clay tablets.

So many people don't listen. With your horizontal rows, are your legs straight or bent?

As the weight comes off, strength progress will speed up. \n\nA trick I like for teaching my stomach not to think it's hungry is to chug a good 15-20 ounces of water before eating something if I feel snacky.

Oh, I guess you shouldn't get it on your exposed spinal cord too, according to the bottle. That shouldn't be an issue unless you regularly perform spinal column surgery in the shower. You're not supposed to rub your genitals or anus with it either. Mucus membranes in general. Just read the bottle. It's been used for over 60 years and it's pretty darn safe unless you're an idiot.\n3. I rinse it off, turn off the shower, and dry like normal. Don't soap up after you use it as it can deactivate the antiseptic.\n4. Then, I put on my clothes, skipping deodorant/antiperspirant unless I'm doing something like wearing a suit all day in warm weather. This makes your sweat not stink as much, not prevent you from sweating. You can probably figure it out from there.\n5. Get your submission ripped apart on /r/lifehacks as is tradition.

If everyone who ran the world had worked at olive garden on weekend nights for a month the world would run so fucking well.\n[deleted]: I would like all you morons to know I ran a god damned food truck for eight years. The service industry does not provide the profit margin to support a family, not anymore at least. Everyone should have to work in the service industry as a teenager, but they need to get out quick. You can\u2019t expect benefits or a salary from it, it\u2019s not going to happen. Mcdonalds pay is for people who don\u2019t pay bills, and want spending money after school. If you want to make a career out of it, entrepreneurship is your only option, and I knew enough about the industry to run away from that and shift laterally into another career.\n\n\nOh, and if the service industry is the epitome of real jobs, running a food truck is the epitome of the service industry.

So coming back to my comment a few days later, idc who sees it. This has to be said. Fuck anyone who thinks I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, McDonalds is 1,000 times easier than what I did for the better part of a decade.\n\nLast edit. I saw the numbers. I know the profit margin. I\u2019m not a wishful idiot, I want a family, a house and benefits. Complaining isn\u2019t going to get me that. So do what you need to do for yourself.

{"full_text": "HE-MAN69WOO: The meaning of life\nI would like to first start off and say that i thought of this awhile ago when i was just about to go to bed. Anyways,I personally believe the meaning of life is to be yourself. How i got to this conclusion is that i was pondering on the idea of tabula rosa and was thinking that if we come out of the womb as neither good nor bad, isn't that newborn a Taoist? Meaning, isn't that newborn in a state of pure naturalness where it neither wants to gain nor loose anything? It comes out with a sense of nothing and is only taught silently how to breathe, which ultimately counteracts the bringing of death. It is silently taught how to laugh, smile, have emotions, ect. by just being itself. Well when we ask a question like, \"Why are we here?\" we must answer it rhetorically to get the full idea out of it. So instead we say, \"why are we not here?\" well good question. why are we not over there, or under here? because if we wanted to be over there, we would have to walk.Once we are there, we can answer the question why we are here simply with \"because we walked.\" Because we did, do, will always do, and always have been doing it. Life is happening and why we are here is because we have been a product of life. Our main reason that we are here is that we are life, and we have walked, talked, sat, ate, discussed, and breathed our way into a divine blossom we call life today. And what you personally do with that life is up to you, and once you discover what you like to do, then you have reached your own second tabula rosa. Neither will you want to gain nor loose, and you will be comfortable where you sit. How do you figure out what yourself is? You don't, and by that you figure out what yourself is. You continue with your day trying to be the best you can and you will find that one day, you have become what you always wanted. Sounds very cheesy I know, but it makes the most sense to me. Any input on this theory would be helpful. \nakhoSS: The meaning of life.. Oh what a question to be asked. Well congratulations on reaching the most commonly held view point ever - \"life is up to you\". It certainly is, that's why everyone is ranting about free will. \nNow, I see a problem with the question and the answer. You ask for the 'meaning of life', but you subtly imply in your answer that the question you're considering is 'what is the purpose of life'. These are two different things - the former implies a posteriori, the latter, a priori explanation. The former expresses meanings - these can only be acquired through some being 'being a limited being'.(wow English sucks at expressing notion of Sein). If you consider meanings, you deal with how certain beings that are capable of judgments (esp. value judgments) interpret the world outside as much as the world inside them. This means that all meanings are essentially derived from experience - take happiness for instance, Kant, to jog my memory, explains it as the sum of all satisfactions (or so). It is entirely a posteriori concept that has no meaning without a being coming into existence. \nThe latter, namely purpose, is a teleological notion. This implies that each being has some purpose to which he adheres. A purpose to life means a purpose and then life. That life springs either in accordance with a grand purpose, or that each life that springs carries with it a purpose. Now of course, some say that certain beings have certain purposes codified in them in accordance to some deterministic laws. The difference is that some beings possess a free will and some do not - those that do not, we assume, are guided by natural instincts (latest interpretation of these being Darwinism) and those who do, do no adhere to any principles apart their own.\nUnless you accept that all that happens is necessary, then you are rendered to accept some form of free will that abolishes the possibility of teleologism. \nFurthermore, I take it it's time to point out certain absurdities. Now, life is not an action, not a thing - it is the totality of all that is. It is a positive, not a normative definition of life. Sure you can give meanings to it that you derive from experience (life's a journey or something alike) but I've already explained the concept of 'meaning'. If you compare life to any action within, you're bound to fail for you, in all cases, presume life. That's just fallacious reasoning. \nAnother important distinction, reasons and causes are two different things. A reason is a gateway for a volition. A cause must necessarily be followed by an effect. One expresses a mental phenomena of free will; the other natural determinism. We have no reasons to be living in general for reasons come only after existence, after life starts, as to say.\nI'd continue on all the inaccuracies but it's getting tiring.\nflyinghamsta: very.... german ; )\n", "prompt": "HE-MAN69WOO: The meaning of life\nI would like to first start off and say that i thought of this awhile ago when i was just about to go to bed.

{"full_text": "ColdBoreShooter: Finally found the urge to train again after a week-long hiatus.\nNormally I'm training 6 days a week. Last week, I think the election coverage just sapped any motivation I had left. It's been a really rough time lately. I've been unemployed for over a month and getting lots of interviews but no offers yet. Things with the girlfriend have been bad and it's really hurt my outlook. Money is tight and up until Saturday my roommate and I had been unsuccessfully looking for a new tenant. Well now the election is decided, we have a new roommate, I had two promising interviews today and several scheduled for this week, and my girlfriend and I are gonna try to heal things tonight. So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first step. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started by doing a bridge hold and trying to push my stomach as high in the air as possible. I'm not particularly flexible and my bridge kind of sucks, so I think it's important to keep stretching those muscles to get that synovial fluid in there. Followed up with a few L-Holds, and I was surprised to discover that I can actually hold my legs out almost straight with my butt almost completely off the ground for a couple seconds before collapsing. Couldn't even get my butt off the ground at all a few months ago. I rounded out the stretches with some twist holds and amazingly I can actually lock my hands behind my back on my right side. Left side is still pretty tight but I'm seeing slow progress with a hand towel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to pushups. I started with just a few conventional pushups to get the blood circulating, and then a few close pushups. I migrated to one of the beer die tables in the backyard and did a few one-arm incline pushups with legs apart at first, then together. Legs together is so much fucking harder it's not even funny, even with such a steep incline. I can feel my feet slipping from underneath me. I'm trying so hard to not rotate my torso when coming back up, and I'm trying to avoid splaying my elbows. Left arm is having a hell of a time keeping up with the right. I transitioned to the ground for some slow and steady close pushups. I've stopped counting and recording reps like I used to, I just go until it hurts but before failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext were leg raises. Started out on the ground with straight legs, and the next set I moved to the bar. Hanging leg raises are a lot harder for me because I feel more of a strain in my quads, and I tend to swing a little. I tried keeping my core flexed and tight the whole time to avoid swinging, but at this point I feel like I can get my muscles burning more on my back because my stamina is so much less while hanging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, grip training. Started with some clenched eagle claws, then 2 sets of 5 fingertip pushups to work the tops of the fingers. I did a few hangs from the bar to warm up, and then started some towel hangs. Jesus, is my endurance lower with the towel, and it's not even a thick one. But if I can get up to 30 seconds with the towel I'll be pretty happy with that, as I can do about a minute on the bar. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was it for the day. I went in, made my 1 giant meal for the day, started my fasting timer, and I'll try to hop on the stationary bike later tonight. Just thought I'd share this momentous day of getting off my ass and doing the right thing for a change. I'll keep going this whole week and stop being a lazy fuck. Thank you to this sub for keeping me mostly motivated throughout these many months. Cheers.\n5sav1age9: A week off can actually be really good for you and just what you need.

One of your close friends is literally married and you dont even know his wife? \n\nSo, one of the ideas that seems most likely to me is that OP is simply from a country where that is the cultural norm.

But referring to the recently released sworn depositions, we now know that Clapper, Brennan, Comey, Farkas, and Rice (there's more, just can't remember them off the top of my head) had no direct evidence to tie the Trump campaign to Russia....or all of them lied about that under oath.\nMartin_Samuelson: Yes, there was credible evidence that suggested a crime took place and they investigated it. In the end, they didn\u2019t find enough direct evidence, in part because numerous people they investigated lied and obstructed justice. \n\nI\u2019m really struggling to see your point here as it makes no logical sense.\nreelBIGfish: And that crime you mention was what again....?\nMartin_Samuelson: Russian interference into the 2016 election including hacking and stealing DNC documents, assisted by members of the Trump campaign including Michael Flynn. This is all well-reported in the media and detailed in the Mueller report.\n\nYou know when you play dumb you just sound \u2026 dumb.\nreelBIGfish: So now that previously classified sworn testimony from Clapper, Brennan, Rice, and Farkas has been publically released in which they state they had no evidence to link election meddling Russians to the Trump campaign ever happened... are you saying they were lying under oath in those closed door hearings? Or are they telling the truth under oath?\n\nAlso, are you saying the head of Crowdstrike (who was also under oath) actually had direct evidence the Russians hacked the DNC? Because he says otherwise under oath.\n\nAlso, (I forget who under oath) said that no requests were made for the DNC servers while Jim Comey said (under oath) that multiple requests were made at multiple levels. \n\nI suggest you start reading the trove of sworn depositions that was just released.\nMartin_Samuelson: Here, let me give you a simpler example. Me and a group of friends all commit a crime. We lie, obstruct, and otherwise destroy all direct evidence that the crime was committed. The FBI catches us obstructing, but because we destroyed all direct evidence they can\u2019t prosecute us.\n\nYou\u2019re argument is that the FBI can\u2019t then charge us for lying and obstructing because they don\u2019t have the evidence that we committed a crime! That\u2019s some real catch-22 nonsense.\nreelBIGfish: That's not my argument at all.  Flynn was charged with making false statements to the FBI.  That charge requires 3 things the government must prove.\n\n1. The lie was materially relevant to the criminal investigation\n2. The lie was done knowingly\n3. The government has jurisdiction over the crime\n\nThis is the law. These are facts, not opinions.\n\nI'm not debating 2 and 3 - he says he lied and the government does have jurisdiction to investigate.\n\nThe DOJ is now saying that there were issues with #1.  His lies weren't materially relevant to a legitimate investigation.  \n\nThat is the situation as presented by the DOJ currently.  All facts. \n\nThe legal reasoning behind dropping the charge is now because the previously closed door testimony is now public.  There are numerous public officials saying that they had no evidence that Trump or his campaign were colluding with Russia. \n\nIf the DOJ wants to pursue the charges against Flynn that means everyone (Brennan, Clapper, Rice, Farkas) would be hauled in for perjury.\n\n\nAgain, you haven't answered my question about what crime the FBI was investigating.  You mentioned \"reasonable suspicion,\" but can you tell me from where that reasonable suspicion came from when (under oath) numerous governmental officials stated that there was no evidence to make a Russian link?\n\nThese people have been lying to the public and presumably telling the truth under oath and saying two polar opposite stories. What don't you get about that? They've lied to the media and told the truth under oath (presumably).\nMartin_Samuelson: &gt;\t1. The lie was materially relevant to the criminal investigation\n\n&gt;\tThe DOJ is now saying that there were issues with #1. His lies weren't materially relevant to a legitimate investigation.\n\nThat argument doesn\u2019t actually address #1, which is why everyone who isn\u2019t corrupt or biased thinks this is nonsense. \n\n&gt;\tYou mentioned \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d but can you tell me from where that reasonable suspicion came from when (under oath) numerous governmental officials stated that there was no evidence to make a Russian link?\n\n\u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d and \u201cdirect evidence\u201d are two different things. It literally the point of investigations to start with reasonable suspicion and then go and collect direct evidence.\n\nAgain, the widely-reported details in the Mueller report explain why there was reasonable suspicion and strong circumstantial evidence that Trump associates committed crimes. The fact that they never found \u201cdirect evidence\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t a legitimate investigation.\n\nSo you\u2019ve got another nonsensical catch-22 argument.

{"full_text": "BroodingBatman: How I view life as of this moment.\nWhere do I start with this post? \n\nI'm currently 25 years old. I don't really have friendships to speak up and admittedly, have never been kissed, still have the V card, and never had a girlfriend. \n\nLong story short, was never the type to make friends in my upbringing. So by the time high school came, I didn't really participate in the social aspects of it. I admit it. My mother has played a dominating presence in my life. \n\nFinancials greatly impacted my college experience. I really wanted to move out for my college experience. I and my mother had intense arguments but ultimately there wasn't anything I could do. So I lived at home through my college years. Been working and living at home ever since. I have never moved out until now. \n\nLooking back, I was greatly naive on just how expensive college was. I have come to understand where my mother was coming from. I can't help however but resent everything how it went down. To this day, I still desire the college experience I never got to have. But the person I hate the most is in fact me. I should have worked harder in high school. I wish I was more aware. Maybe I could have gotten a scholarship at UCLA or another UC and used that to my leverage to force my mom's hand. \n\nI'm 25 now but lacking the social moments that my peers my age have already had already. To put it short, I'm the book on the shelf that is covered in dust. I am in fact 18 years old in my own mind.\n\nIt's taken a while but I've come to accept that I will never have the college experience I desired nor is my adolescence or early 20's gonna come back. But I will not lie and say I don't really like what's potentially in front of me. \n\nPeople my age are busier are now. Their social groups are closed and even if you happen to find a social group of people my age, I'll feel like I'll be the least important member of the group as I came in so late. Whatever friend I make at this point, I just can't but be unsatisfied. I admit it's shallow but even if I find that one rare good friend, I can't help but see that we're all adults now. The biggest of all, despite sometime left, marriage and children are something that is beginning to loom. I will most likely never have a period in my life where my friends can be just that. My friends. Without the whole stupid cycle of returning to suburbia. \n\nIf it was up to me. Yes. Every single person in my friend group would be around 18 to 20. Same thing goes for my romantic relationships. But I also recognize that chances of having relationships like this are low and society will hate me for it. My only defense is, having friends of that age and being romantically involved with someone that age is just better suited for my maturity and is more practical for the long term. To the women my age, I'm sorry. But marriage and children is something I won't be ready for until my early 40's at the very latest, and that's only if I get lucky. I am not all out on marriage and children, but this societal pressure scares me.\n\nI resent the fact that people my age are practically my pool for human connection. Even though it is never coming back, being an adolescent is still something I want. Social interaction at this age just feels so different and I don't like it. My adolescence is something that is always going to be unfulfilled. \n\nEven though I don't think someone you only see once in three weeks is really your friend, adult friendships are all that I have. \n\nI have thought about my long-term goal of moving to France but like I posted here, socially what would it give? The more I get older, the fewer people want friends especially as an English-speaking foreigner. I still lean towards pursuing this goal only because of potential EU citizenship. Socially, however, the social rewards would not be as fruitful as I didn't reach France till older age. In actuality, I expect no reward at all other than becoming a French citizen.\n\nIn summary, I have given up on friendship, finding a partner, and human connection in general. It's kinda too late for me.\n\nEven though I vastly overshared on this post, I can't help but feel empty. I attempted suicide just nearly one year ago today. My family still doesn't know that I tried to drown myself in San Francisco. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to do it again. Maybe in Europe this time. \n\nThere's a part of me that wants out. Whether it's out of America or out of life.\n\nI apologize for such a long post.\nadyuma: Hey bro. \n\nLook, I went through a similar experience where I didnt get to experience too much of the typical college life because I was financially burdened and literally worked 16 hours a day to make ends meet and pay for my Uni fees (I was an international student in a Western country so no loans). \n\nAnyways so I thought when I turned 23 that its too late, I've gone past the point of having all that fun. Then I thought the same at 25, thinking man I could have started working on some aspects at 23 and life would be better now, and beat myself up for not taking the initiative then. And guess what, at 27 I thought the same too.\n\nThats when I realized that shit doesnt happen like in the movies, there's no coming together of things, stuff doesnt magically fall into place on its own. I always had the belief that things would work out one day, ans I lost that attitude and thought to myself that if i live till 70 (hopefully that, or more), I've really gone through only 20-30% of my life. \n\nSo then I've started proactively started doing what I've wanted to do, defy yourself and really anything here in this world is achievable if you put your heart to it (and WANT to put in the effort for it). \n\nPeople in their late 20s early 30s are still kids at heart with more responsibilities, people still want to make friends, hang out, just that they cant do it all the time cuz they've got stuff to handle. And same goes with you too, but I guarantee you there's loads of people out there that will be great friends, you gotta put yourself out there tho.\nBroodingBatman: You had me there until you validated that people our age have less time. To have friendships you must have time.\n\nPeople our age have less time as we get older.\n\nYou only proved my points even further. Human connection ain't worth it going forward. Do I sound like the type that wants to be cancelled at the last second? \n\nI ain't tolerating that shit.\nadyuma: You got me wrong bro, people make time but not for every single person. \n\nLike when I was 20 I could spend a whole day with a friend doing nothing, chilling. Now I got stuff to do so I'll spend time with a friend but I've got to get my stuff done too like work, sleep, etc. \n\nIf I'm having a really good time you sacrifice on sleep/work as well. \n\nPeople have time but are you expecting them to give you their life 24/7?\nBroodingBatman: 24/7? No. But do I want it the way it was like when I was a teenager? Absolutely.\n\nThe responsibility kills any joy I have for adult friendships. In addition to the constant nagging of wanting marriage and kids and knowing it's on the horizon for many. \n\nThere's a lot of limitations too. I know if I were to go to a rave a person my age wouldn't last as long.\n\nEverything is ultra planned. There's no having fun on a whim. I truly dislike people my age and would rather not waste my time. It ain't worth the hassle of people constantly backing out of plans.\nadyuma: So what exactly do you mean like when you were a teenager? Whats the difference now? That people have responsibilities? \n\nAnd who's nagging you to get married and have kids now? I'm guessing you're mother? \n\nAnd bro why does it matter how long you last at a rave? You went to a fucking rave and lasted all you could and enjoyed yourself, thats what matters, not seeing it till the end. \n\nIf all the people you ultra plan everything then maybe try a different group of people. Sure people plan when to meet because not everyone is available all the time, but if a friend ever called me and told me he/she wants to come over tonight or do XYZ, I'd be down, no complications. \n\nI think you're overthinking this too much man, put the effort in and you'll get the effort back\nBroodingBatman: When you were a teenager, human relationships were more front and center. As you reach adulthood, you've already done those things and your'e less willing to have a social life. Because you already had it. Some of us didn't get to have that. You want to do all those things you missed out on. Go to reckless parties during  spring break. Experiment on your body. Coachella. All that jazz. But the other party doesn't want to because they already did it. At the end, you're left feeling alone. Why do you think I crave younger friends so much? They want to do these things. \n\nAdults are just different. The naivety is gone. The wonder and excitement is gone. I guess it can be fun but there's no innocence there. I can't help but see their age. \n\nLet's face it. Adults focus on their careers and the suburban route. And for the nagging part, my cousin is my age and talks of getting married constantly. My co-workers do it to. It pisses me off. I mean it when I say I detest people my age. I want to have fun. Younger people on paper seem more fitting in terms of maturity, more willing to have fun, less likely to talk about marriage and children, and are more practical to my timeline. \n\nI know if I entered into a relationship with a woman my age, I know she's gonna want the wedding in 4 short years. Like I said, because I am so behind I don't think I should do anything like that at least till my early 40s. I'm better off associating with younger people but the chances of those relationships are low and unfortunately, they won't see me the way I want them to.\n\nSo, I'm stuck with my current age bracket who I personally think would only disappoint me. So. I'm better going alone for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm trying to give you the best response. This is what I came up with.\n\nEDIT: The more I think about it. The more I think my life at least socially has been over for a while. I'll just say there isn't really anything close in post college life that resembles the dorms and Greek Life that cultivated so many friendships. No stupid hobby or apartment with flat mates will bring those college years back. I guess the only way I truly can be happy if time was reversed and my adolescence was given back to me. The more I think about it, the more important that I kill myself eventually becomes. It's never gonna get better. Adult life is inherently disappointing. Adults are truly a pain.\nBroodingBatman: Btw man. The fun part of partying is to see it through to the morning.

{"full_text": "LeapDayGuy: Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us cancels bankruptcy auction, plans to revive brand\n\nClypsedra: I hope so. I\u2019m having a kid in March and found out just after the stores closed! So much for having Babies R Us to shop from. I doubt they\u2019ll reopen in my area though - it\u2019s a weird Bermuda Triangle of dead businesses. The building is seated next to a mall with only one anchor store left and about 7 others within. \nExoticCommunication: Good luck!\n\nTake it from a person who has one and another on the way: you didn't miss TOO much with Babies R Us being gone.\n\nWhile the selection in one store was nice, the stores were also incredibly expensive compared to other big box options. The only reason we bought anything at one was gift cards. Otherwise, you can get everything baby-related at a Target or on Amazon. \n\nOh, and cribs? If you can, buy that on CL. I know it might sound icky, but the mattresses themselves are cheap, and the cribs (assuming they're the painted and lacquered kind) are extremely save to bring home and just spray down with a cleaner. We got a crib AND dresser set for less than the cost of one dresser. \n\nOf course new is great too, though! But even then, Babies R Us furniture prices were pretty high-- in between Target and Pottery Barn in some things.\nClypsedra: That\u2019s good to know - makes me feel better on missing out. I\u2019m glad to have Target nearby and I definitely plan on getting my stroller and stuff there. Not even sure if we are gonna do a proper crib yet but thanks for the tip, I\u2019ll keep that in mind! I\u2019ve heard Facebook marketplace is taking off too and is a good place for that sort of stuff. An ikea opened in my state finally too, I\u2019m planning on checking it out for some cabinets and I heard they have good cribs there too! \nExoticCommunication: A few thoughts, unasked, provided anyway because nobody told me this shit when I was waiting on my first...\n\n1. You may not think it, but lighter strollers ARE really nice. We have the Britax B-Agile. It's nice, robust, and the stroller is easy to push around. But it IS heavy. And that starts to get tiring when you're folding it up a bunch at restaurants or to lift it into a trunk. On the other hand, our little one would sleep like a log in the baby car seat (which detaches and attaches to the base perfectly every time). (Target has the B-Agile, just FYI.)\nOne thing I'd recommend is going to the store and pushing around a bunch of the strollers on display with a 10 lbs weight in the seat. Get a sense of how your arms like the feel of it. You will be pushing this thing around every day for years. You need to like how it feels. \nAlso: wait on one of the Target \"Spend $100 get $15 off\" sales or whatever. And then use your red card on top of that. You get an instant 5-10%+ off.\n\n2. You will want/need a proper crib at some point. Once the kid gains some degree of mobility (usually around 4-6 months) you need to ensure they're kept cooped up at night. Babies are great at self-harm. Don't let them. \n2a. Don't co-sleep if you ever want a sex life again. Nobody whom I know who does it has a sex life. \n\n3. IKEA has some solid options, but IIRC their mattress sizes are a bit non-standard. We have one of their toddler beds, and it's pretty nice. Also, if you find one with missing hardware: TAKE IT ANYWAY. I learned this the hard way with my daughter's bed. A coworker gave it to me, I lost the dowels and bolts and stuff and IKEA just mailed me replacement parts. Don't let a missing flange or whatever hold you back on used IKEA stuff!\n\n4. Before you buy a breast pump, ask your health insurance if they cover them! Lots do, and that's $200-300 saved! \nClypsedra: Wow thanks for the advice, I appreciate it. I\u2019ve pushed around a few strollers at target but I was more focused on how heavy the matching car seat was, not the stroller. Good tip. I like the chicco strollers but I think they are on the heavier side. I was wondering how to knock some damage off the $380 price tag, so I appreciate the sales knowledge.\n\nYeah....maybe you\u2019re right on the crib. I know I can\u2019t keep him in a bassinet for long. Also terrified of killing him in any form of cosleeping due to my ridiculous blanket habits, so that\u2019s already a no go. I have past baby experience thanks to my mom who had kids majorly spread out. Took a lot of care of my brother who is 14 years younger than me. My parents kept him in a pack n play because he\u2019d climb out of his crib and crash to the floor, then wander around the house crying. I was hoping to get away with a pack n play too...but that only lasts for so long, then what? I have a 1 year old too big for his bed. Maybe I\u2019ll put off buying a crib and see how it goes, but keep and open mind.\n\nIs a fancy electric breast pump worth the trouble? I plan on being home with the kid breastfeeding and supplementing formula, so I have not thought I need a breast pump mostly because I haven\u2019t had enough time to accept the idea of pumping. I was planning on getting a cheap manual one just in case. \nExoticCommunication: Ah, if you stay home you may not need to, but if the insurance company provides you a pump for free, why not? Plus, if you need to take a trip without the kiddo (it happens!) or you get a plugged duct while baby is sleeping (it happens!) you may want the pump to help out. \n\nWe did a bassinet for the first, err... 3 months, 4 months? Eventually though they'll get too big for even a bigger bassinet. I think ours outgrew hers at around 6 months. The pack and plays are okay, but oh boy are they low to the floor (being... on the floor and all...) Maybe look at the convertible bed-crib things? 2 things in one go!\n\nAnd yeah, wait for Target baby stuff sales. Worst case is you get a gift card that you then spend on diapers.\n\nOh a few items you didn't know you wanted (but you probably want!)\n\n1. Butt paste wand. Trust me. Get this.

{"full_text": "calm_Bunny21: will this really work?\n\ndavidevitali: It\u2019s legit. The water goes in the bottle, the air in the bottle can\u2019t get out so it get compressed, when he opens the front valve the compressed air within  the bottle pushes the water out. How long it lasts depend on the valve aperture / original water flow ratio\n-domi-: The air pressure in the bottle can't be more than the tap pressure of the water (otherwise the air would escape the bottle, instead of the water entering the bottle). That bottle does nothing. The device works the exact same with and without it.\nrdrunner_74: The bottle does a LOT in this setup. It acts as a local pressure reservoir. Without the bottle, you get one \"short\" squirt, then the hose pressure is normalized. With the bottle you have some reserves. \n\nIt will run out slowly if you draw more than you supply\n-domi-: It really doesn't. It doesn't store any pressure, because the pressure of the water is equivalent to the tap pressure, when you open the tap fully. If it wasn't, then the waterline in the bottle would be moving and not stationary. And the jet at the nozzle is whatever that jet is at tap pressure. So, once you open the tap fully, then opening the control valve at the front of the pvc tube will result in the same jet with and without the water bottle.   \n\n\nIt's just a fake video, much like the ones showing perpetual motion devices, or free energy, etc. If this works, then you should totally scale the process up, and run a turbine on the magical free extra pressure you get, and drive a generator with the turbine, which produces free electricity. You could save humankind. Do it.\nrdrunner_74: It does allow you to store pressure. \n\nIt does not allow you to exceed the water pressure though.\n\nBut it compresses the water in the bottle to act as a \"spring\" - You draw more water then you can put in? The water level drops (With the pressure) until it slows down to \"a tickle\"\n\nYou pause a few seconds... the water level raises and the pressure builds back up.\n\nIt can not sustain any \"boosted\" output if it drops.\n\nIn contrast to a perpetuum mobile, this device operates by simple air presure, and it is not able to generate any extra pressure from nowhere. It is able to maintain a higher pressure longer because it adds a buffer tank that can be slowly drained. If the tank is empty, you wont be able to \"squeeze the hose together\" for more pressure like at the beginning. The pressure needs to build up inside the system (Input into the system is constrained by the flow rate of the water faucet).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsider it a pressure battery/capacitor. You can charge them with low incomming power, and later drain more in a short term from it (If resistances allow it).\n-domi-: What water level drop, it's connected to the tap? The water it stores is no different than having a longer hose - that stores water as well, right? The bottle does nothing. The video is staged pseudoscience cringe spam. I dunno what you're talking about, but i'm talking about the video i've commented to.  \n\n\nIn that video, the bottle does nothing. There is no air pressure, the pressure in the bottle is atmospheric before you compress it with the water from the tap, until both pressures are equal (and they become equal to the tap).\nrdrunner_74: The water level in the bottle. It is the pressure reservoir.\n\nWater comes in slow and steady. The bottle stores it (Accumulator)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic\\_accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_accumulator) Have a look at the section \"Compressed gas (or gas-charged) closed accumulator\" (We have no membrane here, since the geometry of the contraption takes care of that)\n-domi-: Water isn't coming in slowly, dude, it's attached to a tap. Unless the point of the invention is to go open the tap, shut the tap, then open the control valve, none of what you're talking about is working. What the video shows is \"free energy\" whereby some \"genius\" builds an amazing contraption which gives you a stronger water jet by putting a do-nothing bottle upstream of your nozzle. It's a sham.   \n\n\nYou're thinking about something completely different. Go watch the video, and appreciate how nothing of what you're talking about applies in this context.\nrdrunner_74: Where is free energy? \n\nIt is an accumulator. You consider a capacitator magic?\n\nYou dont get any water pressure right away. Much easier to block the hose with the bottle attached (Since now there is room to expand)\n-domi-: Did you watch the video? Are you sure you watched the video. Because when you open the tap, and then crack open the control valve behind the nozzle, the jet of water you will get is identical with and without the bottle attached. Go ahead and try it. Build this contraption at home, and you'll soon realize that the magic in the video is probably them opening the tap very little without the bottle attached, and a lot more with it attached.\nrdrunner_74: You wont get the same result, the accumulator will help you to stay at the ~~full~~    higher pressure longer. \n\nThe same reason is why you use a capacitor in an electric PSU. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompressed gas (or gas-charged) closed accumulator\r  \n\r  \nA bladder-type hydraulic accumulator. Fluid fills the internal rubber bladder which expands, compressing the air inside the sealed shell.\r  \n\r  \nFor low pressure water system use the water usually fills a rubber bladder within the tank (pictured), preventing contact with the tank which would otherwise need to be corrosion resistant. Units designed for high-pressure applications such as hydraulic systems are usually pre-charged to a very high pressure (approaching the system operating pressure) and are designed to prevent the bladder or membrane being damaged by this internal pressure when the system pressure is low. For bladder types this generally requires the bladder to be filled with the gas so that when system pressure is zero the bladder is fully expanded rather than being crushed by the gas charge. To prevent the bladder being forced out of the device when the system pressure is low there is typically either an anti-extrusion plate attached to the bladder that presses against and seals the entrance, or a spring-loaded plate on the entrance that closes when the bladder presses against it.\r  \n\r  \nIt is possible to increase the gas volume of the accumulator by coupling a gas bottle to the gas side of the accumulator. For the same swing in system pressure this will result in a larger portion of the accumulator volume being used. If the pressure does not vary over a very wide range this can be a cost effective way to reduce the size of the accumulator needed. If the accumulator is not of the piston type care must be taken that the bladder or membrane will not be damaged in any expected over-pressure situation, many bladder-type accumulators cannot tolerate the bladder being crushed under pressure.\r  \n\r  \nA compressed gas accumulator was invented by Jean Mercier\\[4\\] for use in variable-pitch propellers.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic\\_accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_accumulator)\n-domi-: Answer me straight:  \n1. Did you watch the video?  \n2. Do you understand how taps work?  \n3. Do you know what the pressure and capacity of a water tap is?  \n4. Are you literally just trolling at this point?\nrdrunner_74: 1. yes\n2. yes\n3. yes, Flow rate is approx 6-8l/min from that tap based on the video (takes from 1:15-1:25). I expect a maximum pressure of around 2 atm from their system based on the max water height of the bottle (Which is quite normal). Edit: Nozzle size is about 2.5-3mm\n4. No. This system is a small local accumulator. The fixed width of the nozzle also makes it much easier than the initial demo with the thumb.\n-domi-: Re: 3 - And the bottle does nothing to help with that pressure, all it can hope to do is even out some tiny fluctuations in tap pressure, but i honestly don't remember the last time i've experienced uneven tap pressure.  \n\n\nRe: 4 - Of course, but nothing changes if you remove the bottle.   \n\n\nSo, with those in mind, what does the bottle add by being a pressure accumulator? Help you maintain pressure for 2 more seconds if the water company cuts you off from the main? This is silly. The video is made to show you how the bottle magically creates pressure, which it doesn't. And you're stickling over a point which is perfectly irrelevant. Functionally, this whole contraption would work the same without the bottle, as far as the jet of water is concerned.\nrdrunner_74: The bottle does not \"create pressure\" - It stores the incoming energy to be released later. It can never exceed the maximum pressure of the water system. (Thats why it stops filling at \\~1:25 - the pressure normalized in the system). \n\nAlso with an empty bottle in the system you wont be able to do the \"Thumb trick\" from the beginning. It will provide an alternate location to go vs \"only out through a reduced nozzle\" \n\nIt depends on how much of a drain you put on the system so it can maintain it.\n\nI did some math to get the numbers for another reply. \n\nIf the company cuts you of, you are dead in 2 seconds yes. But you can exceed the amount you get from the system for \\~ 25% for 15 seconds (drain 10l/Min vs 8l/min - or 50% for 7.5 seconds) - Not much but it works for the last 20 seconds of a ticktok video ;) \n\nYou always gain the input from the local water system (8l/min).\nGhostley92: I just gotta commend the effort. \n\nrdrunner actually has an understanding, domi. Quit *your* trolling. \n\nIf the nozzle supplies more flow than the tap can, there will be a pressure drop to atmosphere that the compressed air will supplement for a short time. \n\nThis is about maintaining flow rate at *nearly* tap pressure. Not boosting pressure or making \u201cfree energy\u201d. This increases impingement.\nrdrunner_74: Thanks.\n\nSometimes crunching useless nunbers is fun.\n", "prompt": "calm_Bunny21: will this really work?\n\ndavidevitali: It\u2019s legit.

He\u2019s practicing for a career in the corporate field.\nlowrads: I get not wanting to bring work into one's personal space, but damn.\n\nThis last semester my poor professor had to deal with only two of her students actually activating their cameras all semester.  Just the haggard, middle age hobby-student (me), and her teaching assistant.  \n\nShe was trying so hard, and getting so little feedback.  Zoomers are so selfish.\nAqualungfish: That's a broad generalization that you shouldn't really make.  There could be any number of reasons why a student wouldn't want to show their home.  What if they have a shitty home life, and either their house is a wreck or their deadbeat parents won't stop smoking weed in the background?  Or even they just want their privacy?  You can't (or at least shouldn't) be allowed to require them to turn on cameras.\n\nBelieve me, I understand it's hard, I teach college and I had exactly one student that left their camera on during class, and even in one on one meetings most people left it off.  It basically feels like monologuing for an hour and a half 3 times a week, but I wouldn't for a second think they're selfish for doing it.\nlowrads: It's not that hard to carve out a little tidy space.  I had a couple of places strategically situated so others could have some privacy.  \n\nThe only time I wouldn't turn on the camera was if I was still driving around when class started, and didn't want her to be distracted by my behaving in a reckless manner.\n\nIt's completely normal for college students to show up to class in their pyjamas.  Hell, I even had a post-doc that would teach that way.  If they want to get anything out of education, they should participate, ask questions, give feedback, et cetera.  If they don't, they're just going to wind up with a piece of paper of indeterminate value at the end of their courses.\nBarobor: You are looking at it from the perspective of a middle aged student, who has their own place. Some young adults come from a really shitty home life without the ability to \"carve out a little tidy space\".\n\nNot turning on their camera doesn't mean they can't participate, ask questions or give feedback. They can turn on their microphone when they want to or use the chat function. An important part of a good learning environment is for the students to be comfortable so they can focus on their studies. You don't want them to be distracted by what others might see on their camera.\n\nI find it worrying that this is a bigger issue for you than you driving while attending a lecture. You yourself say you are reckless by doing so, don't you think that's more important than students turning on their camera?\nquailtailor: 12th graders have to keep their cameras on; why can't college students?\nAqualungfish: The 12th graders shouldn't have to, and I'm not going to ask anyone to do it, no matter the age.\nquailtailor: Would you let students sit in your classroom with headphones in and not paying attention? I think that's a pretty rough equivalent.\nAqualungfish: No I wouldn't, but that's not really a good comparison.  For one, a student wearing headphones might be disrupting to other students (I've definitely been able to hear music from other people's headphones before), while not having a camera on wouldn't.  But even if they were the same, again I'll say the students deserve to not have to allow people to see inside their homes.  We can find other ways to ensure they're paying attention\nquailtailor: I don't think you got my original intent. I meant the students who sneakily wear headphones, not those with attitude problems who clearly have no problem being obvious about it (that's a slightly different issue). Please don't undermine my point by bringing up a subsect that *might* be disruptive. I could equally say that students with their cameras off *might* be disruptive by texting/instaing/snapchatting their classmates while off camera. My point is that no teacher would allow that kind of distraction in their classroom (wearing headphones), and I think a student being off camera is equally a potential distraction.\n\nAs much as kids might have home life issues, they are generally smart enough to know how to hide most of the signs through technology. Just as they would in person. I just don't understand how you think privacy overrides ensuring that they are being educated. In K-12, the government is required to give an education. Beyond that, the student is paying for an education. Throughout people generally expect interpersonal interaction. And maybe it's not a bad thing to expose child abuse?\nAqualungfish: First, I don't believe I'm undermining anything (certainly not on purpose) by making a comparison.  A student sneakily wearing headphones is less potentially disruptive than one being open about it, so I'd definitely call that an activity that might be disruptive.  I've seen lots of teachers in my time that would allow a student wearing headphones on a case by case or even day by day basis, much like I've seen teachers who would allow a kid to nap.  It's all extenuating circumstances, I don't believe it's ever a certainty what someone will do, they're always bending their own rules to fit the situation.\n\nSecond, yeah, I think you're right about agreeing to disagree :).  The police don't have a right to see into your home without permission from you or a judge, I don't think a school should have a right just by default.  Privacy is a massive issue in a lot of ways, and I feel that giving up this aspect of it is a step too far.  As for college students, I'm sorry but I worry even less about monitoring them closely, because like you said they're paying to be there.  If the choose not to pay attention and fail because of it, that's on them. \n\nI understand the want to expose abuse, but again, it's the choice of the abusee.  You're taking what little power they have away from them by forcing them to expose it, and that's not our right either.\nquailtailor: I think you made all good points. To one of your considerations, I'm not quite convinced, however, that this will lead to a snowballing effect of losing further rights that you seem to be suggesting. I don't think it's nearly akin to the police personally investigating your home. And, like it or not, but students do demonstrably have limited constitutional rights when it comes to school activities. The supreme court even has an [interesting case coming up](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-cheerleader-first-amendment/2021/04/25/9d2ac1e2-9eb7-11eb-b7a8-014b14aeb9e4_story.html) on first amendment rights for high school students *outside of school*. The school operates in loco parentis because the law recognizes that students are minors and under the control of their parents/guardians/wards. But I can definitely see it being a possible ethical issue about when a teacher should report observing a crime. And I will say that our schools should have higher standards than the bare constitutional minimum.\n\nI also think webcams provide such a small view of the inside of a home and a motivated student could probably find *some place* to have an unobstructed background (where no one will walk by) with or without using a digital background to hide it even further. And I'm not saying it should be on 100% of the time, but more often than not. You said that you know of teachers who let students take a nap or wear headphones. Fair, I'll concede you my earlier statement that a teacher would never allow it. But I think it's important to note that those teachers still know what's going on with their students because they can observe them all the time and know when to cut them some slack. I think the power to observe is more important for teaching children (yes, 18 and under). And that's a key time to work on their ability to interact with their peers and supervisors.\n\nBut other than those things, I think you made very good points about the practical and moral considerations (in this and your other post). I really appreciate you taking the time to lay out your thoughts. I'll grant you that you've had me seriously reexamining my position on this. \ud83d\ude00\nAqualungfish: I'll say that I've reconsidered some of my views as well, but I still think I'm going to fall mostly into the same area I started :). \n\nI'll admit that the snowball effect is a worst case scenario that is not likely to occur, but I figure why open the door at all to it?  I think where my stance ends up is that this is an extreme circumstance that is (God willing) temporary, and we have no idea how any seemingly small decision could be taken years down the line and done who knows what with.  I just can't get behind a decision like this that takes away the little control students have for a relatively minor benefit (especially after your point that minors in schools have relatively few rights).  And I'll be honest, I gave some serious thought to the consequences of just saying screw it, canceling school across the board for a year, and having everyone on equal footing when everything went back to normal (not a chance of that happening, but there were definitely some plusses). \n\nAll things considered, this was probably the most relaxing and productive conversation I've ever had on the internet, so thanks for that :)\nquailtailor: I think we can both agree that this will hopefully not be a long-term experiment.

Pipe will make the hole too small. \n\nI could make the hole bigger but.... \nBecause the hole is right up against the wall, ripping the white trunking that's stuck with tape to the wall off, which would result in damaged wall paint, which I would have to do to get access to the hole from the outside and not the cupboard which is too small, I wouldn't be able to use a drill because...  The hole is right up against the wall. \n\nSo what do I do? Thanks.\nEnigmius1: You'd almost think nobody in the world had ever had to enlarge a hole in drywall before...\n\nYou're overthinking this.  It really is as simple as making a hole in drywall.

You can't get a drill next to a dry wall. Look at the center point of the hole. \nNow.

Unless a new hole was made next to it.\nEnigmius1: Oh, I forgot.

So the angle of drilling would only increase the deeper I went, till I end up drilling into the adjacent wall instead of a straight hole through the wall he's already made a hole in. So I'd have a hole going into the adjacent wall at a fairly severe angle. Who knows if there's electrical wiring in that part of the adjacent Wall or not. Risky. \n\nFiles are flat. Hole is round. Hole is deep. File not long enough. Filing into a hole with flat file won't work right?\nEnigmius1: If you can't sort out how to work a drill and a file, I'm afraid this project might be beyond you.

There could be no such thing as philosophy or science in a strict determinist world. The mere evidence of a single most minute contradictory **belief** collapses the entirety of the claim of determinism.\n\nNobody has defeated determinism better than me, many times, and nobody ever will. Different people have different beliefs. Determinism is pure nonsense merely given that simple empirical analysis, for the claim of determinism would have to maintain that both the belief in determinism and the belief in indeterminism were both deterministically caused. And there would be no recourse to any justification, any science, any knowledge, any progress, whatsoever. You couldn't even \"troll\" if determinism were true for that would be a defiance of the ability to not be able to choose. The existence of any and all doubt in the realm of thought is pure exhibition of indeterminism.\n\nChoice is indeterminism. People can choose different paths. Rocks can't. Parachutes and bowing balls. lol\n\n&gt;Rigoni was motivated by a more philosophical question: \"Is it better to believe or not believe we are free?

If anything, it seems ridiculous to claim that beliefs can be uncaused.\nmonximus: Because both right and wrong answers, correct and incorrect beliefs, would both be **equally** caused by the laws of determinism. You would have absolutely no basis upon which to differentiate. Beliefs are as much a part of empirical reality as any physics motion and movement. Both humans and rocks are subset elements of the universe. There is a difference between determinist empirical regularity and indeterminist empirical irregularity. You merely have to observe that rocks don't change their behavior while humans do. If humans were subject to the same determinist strict causal laws as rocks they never would have nor could have changed their beliefs.\n\nHow could there be any such thing as philosophy when any and all beliefs were necessarily equally valid if they were all necessarily equally determined (which they would necessarily have to be if determiism were true)? There could be no such thing as \"better\" between reasoned considered analysis and pure random gibberish in that case as both would necessarily have to be governed by the same strict causal laws. Hence, no such thing as philosophy.

Therefore, in a deterministic world we would still be able to distinguish true and false propositions.\n\n&gt;If humans were subject to the same determinist strict causal laws as rocks they never would have nor could have changed their beliefs.\n\nWhat causes a change in belief, then?

This is so obvious that I can't believe I have to say it a second time.\n\n&gt;What causes different human creative endeavors of fantasy? Magic?\n\nPeople's creative endeavors tend to draw heavily from their past experiences, and consist in neural activity. If you're a dualist, this is not a very satisfying explanation. But determinists deny your claim that strict causal laws are incompatible with the phenomenon of human creativity. Why should they accept it? You've offered no argument.\n\n&gt;You could say free-will is as synonymously established as gravity.\n\nNot sure what you mean by synonymously established. If you mean that theories of gravitation are no better supported by evidence as theories of free will, you're just wrong. How do you empirically test for free will? It's just not a scientific matter.\nmonximus: &gt;Whether a belief is caused or uncaused is totally unrelated to whether it is true or false.\n\nThat's not correct because the thought ideas of true and false have the same causes as beliefs, in a determinist world. It's sort of a liar's paradox that false beliefs exist; it is true that false beliefs exist as much as true beliefs exist. That all beliefs are not all true, that all beliefs are not all false, is indeterminant. Human will labels beliefs true or false.\n\n&gt;If you mean that theories of gravitation are no better supported by evidence as theories of free will, you're just wrong. How do you empirically test for free will?\n\nOh really? What is gravity? Prove that it exists. How would you methodologically go abot establishing that a force of gravity exists? Merely contrasting the empirical regularity of the effect of gravity with the empirical irregularity of the effects of human action shows that a force of indeterminant free-will exists exactly as much as it shows that a determinant force of gravity exists.\n\nThe entire concept of \"wrong\" is a claim against determinism. It implies the concept of \"right\" also exists. It implies the concept \"better\" exists. \"Better\" cannot exist unless you can choose between alternative possibilities. Can the laws of physics ever be in error? Of course not. Error can only exist where indeterminism exists. **How could error exist in a determinist world?**\n12121212: &gt; Oh really? What is gravity? Prove that it exists. \n\nThat's not how things work. I believe in gravity because the theories that supervene over gravitational forces meet certain criteria for plausible theories, such as making good predictions.\n\n&gt;How could error exist in a determinist world?\n\nI still can't believe you're making this point. People make mistakes all the time. This does not imply that, in doing so, they must have broken free from causal laws. You're confusing mere existence with truthfulness. \nmonximus: &gt;People make mistakes all the time.\n\nPeople \"make\" mistakes, or the determinist laws of the universe cause people to make mistakes?

{"full_text": "jackgary118: In Defence of Strong Emergentist Panpsychism\n\nucanttaketheskyfrome: This article provides two reasons to reject physicalism - the theory that we can explain consciousness with only physical entities. First, the \"transparent conceivability\" argument: because we can conceive of a consciousness-less world where physicalism is true, physicalism does not entail consciousness. Second, the knowledge argument: a person with all the data about an experience still \"learns\" something when they actually experience it. These two arguments are supposed to be compelling reasons to reject physicalism. Are they?\n\nThe first argument equates conceivable with possible, but the fact that zombies are conceivable does not mean that they are possible. Even at my most charitable, I do not understand why \"we can imagine a conscious-less world of physicalism\" is any sort of adequate refutation. The fact that we lack the knowledge to find a contradiction between physicalism and the zombie thesis does not mean there isn't one; we should be more reluctant to discard physicalism. To a physicalist, a zombie is nonsensical. It would be like postulating if the concept of \"health\" evaporates if we compare two identical people, and one of them are missing an organ. \"Consciousness\" could simply be an emergent property of the physical interaction of neurons. This does not demand any mental state.\n\nThe second argument is problematic because I don't think Mary \"learns\" something phenomenal. It sounds like she is just seeing new ways to represent facts she already knows. The \"knowledge\" was acquired prior; her experience with red outside the black-and-white-room is not new. We could test this by showing her something non-red, and asking her to identify the content based on what she has learned about red from inside the room. Alternatively, if she couldn't learn the knowledge from in the room, a better way to resolve this problem is to ask whether this is a kind of knowledge that can't be learned from within the room but still physical. Why do we assume this kind of knowledge isn't simply physical knowledge? This rests on how you define \"physicality\". This is just a word game; I can make it so that physicalism can totally account for consciousness by broadening or narrowing the definition to include Mary's knowledge.\n\nedit: word choice, see infra\ndnew: &gt; The fact that zombies are conceivable \n\nI've never seen an argument supporting that p-zombies are conceivable, either. I've just heard people assert that p-zombies are conceivable, without any evidence that they're not logically inconsistent. (And some have given good arguments as to why they're not logically consistent.) And, as you say, even if it were logically consistent, that says nothing about reality.  \"There might be a different universe somewhere in which X happens, therefore X happens.\"\n\nI mean, they're named \"zombies\" for a reason, right?  \"Fred is not alive. He is in every way measurable to science as though he were alive, and no doctor would be able to tell he's not alive, but *really* he doesn't have the essence of life that makes him alive. He just acts that way.\"  If anyone *today* argued that such a thing made sense, we'd scoff.\n\n&gt; The second argument is problematic \n\nThe second argument is also problematic because Mary is asserted to learn something new when she sees red, but that begs the question. The question is \"does Mary learn something new?\" To assert \"Well, yes, obviously\" doesn't actually argue the point.  I assert that Mary's knowledge is so inconceivably vast, so unintuitively complete, that one's intuition about whether or not she learns something is impossible to deduce without carrying out the experiment.\nFlexography: &gt; I've never seen an argument supporting that p-zombies are conceivable, either\n\nIt's not a claim which requires an argument.  If I say \"I can conceive of a blue tennis ball\", what argument could I possibly provide for that?  Sure, I could give some examples of ways that it's logically consistent, but if you are determined to reject my assertion, then I can never satisfy you, because there are an infinite number of considerations I would need to respond to.\nIf, on the other hand, you think that zombies are *not* conceivable, it's up to *you* to demonstrate why.  \n\n&gt;  I assert that Mary's knowledge is so inconceivably vast, so unintuitively complete, that one's intuition about whether or not she learns something is impossible to deduce without carrying out the experiment\n\nA Physicalist *cannot* take this line of argument.  If it is impossible to determine if Mary learned something new, then Physicalism is false.  If Physicalism is true, then there are only physical facts; thus, Mary--who has all of the physical facts--cannot learn something new.  If it is \"impossible to deduce\" whether or not Mary learns something new, Physicalism is false. \nlurkingowl: &gt; If, on the other hand, you think that zombies are not conceivable, it's up to you to demonstrate why.\n\nBecause it contradicts physicalism?\n\nIf your entire knock-out punch against physicalism is just a burden of proof argument, it's not really a knock-out punch or even good logic, it's just rhetoric.\n\nIf it's *not* a burden of proof argument, then you need to actually prove your claims.\nFlexography: The conceivability of zombies does not contradict Physicalism.  A Physicalist can accept that zombies are conceivable, and many do.  \n\nIn any case, it would be sort of suspect to deny that epistemological claim *just because* it went against a prior commitment you had.  That would be really dishonest.  Whether or not something is conceivable is just a claim about what a person can conceive of.  It doesn't mean anything other than *I can conceive of this thing*.  If you're going to say \"*Physicalism is true, therefore it's got to be impossible that zombies are conceivable*\", you're being dishonest because you are not accurately reporting whether or not zombies are conceivable.  You'd be saying \"well, on the version of Physicalism I subscribe to, zombies can't be conceivable, therefore they aren't conceivable\", then that would be putting the cart before the horse--you'd be presupposing a conclusion without argument, and dismissing contrary arguments by just asserting that conclusion, which isn't really how philosophy is done.  \nlurkingowl: You completely skipped my point:\n\nIf all you have is a burden of proof argument, *you haven't proven anything.*\n\nI'll stand by my belief (which you and anyone else who puts forward the conceivability argument agrees with) that the conceivability of zombies contradicts physicalism separately if you like.\nFlexography: Oh, well I addressed that in my first comment, which you were replying to (and sort of in my reply as well....).  Claims about conceivability are just claims about what you can conceive.  They have to do with whether ideas are logically consistent, whether certain things are contradictory, and so on.  If I say \"I can conceive of X\" there is literally no argument I could possibly provide that would convince you that X is actually conceivable.  I would have to run through infinitely-many considerations in order to show that X is consistent.  If you think that X is not internally consistent--that is, that I cannot conceive of X--then it is up to you to show why.  All you need to do is show one contradiction that is internal to X.  \n\nIf something is inconceivable, there's a reason why--that is, if something is inconceivable, then there is something about that thing which *makes it inconceivable*.  The burden of proof is on you to show that it is inconceivable precisely because there is no way to prove that *anything* is conceivable.  How could I possibly prove the a blue tennis ball is conceivable?  If you were determined to reject blue tennis balls, I could never satisfy you, because I cannot possibly go through the infinite number of considerations I would have to respond to.  If, however, you think that blue tennis balls are *not* conceivable, you need to give one reason why.  For example \"tennis balls have felt, but it is logically impossible for felt to be blue, therefore you cannot conceive of a blue tennis ball\" or something like that.  If you can't provide a reason *why* the thing is inconceivable.... well then it's conceivable. \n\nAnd, again, the conceivability of zombies does not contradict Physicalism.  Physicalism is a claim about the world.  It is the claim that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff.  That is the Physicalist thesis.  The conceivability of zombies is not a claim about the world; it is a claim about what we can conceive of.  These things do not contradict each other in any way. \nlurkingowl: You're still not addressing the fact that all you're presenting (the way you're arguing this) is a burden of proof argument against physicalism.  If you're going to bring up conceivability, and try to use it as a point in an argument, you can't turn around in the middle and claim I'm failing a point you've presented no evidence for.  It's perfectly fine to say \"I believe there's a contradiction in there, but we don't understand the terms and processes well enough for me to spell it out.\"\n\n(Physicalism contradicts conceivability in a separate reply.)\nFlexography: We're not even talking about Physicalism at the moment.  We're talking about about what it takes for something to be conceivable.  For any conceivability argument, the burden of proof is *always* on the person who says that it is inconceivable.  If something is inconceivable, then it can be demonstrated that it is inconceivable.  However, it can NEVER be demonstrated that ANYTHING is conceivable. \n\nI've literally said multiple times there there is ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF any person could EVER provide that any X is conceivable such that you could convince someone that X is conceivable.  That's a basic logical fact about consistency.  \n\nInconsistency, on the other hand, does not require an infinite number of proofs.  It requires one--one example of a contradiction.  This is, again, a basic logical fact about inconsistency.  \n\nThe burden of proof is absolutely completely entirely 100% on the person who says that zombies are inconceivable.  \nlurkingowl: No, the burden of proof *in any argument* is 100% on the person making a positive claim.  If I'm not trying to use conceivability as part of an argument to draw a conclusion, I have absolutely no burden of proof.  I can happily continue on being a physicalist until someone figures out a way to make show that zombies are conceivable (or puts forward some other argument.)  The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\nFlexography: Here's an argument:\n\nP1) I can conceive of blue tennis balls\n\nP2) If I can conceive of blue tennis balls, then  blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nC1) Therefore blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\n\nI can offer absolutely no support for (P1) that would convince a skeptic that I can actually conceive of a blue tennis ball.  If you think that there is a burden of proof on me to somehow prove \"I can conceive of a blue tennis ball\" without having any sort of criticism of that claim to respond to, then this argument cannot go through, and we cannot conclude that blue tennis balls are logically consistent.  We can't even conclude that (P1)--that I can conceive of them--is true, since we can't give an argument for it.  But surely that's not right.  This argument is obviously valid, and we want to say that it's sound too.  We know that blue tennis balls are conceivable.  And if someone comes up to you tomorrow and says \"You totally can't conceive of blue tennis balls\", they better have a damn good reason for their assertion.  The burden of proof is on *them*.  *They* have to give a reason why we can't conceive of blue tennis balls.  We certainly think we are conceiving of them.  So if we are mistaken, they need to show why.  \n\n&gt; The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\n\nThis is simply untrue.  Physicalism is by definition a specific claim.  It is the claim that that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff. This is not controversial.  This is the definition of Physicalism. \nlurkingowl: &gt;&gt;The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\n\n&gt;This is simply untrue. Physicalism is by definition a specific claim. It is the claim that that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff. This is not controversial. This is the definition of Physicalism.\n\nYes, Physicalism is a specific claim.  I was saying that the physicalist doesn't need to present a detailed proof that zombies aren't conceivable.  The physicalist *isn't using it as the premise of an argument.*  They can happily say that inconceivability is a conclusion from their premises (plus the conceivability-&gt;metaphysical possibility claim.)  No part of their chain of reasoning depends on it.\n\nChalmers *is* using conceivability as the premise of an argument.  If the premise is false, the whole argument is invalid.\nFlexography: Here's an argument:\n\nP1) I can conceive of blue tennis balls\n\nP2) If I can conceive of blue tennis balls, then blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nC1) Therefore blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nI can offer absolutely no support for (P1) that would convince a skeptic that I can actually conceive of a blue tennis ball.

They have to give a reason why we can't conceive of blue tennis balls. We certainly think we are conceiving of them. So if we are mistaken, they need to show why.  \n\nImagine if this person then said \"I don't need to give a reason why blue tennis balls are inconceivable.  The burden of proof is on you to prove that you can conceive of a blue tennis ball.  And until you do that, I don't have to put forth any argument\".  If that happened, you would not take this person seriously.  You know that it is not your job to prove that blue tennis balls are conceivable if you haven't been given any reason to think otherwise.  This person will *never* accept that blue tennis balls are conceivable, because it is literally impossible for you to prove that they are conceivable, since that would require that you respond to an infinite number of potential criticisms.

Just like you say \u201cthe chameleon\u2019s strength is it\u2019s camouflage.\u201d Here\u2019s a definition for you since you wanna suggest that my use of strength is an opinion lol. \n\nStrength (Noun) : a good or beneficial quality or attribute of a person or thing.\n\nSo yes, survival of the fittest does in fact mean survival of the strongest, being strongest has nothing to do with physical ability to lift something.\npeelen: &gt;survival of the fittest does in fact mean survival of the strongest, being strongest has nothing to do with physical ability to lift something.\n\nAnd explain me how does it means something different than what I wrote?\n\nI mean your and mine sentence mean \"not only physical strength\" yet mine is opinion, and yours is fact.\nPalm_Tree_Island: Again read the definition for strength.\n\nStrength (Noun) : a good or beneficial quality or attribute of a person or thing.\n\nBy this definition, survival of the fittest is the same as survival of the strongest. They are the same thing.\npeelen: Again how does \"fastest\" doesn't mean  a good or beneficial quality of being fast?\nPalm_Tree_Island: Your initial post is that survival of the fittest is not always survival of the strongest. We both agree that being the fastest also makes that individual the strongest. By this logic you have just stated that the fastest is the strongest, thus survival of the fittest is survival of the strongest.\npeelen: And we both understood that in this statement \u201cstrongest\u201d means physical strength, and we both \u201cunderstood\u201d overall message of it. \n\nI might agree that it was worded poorly, but that doesn\u2019t make it \u201copinion\u201d.\nPalm_Tree_Island: No, strongest does not mean physical strength. This is what I am saying. Strongest has nothing to do with physical strength. Cooperative learning can be a strength. This is where you are wrong\npeelen: So if word it like that:  \n\n\n\"YSK that surviving of the fittest does not mean surviving of the physically strongest\"  \n\n\nThat would stopped being \"opinion\"?\nPalm_Tree_Island: No\npeelen: Ok\n", "prompt": "peelen: YSK that surviving of the fittest does not mean surviving of the strongest\nFittest means those who fit best.

{"full_text": "username-checks-in--: YSK that just because a dog is wagging its tail doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s happy and approachable. Also, growling doesn\u2019t necessarily equal aggression and raised hackles are an involuntary response much like goosebumps...also not a defacto sign of aggression!\n **Why YSK**\\- correctly interpreting a dog's body language can help you interact appropriately with dogs- knowing when you can approach/interact safely, when more information/context is needed, and know when to stay back or stay away to avoid escalating a dog's stress level.\n\nMany people incorrectly believe that a wagging tail is a sign of contentment, happiness or happy excitement in a dog but dogs wag their tails for a variety reasons. Speed of wag, tail position, and wag motion can give you clues as to whether a wag is friendly or not, and you should ALWAYS look at the dog\u2019s whole body language for signs of how they\u2019re feeling, not just the wag.\n\nA dog growling is a dog letting you know that it is scared, nervous, or uncomfortable about a given situation. Again, context and whole-body language is critical. If a growling dog is backing away with its tail tucked, it\u2019s scared, not aggressive!\n\nFinally, raised hackles merely indicate a heightened level of arousal, stimulation, interest or excitement in a dog. All dogs have this involuntary response, but it\u2019s much more apparent in some dogs because of fur length.\n\nThese are some common misconceptions about dog body language but this really just scratches the surface. Take the time to learn about how dogs communicate, even if you don\u2019t have a dog...you\u2019ll have friends or family who are dog owners and this will help you interact with any dog you may meet!\nsouthsamurai: Tbh, the single most important rule  about interacting with a dog is to not do it with one you don't already know.\n\nIf they have a human, that's where you communicate first. Not only is it safer for you with that dog, you'll not make the human mad; humans are far more dangerous than dogs.\n\nIf the dog isn't with a human, you should leave it alone until and unless it approaches you. If and when it does, *then* attempt to determine what mood it's in. If you can't, slowly walk away. If you just aren't sure, and aren't willing to accept the possible risks, slowly walk away. \n\nLearning to speak dog isn't *hard*, but it does require access to multiple dogs across breeds. As OP said, all of the obvious signs can vary in presentation by breed. Since individual behaviors can also be misread sometimes, the larger the pool of \"training\" dogs you have access to, the less likely you are to be confused by breed/size/health/peculiarity. \n\nAs OP pointed out, dogspeak is whole body. It isn't just one aspect of their presentation, it's the whole dog that communicates. The difference between an excited greeting and a  nervous greeting just isn't obvious at first glance because they're *almost* the same visually. It doesn't help that the dog's breed can change their movements enough from others to make detecting that difference harder.\n\nBut this is one of those rare YSK posts that really does deliver! Great info that could well help both dogs and people.\nSALAMI-BOI: how do i tell if a dog is happy?\nsouthsamurai: Happy? There's food going down their throat :)\n\nTail: sort of moving circular if they're greeting their human. Otherwise side to side *usually*, and with the right side being a slightly stronger movement. It would be held roughly in line with their spine, or slightly lower *if* the breed has a typical slightly curved tail. Something with a \"curled\" tail would be higher and harder to detect the relaxed state. Some breeds just naturally default to a lower tail position than average (sight hounds often, and \"runners\" like greyhounds and some herding breeds)\n\nThe overall posture would be relaxed. Neither tense and leaned forward, nor withdrawing or cowering. If the dog knows you, a belly display usually indicates an openness to contact, if the dog isn't familiar with you, it *might* indicate being nervous about you. \n\nThe face should be relaxed, probably with an open mouth. The tongue is likely to be loose and may \"loll\" as the dog moves. You might get the impression of a smile.\n\nThe eyes will likely be relaxed, almost drowsy looking if they were human. If you see the whites of their eyes, they aren't happy at all.\n\nThe ears, if not on a breed with  upright ears, will be relaxed totally. With upright breeds, they stay neutral. Neither pricked, nor reclined, and not to the sides or drawn back.\n\nSee what I meant? A lot of that is going to look different on different breeds. A sharpei always has droopy eyes. Chows have tails that aren't as easy to read. Whippets and greyhounds have a low neutral tail position, so they often look nervous or unusually submissive even when they're not. Bulldogs are hard to read in general, and if their tail is docked, it's even harder. \n\nOne of the few signs that I've never seen vary is the play bow. Impossible to misunderstand afai have ever experienced.  Even stumpy little dogs like pugs do that\nSALAMI-BOI: Thanks, i love dogs but i've only ever petted one as far as i can remember, this cute all-white fluffy regular sized dog came up to me on the train once.\nsouthsamurai: I know what you mean :)\n", "prompt": "username-checks-in--: YSK that just because a dog is wagging its tail doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s happy and approachable.

Criticism and discussion are much welcome.\n\njustsackpat: Would vegans welcome a world in which there are no livestock animals? \n\nAnimals such as cows, sheep &amp; chickens have been looked after &amp; selectively bred over thousands of years to provide humans with a product (food, fabric, fertiliser etc).

The only way to totally end cruelty to cows is for there to be no cows at all. \n\nThe answer isn\u2019t to ban eating animals (though I do assert that some people/ countries eat too much poor quality &amp; cheap meat) popular culture needs to change. We all need to try to buy local &amp; welfare quality assured produce. \n\nThe death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\nTinac4: &gt; The death of an animal is not a big deal. Poor treatment of them while they are alive is.\n\nHow universally do you apply this principle?\n\nConsider a hypothetical human society where a number of kids are raised under the best possible conditions.  All of them are happy and satisfied, until they are killed painlessly and without warning at the age of 15.  Is this ethical?  If not, what makes this scenario different?\n[deleted]: Depends on your definition of 'ethics'. I argue that it wouldn't be unethical to kill 'isolately'. To kill any living being is 'fine' as long as their death does not inflict suffering on other living beings. For example, to kill a calf would be 'wrong' because their mother would suffer by cause of their death.\n\nHowever, if said calf existed in isolation and their death did not cause emotional or physical harm on others \u2013 and the procedure was to be done painlessly \u2013 I can see no problem with their murder. It does not matter if it is an individual of our species or another's.\nTinac4: I personally disagree--I'm more of a preference utilitarian than a classical utilitarian--but I see where you're coming from.  It does seem to me that your position leads to some unintuitive results, though.  For instance, if you came across a sleeping homeless man, you had a method to kill him painlessly and take his money, and you knew with certainty that nobody would care about or notice his death, would it be ethical to kill him?  (Obviously, this involves a lot of simplifications that don't apply in real life.)\n[deleted]: &gt; would it be ethical to kill him?\n\nI suppose we're having a mature discussion here so I'm going to answer honestly. Simply put, yes. But then again, that's according to MY definition of 'ethics' as I stated in the earlier comment.\n\nAs long as the procedure is done in a peaceful and painless manner, I really can't see how that would be a bad thing. It may help if I clarify that I'm an atheist who doesn't believe in afterlife, so to me death isn't anything gruesome.\nTinac4: Fair enough!

Nothing any specialists can do they tried.\nYttriel: Just wondering, did you perhaps take a multivitamin or a cold medicine that had zinc in it during the cold?\nyelhsa87: Nah I didn\u2019t take anything and the inflammation was very bad, I should have went to the dr it\u2019s what caused it. By the time I went it was just damaged and they said it may come back slowly over years. I can Taste a tiny bit more than I could 6 months ago but not much. Previously I couldn\u2019t taste or smell anything at all.\nYttriel: Gotcha. Well just know that you're not alone and once you regain your smell to avoid zinc!\nPetrichordates: Zinc is good for both getting over colds and maintaining healthy testosterone levels, some people are probably modestly deficient so a blanket prescription of \"avoid zinc\" isn't great advice.\nYttriel: A good general rule of thumb is to avoid most things if they can otherwise be gotten through your diet. If you're worried about testosterone levels, eat more foods with zinc but I still say avoid vitamins/medicines with added zinc.\n\nI'm sorry but, \"reducing a cold by one day if taken within the first 24 hours of a cold,\" does not outweigh the potential permanent loss of smell.\nPetrichordates: I'm not aware of evidence that this risk is as significant as you imply.\nYttriel: You know how an old study found that vaccines cause autism? More recent studies have since debunked this, but the world at large still draws a connection between vaccines and autism.\n\nAn old study found that Vitamin C helped tremendously with colds. More recent studies have found that this isn't really the case, at best some people can lessen their cold by maybe a day. But the world at large thinks Vitamin C will cure their cold.\n\nA 1984 study found Zinc to be wonderful for colds. Now more recent studies have found this to be inconsistent, at best you can lessen a cold by a day if you take zinc promptly. But many newer studies find inconsistencies with Zinc's usefulness. But people still view it as a godsend. \n\nZinc-containing nasal sprays, namely Zicam were taken off the market in 2009 because they were causing permanent loss of smell in some people. People reported that one day their nose suddenly burned from it after never having burned before. Some people lost their sense of smell/taste permanently, some gained some of their smell back after months...\n\nTaking supplemental Zinc is just not worth the risk. Just eat a few oysters or something.\nPetrichordates: Oh nasal sprays, you didn't mention that part. That obviously changes everything.\n\nThe point that zinc is the only proven vitamin/mineral that helps you get better faster is pretty damn significant.\nYttriel: Probiotics (again I advocate for sourcing from diet rather than supplements) have and always will be the ultimate helper to one's resistance to colds.\n\nTake zinc if you want, just know there are side effects. If you really want to boost your immune system look into probiotic foods - which have never made anyone lose their sense of smell.\nPetrichordates: Do you have scientific evidence to back up that statement? Probiotics reduce the length of illness? Which?\n\nWhat are the side effects to zinc? You started off with some anosmia thing but neglected to mention you were only referencing nasal sprays. I feel like you keep continuing with that conflation too, as high zinc foods or supplements aren't destroying anyone's noses.\nYttriel: Evidence to which of my statements?\n\nI understand that the actual scientific research does not mention anosmia as an effect of zinc in a tablet, so if that is the only thing you're willing to go off of then there's no point in continuing.\n\nMy reason to believe that zinc even in tablet form not just in a nasal spray can cause anosmia is based on personal experience. I wasn't sick, I had no sinus issues going on at the time when I took two (the recommended amount for my age) multivitamins which advertised \"plus zinc,\" and I then lost 90% (that number is just me, it's not an exact or doctor-appointed number) of my sense of smell.\n\nSo, yeah, perhaps the scientific research doesn't back it, but I absolutely believe that if a proper study was done that they would find results which support my claims. I've also known someone else to lose most of their sense of smell and it happened after they started taking multivitamins with zinc. IIRC the rich of the ancient Greeks took Mercury for health reasons, and now we know how toxic Mercury is.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those anti-big-pharma or anti-modern-medicine people, I love advancements in medicine, I'm just of the belief that we don't understand the dangers of zinc yet, because me and someone else I know have had an adverse side effect. Could it have been something else? Yes. Can I live my life without supplemental zinc and avoid the potential risk without decreasing my quality of life? Absolutely and I recommend others to do the same. Especially those who already have lost some sense of smell. I'm afraid that if I started taking supplemental Zinc again I could lose 100%.\nPetrichordates: You're spreading misinformation my man. I asked for simple evidence of your assertions and you won't provide them, while attacking scientific evidence for zinc as inadequate  while conflating nasal sprays with zinc in general. You're even using a personal anecdote to make a scientific claim (seriously??), which is exactly the same as what the anti-vaccine folk do.\n\nI will continue to reply as long as you spread misinformation, in case anyone is misled by that nonsense.\n\nDo you think they just didn't study it and you discovered something all by yourself that studies will eventually back up?

{"full_text": "wowbobwow: YSK about the little-known band Jellyfish, which only released two albums and never received widespread fame but went on to become hugely influential\nFirst, a disclaimer: I have no connection to Jellyfish or any of the folks associated with them - I'm just a fan who discovered their music a couple years ago and was astonished that they aren't more widely known.\n\nWikipedia has [the whole story,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish_\\(band\\)) but here's the TL;DR: Jellyfish formed in San Francisco in 1989, released two albums of gorgeous and intricately-produced music (generally lumped into the \"power pop\" genre), and broke apart in 1994. There were a few people who cycled through the band during its brief lifetime, but the two principal creative forces driving the group and their sound were [Roger Joseph Manning Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Joseph_Manning_Jr.) and [Andy Sturmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Sturmer). \n\nDespite being driving by a pair of legitimate creative / musical geniuses, Jellyfish had some absolutely terrible luck, which almost certainly contributed to their lack of commercial success. Two serious problems in particular stand out to me:\n\n* Their 'visual style' heavily borrowed from San Francisco's 1960's hippie culture (on-stage look, album art and music videos), and was just hopelessly dated and silly by the early 1990's. Almost all their videos and live concerts display this style, and it's really at odds with their sound\n* Their sound (both recorded and live) was *gorgeous*, using complex vocal harmonies and intricate multi-layered instrumentation (note the repeated and enchanting use of harpsichord in several of the tracks I link below)... all of which was completely at odds with the rapid swing into the Grunge Era they were musically competing against in the early '90s\n\nJellyfish only released two full albums (not counting some demo tapes and a few live bootlegs): Bellybutton and Spilt Milk. Both albums are absolutely crammed with tracks that evoke (without entirely ripping off) many familiar artists and bands, ranging from The Beatles, Badfinger, Cheap Trick, Queen, The Beach Boys, etc.  - basically any major group that incorporated complex harmonies and arrangements within the rock/pop genres. Put another way: if you like any songs from any of the groups I just listed off, you're almost sure to find at least a couple songs from Jellyfish that you'll adore.\n\nFor anyone who isn't already familiar with Jellyfish and their two albums, here are a few selected tracks from each of their albums, with a few personal notes or observations:\n\nBellybutton (1990):\n\n* [The Man I Used To Be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEA0dwWB7yg) - Apparently determined to begin their musical career by being weird (but also beautiful), Jellyfish opens their first album with a dark but catchy exploration of the toll that war (or any parental separation) can take on a family\n* [That Is Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQTj_2mMfSA) - Here's a perfect example of one of the problems I noted above: here's an absolutely *perfect* '90s power pop song, saddled with a silly and dated looking music video. I'm tempted to only link to the song itself without the video, but maybe seeing the video will help clarify why Jellyfish didn't explode in the MTV era the way their music should've demanded\n* [She Still Loves Him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M5zRbuEbE8) - Another beautifully-written song exploring a dark topic (physically abusive doomed relationships), with a sound that evokes something Paul McCartney &amp; Wings might've put out\n* [Baby's Coming Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I48AFJKCt20) - Just exquisite power-pop, but with clever lyrics often not found in the genre\n\nBellybutton showed a young band flexing their creative muscles while also being pretty up-front about their musical influences. While many of the songs on Bellybutton were exceptionally good, the album as a whole didn't feel quite complete. After Bellybutton gained moderate critical acclaim but failed to result in major sales success or significant national recognition, Jellyfish retreated to the recording studio and focused all their creative and technical abilities on their second and final album, Spilt Milk. Instead of shying away from evoking their musical influences, Jellyfish basically doubled-down and set out to create a power-pop magnum opus, complete with wide-ranging lyrical themes, rich sonic tapestries, complex and nuanced instrumentation, and heartbreakingly beautiful vocal harmonies. Here are a few particularly amazing tracks, but really, if you've made it this far in this crazy long post, you should just listen to the whole damn album from start to end.\n\nSpilt Milk (1993):\n\n* [Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSD00bMSrhs) - Jellyfish, always determined to buck expectations, opens their second and final album with a sweet harmonized lullaby, effectively setting the stage for the rest of the album both musically (those layered harmonies!) and thematically (it's all a dream, but hold on tight anyway)\n* [Joining A Fan Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JojV8kNfWK8) - Rocketing out of the peaceful reassurance of Hush, Joining A Fan Club is a powerful comparison between the youthful longings of a teenaged fan dreaming of her pop idol, and her parental figure feeling similarly enraptured by an exploitative televangelist\n* [Glutton Of Sympathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-8Flo4Udmk) - Being lonely sucks, but it sucks less when you can write and sing about it this beautifully \n* [The Ghost At #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjL1WhqH9Xc) - This song explores the tragedy of rock gods who only get their much-deserved respect after dying young... recorded by a band for their final album after failing to get their much-deserved recognition while they were still going.

{"full_text": "Rob_Rogers: Poor Man's Bankruptcy\nWhat do you do if you get in way over your head in debt. Bankruptcy is one path but it is has a cost since you need to hire an attorney and go through the court process. That court process is intimidating and public. One viable approach is to simply walk away. Being broke is not criminal and both parties (bank and you) agree from the onset to accept the risks. I don't think people realize that when it comes to unsecured debts, you can just stop paying. Unsecured means a credit card or personal loan. Debts connected to auto or real property are secured debts. You can walk away from those, but you'll stand to lose the asset. You can walk away from unsecured debts, and keep everything. In order for a credit card company to try to recover monies, they need to secure a judgement against you. In order to secure a judgement, they need satisfy the requirements in the Fair Credit Reporting Act before I judge will hear it.\n\nI'm not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. I am sharing my personal experience.\n\nI found myself a new college grad with over 50k in credit card debts across multiple cards. At the time, my focus was on doing whatever I needed to do to finish school. This includes all credit spending, charges and cash advances. I used them to subsidize my cost of living over 6 years. I had a modest first job as a new graduate. I I rented but had roommates. The 100k student loans activated and were now due. Something had to give so I decided to walk away from the cards.\n\nThe immediate response was constant robo calls reminding me that I was past due sometimes until 10pm. I received mail daily that I was past due. I changed my mailing address to a PO Box and forwarded mail there. I started blocking numbers and turning my ringer off at night. After about 3-4 months I started to get 3rd party collections notices. I answered every single one of them in writing. I denied owing what they said I owed and replied with signature confirmation that they needed to provide me with a copy of the signed loan contract, calculation of all spending, my signed receipts of all spending, calculation of all interest payments, and their license to work as a collection agency in my state. Some would disappear after that. Others would send me incomplete information, so I could reiterate that I disputed the claim and needed complete information.\n\nNot a single collection agency provided all the information. I mean, how could they. It was a near impossible ask. Some would reply and say they were dropping the collection and returning it to the original creditor. I felt like I was starting to win.\n\nAll this occurred over a period of months. During that time, I got a new job and moved to a different state. In that state I established a new phone number and new PO Box. Every now and again I would get a collection call on my new number or new address, but it was minimal. I would again block the call or reply demanding they validate the claim. If I was feeling lazy, I wouldn't open the envelope, mark it RTS across the front (Return to Sender) and drop it back in the mailbox.\n\nAfter about a year, I would get charge off notifications. This means the credit card company is writing off the debt and is taking it as a loss. They would send me a tax document for it. The IRS had a process in which discharged debt income could be excluded from taxable income, but you had to fill out the right forms. Because of the huge student loans, I had a negative net wealth, so I qualified. I filled those out and never paid taxes on the discharged amounts.\n\nIn the second year, there was one collection agency that was particularly stubborn. They sent me some certified mail. A notification card sat in my PO Box and I never went to the counter to pick it up. They did that maybe 2-3 times and each it was not picked up and after a few days the post office automatically returned it to the sender. Pro tip: Never sign for unsolicited certified mail.\n\nAround year 3, I started pulling my free credit reports and would do so every year thereafter. I disputed any/all negative marks with the credit reporting agencies. For example, if Transunion removed something, I would send that report to the other two agencies and usually that would be enough for them to remove it on their reports as well. But it's a slow process with 2-3 months in between each response.\n\nAs time went by, I never went to court, nothing was garnished, nobody seized anything, no process servers came to my door, nobody called me at work, no police came to my door.  I always paid the student loan and rent, never missed a payment on either of those. Always filed and paid my taxes. After six years, I was satisfied that the statute of limitations for collecting on unsecured debts had sunset (varies by state). I went to my brick and mortar that I had been banking with the whole time (debit card only) and got a credit card with a $500 limit and started to build up a positive history. Two years later I bought a house with a traditional mortgage.\n\nNote: That the credit reports were questioned by new employers from time to time. I said the debts were related to medical bills and medical condition. That stops them from questioning further as medical is protected and I never lost a job offer due to bad credit.\nnesowat: Disgusting lack of ethics. Why should the creditors have to pay the cost of your ignorance and irresponsibility?\nRob_Rogers: They gave an unemployed 19 year old an open $50,000 line of credit.

I know it has it's problems, but the social order is quite fine, people are pretty much equal (compared to the US), and there aren't people living in poverty in such great numbers.\n\nBut except for Germany, most of Europe has immense public debts that are forcing governments to impose austerity measures.\n\nFor Germany, the USA, and China, a semi-socialist model of wealth redistribution from a small class of owners of automated production to a broad class of part-time workers and full-time benefits recipients can work.  I like that model.  I just don't see it working in a place like the UK or Spain that doesn't actually make anything.\nGNeps: 1. You are very much overgeneralizing. My country, Czech Republic, for example has very low public debt. And even the numbers for the whole Union are pretty much comparable to the US (Europe has bigger debt then the US by about 15% when compared to GDP, which is not much - something like US 100%, EU 115%)\n\n2. You're talking about the middle class, and yes, it can work, and not just the USA, Germany or China, it has worked all over Europe, in Japan, Canada, South Korea, you name it. Strong middle class is basically the best state for a society to have, both socially and economically.\n\n3. Saying things like \"Span and the UK don't actually make things\" is either the greatest understatement on your part, or total lack of understanding of economics and foreign trade. If they did not make things, they would be as poor as Africa. They do make a comparatively as much as the US per capita (about 75% of US per capita production).\neaturbrainz: &gt;You are very much overgeneralizing. My country, Czech Republic, for example has very low public debt. And even the numbers for the whole Union are pretty much comparable to the US (Europe has bigger debt then the US by about 15% when compared to GDP, which is not much - something like US 100%, EU 115%)\n\nOK, I overgeneralized, but that doesn't escape the fundamental problem: how do you finance a welfare state without public debt while still running a semi-capitalist economy that will occasionally need Keynesian stimulus?\n\nMy answer is: scrap the deficit-spending Keynesianism and shift to a basic income grant over other forms of welfare.\n\nThis is why I didn't talk about the middle class.  The middle class was a temporary creature of regulated industrial social democracy.  Post-industrial economies tear their middle classes to shreds, leaving only a larger lower-working class and a smaller professional class in their wake.\nGNeps: Hell no. Europe wants its middle class. It's obvious that strong middle class equals happy nation. Look at the US vs. EU. Most Europeans would not want to live in the US, it's too dangerous, too uncomfortable. The US economy sure is more efficient (hence the greater GDP per capita), but it comes with a price of social instability. We do want our welfare state. I personally think Europe is the best place to live in this day and age.\n\nConsidering the deficits, that's simply not a solution to discontinue welfare state. For the reasons above, and too for the reason that it would simply not work. The US has very lousy welfare state, and yet it has almost as much deficit as the EU. This is a political problem  - politicians like to spend, but hate to cut. That needs to be solved differently.\n\nLook at OWS, those people are deeply unhappy with the falling middle class. They basically want European style equality. I hope they get it, it's a wonderful state of being. The reason is, middle class is the power maker. They are many, and they are reasonably rich. They are listened to. The top 1% has great powers, but it has to compete for power with the middle class. However, when there's no middle class, all power is with the 1%. Nobody listens to working class.\neaturbrainz: I'm all in favor of \"European\"-style equality, but I'm just saying that over the long run I don't think the middle-class society can actually be preserved against the forces of outsourcing and automation.  Well... not without fairly protectionist trade policies.\nGNeps: Well, it's been holding pretty steady for more than a hundred years now. And I personally don't think it will have many problems. There is only so much you can automate and outsource.\n\nThe only problem on the horizon I see is the Singularity - when people build an AI smarter than we are.

{"full_text": "Lnfinite_god: Is it normal to not enjoy people's company?\nWhen I'm completely isolated I do enjoy a bit of occasional small talk, but like now, when I'm amongst people pretty often (almost daily), I just find it annoying. I honestly can't work up the energy to be nice and polite or to make small talk. It seems like too much effort. I rather run a marathon (by myself).\n\nI gotta say though, a friendly smile from a cute girl on the street makes me feel good, no matter how social or isolated I am.\nArtamovement: It depends what you mean by \"not enjoy.\" Some people need to hang around others all the time. Some people need a lot of alone time to recharge. Some jobs are well suited to people who need large amounts of solitude, like park rangers. I would recommend that you find the right balance of sociability that works for you but also you should take care that you are not antagonizing to others.\nLnfinite_god: what's antagonizing?\nArtamovement: Thinking of others as anything but your kinsmen, comrades, or dear friends. Sending anything other than warm feelings to yourself or others.  (This is obviously for situations where you lose nothing by doing so, such as at work or walking down the street.)\nLnfinite_god: Well, when I can't put in the effort to be kind and nice, I send indifferent feelings. Mostly because I am bored and not enjoying myself. Doesn't have anything to do with people. That's why I probably don't like their company, I have to worry about my feelings are affecting others, which is like an extra pain in the ass when you're already not enjoying yourself.\nArtamovement: What are the barriers that keep you from enjoying yourself around others? \n\nAlso, I would add that there will come a time when you will need friends and allies, and you will wish you had sent good vibes to more people. Friends are precisely the people who will secure for you opportunities. \nLnfinite_god: That's not a motivation to make friends: \"some day some of em might give you an opportunity\".\n\nPeople are different, I want what I want and others want something else. It gets very tiring to always have to ask everyone to do what you want to do, when what everyone else always seems to wanna do, is something other than you want to do. \n\nI've heard many times that I am different than the majority of people.\nArtamovement: The question then is one of finding people with similar interests. Also, having friends who can offer opportunities is simply a matter of ensuring you have options in life, instead of no options, which is the very definition of poverty.  \n\nI can't quite make out what you mean by what you want, but let's take it in a broader sense: Do you want knowledge? Do you want skills?  Building relationships with people is the way to pursue these goals, and building relationships means having long conversations. \n\nLet's say you want to build a robot. You could probably find people who want to do the same thing. Or, start a heavy metal band, build a hut, create a video game, whatever. Absolutely no one can succeed entirely by themselves, and all you need to do is show some goodwill, ask a question, and not interrupt someone when they talk in order to make a friend.\nLnfinite_god: if it takes that little, I suppose you could say I have friends at the table tennis clubs I play. I just never considered them as 'real' friends, because I don't meet up with them outside of table tennis. Well apart from one guy, to see his TT robot, cuz I wanted to buy it.\n\nMy goal is to become very good at table tennis, in order to do so I have to work on my technique and train often. At my club, most people are there for enjoyment or exercise, but no one is quite as motivated to get much better as me (the ones that are pretty good, barely come there, and when they do, I barley get a chance to play with them). So even those people with the same interest, are much different than me. Because all I want to do is drills and focus on having the proper technique, whilst they want to play matches/free play and use whatever technique that comes natural to them. When they do or say they do try to use proper technique during or after a tt lesson, they simply can't do it or not for long. They always go back to what's familiar and natural to them. Which is annoying, because it makes it very hard to do good drills with, in fact, you can't. Because a good drill requires both players to use proper technique. So the only way I can properly train for table tennis is when I pay 15 euros for an hour of training with a coach, or when I play at home against a piece of wood (which is hard because it bounces the ball back too slow or not at all). With these coaches I can easily talk non stop about table tennis, because they probably used to have the same or similar passion for it. In the beginning I could have fun talking with the more recreational beginners with bad technique (well they mostly did the talking), but most of that probably had to do with me not having talked to people in a long time. Now that I'm used to it, I'm not as interested in what they have to say anymore, I mean never was, but I enjoyed the company, now I enjoy the company much less. If the person doesn't have a similar passion or knowledge, I can only small talk for a couple of minutes before it starts to bore and disgust me. (if small talk lasts ~2 minutes I do enjoy it. But much longer and I don't.)\nArtamovement: It sounds like you've got a lot of drive and determination.  Table tennis is certainly fun and I'd enjoy playing it more often than occasionally. \n\nI would say that anyone with the drive to get really really good at something is going to look like an eccentric to people who have no goals--that is until the goal-oriented person becomes an exemplar.  \n\nI wouldn't look down on people who don't share your passion but rather find out and admire them for the passions they do have. That being said, it is up to you to determine the amount of time hanging around others that is advantageous to your goals.\n\nLastly, everyone rolls their eyes at small talk but there is no way to get people to talk about the interesting things that matter to them without establishing trust based on common interests and opinions through small talk. You also lose nothing by getting good at it, so why not?\nLnfinite_god: well with certain people, you get a feel there won't be many common interests. For example I'm 22 into sport, internet and film, single, no job, one guy is 55 who is a baker, kids and wife. Apart from table tennis, we probably don't have many common interests. His life is his job, wife, kids and table tennis, it's a cool life, but different from me.\n\nI wouldn't look down on people who don't share my passion either. I don't see why anyone would, I don't even see how that thought entered your mind.\n\nI think admiring is a pretty strong word. You can admire all your friends if you want, but don't demand me to do that.\n\nI'm pretty sure not everyone rolls their eyes at small talk, almost everyone I regularly see (mostly 40+ men with kids), seem to **love** small talk.\n", "prompt": "Lnfinite_god: Is it normal to not enjoy people's company?\nWhen I'm completely isolated I do enjoy a bit of occasional small talk, but like now, when I'm amongst people pretty often (almost daily), I just find it annoying.

{"full_text": "bluetack_man: Shed Framing - critique and advice needed\nI am building a shed and I'm going to be starting on the concrete slab soon with the aim to finish the slab before Christmas and build the shed early Jan/Feb. \n\nI have mocked up my design in SketchUp. I don't have a whole lot of space in the garden and the shed is a unique design. The shed will be one side a shed and the other side a greenhouse, with a single shared wall and shared roof. The shed-side will have a normal shingled roof, the greenhouse-side will have a plastic roof to allow in light. \n\nHere is a straight on view: [https://imgur.com/8MuMgTc](https://imgur.com/8MuMgTc) the main shed-side on the left, greenhouse-side on the right\n\nSlightly angled view showing the shared wall and more framing: [https://imgur.com/ovT9rD9](https://imgur.com/ovT9rD9)\n\nBirds-eye view showing rafters:  [https://imgur.com/qeUWOfI](https://imgur.com/qeUWOfI) \n\nThe greenhouse door I have not headered because the door will be very light and made from a few timbers and plastic. Greenhouse will be light-weight plastic, not glass. Foundation will be a 4 inch concrete slab, with 4 or 5 inches of compacted gravel underneath. \n\nCan anyone more experience than myself have a look over and tell me if anything obvious is sticking out that would be a hazard. I don't want it to be bomb proof, but I also don't want it to fall over in the first big wind. I live in the UK, we get very mild frost/hot seasons and we don't get any torrential gales or anything like that. \n\nMy only major worry is that the rafters would press outwards onto the side walls and over time may push them away from the central wall. I'm going to double top-plate the shed and I will also add two thicker beams horizontally tied in with Simpson Ties to brace the side walls and hopefully prevent push out. \n\nDimensions are approx. 11.8 foot x 10.2 foot, with roughly 4 foot being the greenhouse-side. Height at the highest point is roughly 11 foot, roughly 7.8 foot at the eaves.\njaproct: Your base plan seem ok, but I have a couple of modifications I would make. First off, there is no reason to be using posts in this framing at all. They add no strength that you could jot get out of doubling up studs or making channels or corners out of the same wall studs. Birdsmouth cuts in the rafters at the bottom with blocking between them will be pleanty rigid and secure. For simon ties, use standard hurricane clips or better yet, use what is called a \"birds mouth\" rafter tie. Its overkill, but that roof will never blow off. Lastly, when you pour the concrete, snap a wet line on all four sides denoting the wall centers. On this line, sink some foundation bolts into the concrete for secure anchoring. 2 on every wall is pleanty, even overkill for this. Now is also when you want to figure venting also. If you are going to have simple gable vents or soffit and ridge vents you can frame them in to begin with. Good luck.\nbluetack_man: Thank you, that is very helpful! The posts are mostly because I already have them to use and I want to use them for something, are they counter productive? If so then I'll just frame it out using the regular timber, but as long as its not taking away strength then I want to use them. But I am not totally sure on them yet, maybe I will just remove them and replace with regular timbers.\n\nBirdsmouths are the plan for the rafters, and ties as you suggested. I had already planned to insert bolts as you suggested for the concrete, so glad I'm on the right path there! \n\nVentilation I had not planned at all, I'll add some vents at either end of the shed and the greenhouse - thank you for pointing that out!\njaproct: You are more than welcome. I learned when I built my first greenhouse that they get hotter than hell!!!! Bad thing. Wound up having to add them afterwards and it was a real pain. Good luck, ask any questions any time. Also keep a pic diary and post when done. A lot of people want sheds and you can help show that its a good project even for inexperienced people if they plan it well like you have.\nbluetack_man: Yeah I bet it will get roasting in there, good call on the vents. Some of the windows in the greenhouse will be open-able too. I've found a cheapish website that sells decent thickness plastic so I'll make some windows and some simple hinges for this. I love the feeling of planning a big project like this, lots to think about and problem solve.\n\nAnd yes I am very inexperienced! I'm a desk worker by day, biggest thing I've built in wood was a bench about a year ago so very much looking forward to tackling this beast.\njaproct: \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d.

It seems to me, after nearly 10 seconds of research, that the set of \"tea\" includes the subset of \"tisanes\" which is equivalent to \"herbal tea\".\n\nThank you, thank you, and you're welcome.\n\nEDIT: Also, green, black, and oolong are teas, not tisanes, upon further research.\nantani2: Actually \"tea\" is a kind of plant, it's a species.\nGinger, for example, it's a tuber.\nyou are welcome.\n\nJFConz: Unfortunately for your desire for superiority, \"tea\" also refers a hot beverage made from plants in several parts of the world, not only ones made from the tea plant.\n\nTea has more than one definition - either directly referencing a specific group of plants (as you have done, so wonderfully), or referring to a drink made from letting bits of other plants (including tubers) sit in hot water (herbal tea/tisane).\n\nSince you decided to come back and double down on your technical correctness - I have prepared the following:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea is my source. First line of first paragraph: Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to Asia. This supports your statement of tea as a specific plant. \n\nLet's continue. The third paragraph: The term herbal tea usually refers to infusions of fruit or herbs made without the tea plant, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. These are sometimes[8] called tisanes or herbal infusions to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant.\n\nWhat you said originally is equivalent to \"a subset of colloquial term, tea, is not tea, it's a subset of tea\". You can't tell, but I held my pinky and nose up very high when I paraphrased that in order to capture the real essence of your dialogue. To which I replied with a widely accepted definition of tisane as an herbal tea, which refers a hot beverage made in the exact same way as specific, technical tea, just not from tea the species/group. You've come back with again, a narrow definition (stating the obvious in this context) intending to exclude for the sake of your own esteem and return my own biting condescension (good luck).\n\nTo wrap this up and save me any further joy: tisanes are colloquially refered to as herbal teas, but are still considered part of the tea beverage family, not to be confused with the tea plant which can also be made into a tea beverage.\n\nDo you feel better yet? Language is a wonderful thing often interpreted and used in ways that do not fit the rigid mold of original definition and grammar. When you allow yourself to be more flexible and less concerned with strict, absolute correctness, you will find many different shaped pegs may fit in that round hole.\n\nNot every word has a 1 to 1 correspondence with an idea and some ideas are contained within other ideas the same way a crow is contained in a murder. Several words evolve away from their first definitions (see: Fob). Being the kind of person who bothers to show up to an informal conversation to point out irrelevant (and incorrect in your case) formal, classical, traditional definitions is a great way to isolate yourself.\nantani2: this is a tea plant: http://www.gmag.it/wp-content/uploads/Camellia-sinensis-563x353.jpg.\n\nthe rest it's not.\nJFConz: Bless your heart.

You seem to be literally incapable of understanding that tisdanes are called teas or herbal teas by the majority of tea drinkers.\n\nYou brought nothing.\nantani2: you drink coke and say \"coke tea\" you fuckin idiot\n\nJFConz: I actually laughed out loud. \n\nI never mentioned coca-cola (coke is slang for cocaine, but I'm sure you knew that). I have also made the distinction that herbal teas (tisdanes) are made from plants, not anything you can imagine. Your wonderful imagination opted to use a soft drink.\n\nI like how you've resort to low-effort insults because you're finally realizing every contribution you've made to this conversation is foolish.\nantani2: I like you have to write 10 lines comments because you can't express a concept.\nJFConz: It's just that my short replies weren't getting through. I thought I would spoon-feed you a simple idea by breaking it down, including sources and quoted text, and briefly going off topic for the sake of insulting you.\n\nTisdanes are also called herbal teas and are hot plant-based drinks not made from the tea plant. \n\nNice to see that in addition to being incapable of understanding rudimentary English, counting also evades you.\nantani2: blablabla get a life loser\nJFConz: You came back 13 hours later to have the last word with another low-effort insult.\n\nIf I am a loser, certainly you are too - you are the other side of this shit conversation.\n\nMore likely, you're just a moron desperately trying to feel like you're not in the bottom 10% of the human population with respect to basic English, math, schoolyard insulting, and herbal tea knowledge.

What are you figuring out 'just now'?\n\npoiklpu: I just saw the secretariat and while not the greatest movie by any means, it made me think about something. (spoilers ahead) the lead character, a housewife, takes control over her father's horses because he has Alzheimer's and his wife just died. The father then dies and she's given control of the horses, and her brother control of the estate. The estate will need 6 million to continue to run and by now Secretariat could be worth 7 million. She is eventually is offered 8 mill but ultimately declines, and this is important. She declines because she believes the horse can win the triple crown (a feat not accomplished in decades) and the horse will be worth it by the end of it. Because this is a disney movie of course the horse ends up winning the three races, and winning the final race (longest of the three) by a margin of about 30 horses. I'm pretty sure his time and distance hasn't been beaten to this day which is kind of amazing actually. But onto the point of all this. \n\nIn the race right before the first triple crown race, Secretariat had a sore in his mouth and ended up taking third, and if this happened in any of the triple crown races it would have lessened the horses value after the fact. And that made me think. If Secretariat happened to lose some or all of the triple crown races, the owner would have seemed crazy. Following the races, the brother and her husband would have said that they were right when they told her they shouldn't sold the horse. Also I'm sure in any future arguments with the husband and her, financial or otherwise, would have, more often than not, ended in the husbands favor. Probably with the underlying notion that \"the wife makes bad decisions, gets caught up in fanciful, sensationalized ideas, and is a bit crazy, and the husband thinks rationally and makes the decision that's 'right.\" I'd also go as far as to say that most everyone would have looked down on her because she put her family in debt with the risk she took. History would have forgotten her as a woman who literally bet the farm and lost, but instead she goes down as the woman who fostered the greatest racehorse ever.\n\nSo history would have looked at her as crazy for the rest of her life or a genius based on how one decision panned out. One decision. This racehorse could have been training one day and a blade of grass could have been floating in the wind, or a bug could have been flying along the track and either of them could have gotten into his eye, caused the beginning of an infection and made the racehorse unfit to race until after the last race. She would then be considered crazy for sending her family into debt and trying to win a race no one had won in 20 some odd years. It made me realize that depending on how much risk someone takes, we can deem someone incredibly wise or ridiculously foolish by the **outcome** of a decision. Not by the decision itself, but by how it pans out. It seems a bit insane to me that we as a society can look at two different women who make the same exact decisions, who take the same risk, but call one an incredible dreamer, and one a sensationalist young woman, all depending on the position of a blade of grass? **tldr:**Maybe i'm overthinking a simple children's movie but if it's the people who make the big risks who drive innovation in our society, the people who put their life savings in to an idea they don't know will work, or mortgage their house to see if their hypothesis will hold true in an experiment that is costly, how can we as a society fault them if their idea doesn't pan out? \nChickenOfDoom: Because our society is obsessed with the idea that the individual has absolute control over his/her destiny. We can all make it big as long as we're just good enough to do it, and those who don't become one of the elite were just too lazy/stupid/unskilled.\n\nBasically, our class system is propped up by an illusionary meritocracy based on our collective denial of chance as a major factor in our lives.\n", "prompt": "Botunda: I wished that I realized that I mattered more in life.

Two stories plus an unfinished basement.  In our previous (much smaller) house (just a couple miles away), we placed a window-mounted evaporative (swamp) cooler (a \"MasterCool\", IIRC) in the window well of an egress window of an unused basement bedroom.  It worked amazingly well for us, and we'd like to replicate the effect in this house.\n\nHowever, we've got a bunch of complications.\n\n* We'd like to avoid installing a cooler on the roof.  We'd prefer ground-level access for maintenance, etc.\n\n* We'd like to avoid unnecessary noise in the living areas.  So, going directly through the wall into the living room isn't something we'd want to do.\n\n* The windows in the basement are not large enough for egress (and I'm not quite ready to bite off that project--which is likely going to require a future post).  We'd want a larger unit than in our previous house, anyway, so window wells aren't going to work, this time.\n\n* No existing duct-work.\n\nSo, I'd like to run a larger evaporative cooler on the ground (or thereabouts), and run the air into the basement.  It looks like I could probably blow the air into the basement through the (wood) wall between the floor joists, immediately above the foundation's cement walls...but I'm wondering if there's a better way (read: \"is that unreasonable?\").\n\nAssuming I can get the air into ducts situated between the joists, I'd like to ultimately direct the air into the main level.  I'd love to have a register (or several, depending on CFM requirements) in the wall(s) of the entryway, but I'm not sure what to expect when it comes to running ductwork from an open space (the basement) into a (non-load-bearing) wall cavity.\n\nSo: Am I out of my mind?  Should I lower my end-result expectations?\narizona-lad: So, if you have not have forced air for heating, are you using electric or hydronic rads throughout the house?\n\nA whole house evaporative cooler for a large home will have ducts around 20\" X 20\", or even 24\" x 24\".   Do you have some closets perhaps, that you can use to travel between floors and act as a place to run the ductwork through?\n\nMy cooler outputs 6500 cubic feet per minute.  Waaay more than an A/C, so the ducts need to accommodate the much higher air flow.\nTreDubZedd: The house currently runs electric baseboard heaters throughout.  I'd ultimately like to replace them with in-ceiling radiant heating (probably also electric, rather than hydronic), but that's a project for another time.\n\nI recognize that a cooler like this is going to have large exhaust (and intake) requirements.  I think if I run three ducts between floor joists, I might be close enough (while allowing for some air to blow into the basement itself)--each would be 16\" x 8\", at least.\n\nUltimately, I'm less concerned about how to get the air circulating through the house than how to get it *into* the house.\n", "prompt": "TreDubZedd: Help Designing Evaporative Cooling System into Basement--Denver, CO\nMy house in Colorado is all-electric, with no forced air for heating or cooling.

Ants are aware of chemical trails in their environment. Even the lowly amoeba is aware of sodium levels in their surroundings. From their perspectives, human \u201cawareness\u201d of their world is complete obliviousness.

Whether it\u2019s the bison, or cabbage, or the microbes we ingest. Life has to take life as a matter of survival.\n\nCruelty and sadism, on the other hand, are in a different realm. Knowing and deriving gratification over causing pain is a mental health issue.\nRightiesLackEmpathy: I think it's dangerous as FUCK to equate the lost life of a bison with the lost life of bacteria. why not apply that to humans? billions of bacteria die every picosefond, so who cares of humans die, right ..?\n[deleted]: Nature has no concern for morality - yours or anyone else's.  And correspondingly, it has no care about humans over bacteria.  We ascribe our own arbitrary value to a human v bison v bacteria.  It's not dangerous as fuck.  It's just fact.\nRightiesLackEmpathy: not really sure how you take that fact and use it to justify not having any morality at all, essentially. to you, even though the ability to suffer is far more complex and thus meaningful for a human vs a cell, you shouldn't have any opinion because the universe evidently doesn't care about anything and is just physics run amok. \n\n\nyou can be that sort of person who doesn't have any principles of his own, using the callousness of the universe as justification for why you don't join other humans in their fight against the elements, but it just makes you no better than the rest of the rabble who put their head down and ignore the problems of the world\n[deleted]: Who says the \"ability to suffer\" is complex?    \n\n\nIgnore the problems of the world ---- you're the one claiming all living things are less valuable than a single human life, not me.\nRightiesLackEmpathy: actually...no. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that the ability to suffer is paramount. if a bison can suffer, it has enough value to deserve a life without suffering just like humans. humans just have more complex brains, so their ability to perceive and comprehend makes their suffering greater in magnitude.\n\n\nI mentioned the human vs cell because that is the biggest know disparity between organisms in terms of nervous and comprehensional development. humans also evolved specifically to feel emotions because it allowed for better societal cohesion if someone felt things and wasn't a sociopathic monster. our very species is evolved, as are many others to variously lesser degrees, to feel and suffer for a specific biological reason. cells do not have these evolved attributes, they all evolved into directions where they essentially amount to chemical robots which seek different chemical concentrations in its environment\n[deleted]: SO you get to decide that the ability to experience some level of sensory input (suffering is one) is what makes a living thing worthy of being alive?  \n\n\nBTW -- suffering is the basis for most religions.  Humans are supposed to suffer htis life (if you believe that shit).\nRightiesLackEmpathy: I don't get to decide anything. no one gets to decide anything. you decide for yourself, and that's all we humans can do. we perceive reality subjectively, we will never see the true truth, whatever that may be. \n\n\nbut I don't think it makes something unworthy of life if they can't suffer, but rather that it makes them unworthy of moral consideration. makes them unworthy of being protected at all, especially not worth being protected against a human trying to like, wash their hands or take antibiotics\n[deleted]: True truth?  Oh please.  If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound if no one is there to hear it?  You can subjectively decide whether or not that sound is loud based on your evaluation but the \"true truth\" has nothing to do with your perception of reality.    \n\n\nI think the right might not be the only ones who lack empathy.\nRightiesLackEmpathy: empathy requires that the other organism has any ability to feel. the only way to feel empathy for a bacteria is to stop thinking, to match how it doesn't think at all.\n[deleted]: No - empathy has nothing to do with the other organism.

But it does have its set backs if the person you're talking to make use of situation analysis and/or is experienced with analyzing a situation on wich the person itself is part of.\n\nAnd by trying to understand determinism(cause and effect) I have done something like this for quite a awhile.\n\nBut if you provide me a phrase, sure, if not, meh I'm out.\nsablejouster: Ok, try this one: We can't live forever can we? \r\nSomething simple, slightly negative and widely known...\n[deleted]: Actually I wish you'd gave me a phrase where I would need to think rather than one someone else would.\nsablejouster: One of my favs: Without order nothing can exist - without chaos nothing can evolve.\n[deleted]: If I come in contact with a materialist he'd argue that 'order' and 'chaos' do not exist, both are just perceptions.\n\nYou could argue that order is the rule of determinism, but if chaos does not exist, how can you tell if its really order?\nsablejouster: Chaos is also a mathematical theory... it could be proved to exist...\r\nThat phrase links to this \"apparent\" biology, as you know, has an order eg. cells, tissues, organ,system. Order or not, this is followed everywhere so it cannot be chaos... but then chaos deals with probability so chances of chaos occurring in repetition could be the same reason this planet is unique... \r\n\r\nBack to point: this phrase could be pulled to idea generation also, then ideas aren't necessarily matter so you could pull this conversation as much as you want... You don't know about order or chaos because as there is no such thing as Always right or wrong... \n[deleted]: There is a utterly high probability of me not knowing the correct definition of chaos.\n\nCould you elaborate to me?\nsablejouster: You probably know Chaos better than me...\r\nI probably referring to the end products of the butterfly effect (eg. humans)... that effect says that one small change can cause drastic changes in the end product, quite simple, but think about what it would take to reach the same end product again... so the universe could be taken as infinite probability (assuming we are atheists), so here order would help 'restore the balance' in order to get repetition of improbable products... thus hopefully showing the importance of order... \r\n\r\nI am also limited by my own knowledge so I'll look like a fool trying to explain my view of the world to someone else!\n[deleted]: Ahhh Chaos Theory, I am aware of it, but even tho its called chaos theory its not because its 'chaotic' in the sense that it _is_ random, it's called chaos because placed in reality, we can't know for sure how its gonna end, even if there is a definite non random way it work, we can't know because we don't know how to mesure or even if we can mesure, but the order exist in the same way.\n\nWe're talking about the same thing, just in different levels of abstraction.\n\nWhich would be a problem if I end up talking to someone that thinks similar to me heh\nsablejouster: Haha I agree with ya... the idea of placing it in reality is a very intriguing one. I have a hard time defining what reality is.\r\n\r\nSo you are not a materialist so (could I know the opposite of it? not idealism, that is too extreme... can't Google it anywhere...)\n[deleted]: Actually, I don't know yet or even if I can define me, I used to think that I was an atheist, but that held only one information, then I went with determinist, which took base on my atheism, but then it wasn't enough since determinism is just a way to show how our reality works, it doesn't say anything else, just HOW it works by cause and effect.\n\nSo if determinism is just the way reality works, I though that it wasn't suitable to call myself a determinist, at least not for my own unknown purpose.\n\nFrom that, coupled with my previous attempts of looking for meaning by understanding/imagining/confabulating the universe, I reached nihilism. Now I though I was onto something, until I realized that I was wrong on a level that I couldn't see before:\n\n1st, I can't objectively say that a higher purpose doesn't exist, I can only state that I'm unaware of it.\n\n2nd, \"Nothing matters\" is fundamentally wrong as in if reality works through cause and effect, the right thing to take from that would be that everything matter, nihilism was a wrong understanding from reality. Nihilism only talks about ultimate lack of purpose, which I don't know if there is something or not, so I can't say there isn't the same way I can't say there is. Its the agnostic approach actually, \"I don't know\".\n\nSo nihilism wasn't something that fitted an accurate definition of me, and so I went 'deeper'\n\nBy understanding cause and effect (determinism) and taking an agnostic approach to things I had no information about, materialism arose.\n\nSo materialism had to be it right? Well, kinda. I won't say that I AM materialist, but I'm ok with saying that materialism is all I can be right now. And unless I acquire information that would go against said philosophy, I'll remain materialist because I can't see any other way so far.\n\nIf I can objectively say something about myself, it would be that I'm trying to understand how it all works, the whys and the whats. Materialism is the higher I could achieve for now, I didn't get there by reading about materialism, I read about materialism after looking for a way to describe what I though was going on.\n\nSo I'm not a materialist, I'm always changing.\nsablejouster: Wow I wish I had a deeper understanding of myself like you (though the journey is never ending) ...\r\n\r\nFrom all you have told me I believe you have an open mind, as Internet states open mindedness is one of the main attributes towards agnosticism... try reading about agnostic materialist.. just for a bit of classification.\r\n\r\nI just want to know this... do you want to find god yet cannot find means? Despising the idea of god as then fatalism could occur? or Don't care about god as he/she/it has no actual effect in your life...\r\n\r\nknowing that really helped me position myself on my views.\n[deleted]: I'm glad you liked my attempt of explanation :P\n\nWell, to be honest I don't know why I search, I'm not looking for a purpose of things, I'm looking to understand things, I do have wishful thinking but I try to stay away from it as it could cloud my perceptions.\n\nI have no purpose for understanding either, I just like to understand, you could keep me happy for eternity if I could never reach reach the ultimate understanding of everything, but at the same time, I could keep understanding more and more.\n\nI like to understand things, its not the purpose that I look, deep down, I like to understand.\n\nBut if you ask me why I like to understand, I'd have to tell you that I have no idea. (yet heh)\nsablejouster: Glad to see that there are open minded people... as most people I know have definite attitudes and usually try to stuff it down people's throats, those people I just don't understand...\r\n\r\nI doubt why you will know, the fact that you will learn, to understand, what which you cannot figure out. Meaning the search for knowledge is \"just in the blood\" as people say it...\r\n\r\nIts good to see that you acknowledge the gaps in your knowledge. First step towards intelligence!

{"full_text": "SuperFlaccid: Suffer no more! YSK how to cure a burnt tongue or mouth. Also: this is my first post on Reddit :)\nHey everyone--\nMy Stepmom taught me this trick, for which I am ever grateful. It's the old sugar-on-the-tongue trick.\n\nThe feeling of a burned tongue or mouth is one of those pains that is just so subtly annoying that it drove me NUTS. Next time you're way too eager for a hot cookie and obliterate your mouth with its delicious, piping hot gooeyness, be sure to cure it with sugar. \n\nThis trick works every time for me-- I'm fairly certain it has something to do with the enzyme amylase, which digests sugars in your mouth. It cures a burn almost immediately, allowing you to go about your day as if you had never taken that regrettable bite/ sip of the regrettably hot snack.\n\nOnce you burn your tongue, or any other part of your mouth, open your mouth so that it can have some access to air. \n\n-Coat the area of your burn with sugar (brown or white). Be extremely generous with the sugar. \n\n-Keep your mouth open/ tongue out, because this ensures that the sugar stays put and doesn't get swallowed. \n\nAfter about a minute, or longer if you wish, you're pretty much good to go. Bada bing bada boom, presto-change-o perfectly fine-feeling mouth!\n\nPlease tell everyone you know-- this tip has saved the day so many times for me. I go out of my way to tell people about this, even if they are strangers and totally weird-ed out by my listening in on their burnt tongue conversations.\nrdmiller3: A burn is physical damage.  Sugar does *not* magically fix it.\nRahms: it's the kind of thing I can imagine working.  So what if he doesn't know the science behind it? Judging from your comment you know about the same amount as him, except he's tried it.\n\nI'm definitely skeptical but there's no way I'm arrogant enough to come here and say THIS IS WRONG.  It could coat the burn or something, just like clingfilm/vaseline works for normal skin burns.  Mouth wounds heal in a strange way because they can't scab over, so I actually have no idea.\n\nI've just made a cup of tea, but I'm not quite dedicated enough to try it on purpose...\nrdmiller3: Pain relief recipies *which don't work* are a staple of folk remedies.  The last one I debunked was the old \"put flour on a burn\" bit.\n\nThe biological reality is simple.  The best thing you can do for a burn is to *cool it down* for a while.  Heaping sugar on your tongue while drying it out with exposure to air does *not* do that.\n\nThe sugar-and-air method isn't very helpful.  It might be better than drinking more hot liquid but swishing around a mouthful of ice-water or cold milk would work much better.\nRahms: well yes, obviously most folk remedies don't work, but if a guy has come here saying he does it regularly and has found it effective, then I'm atleast going to try it before I claim it bogus.  He's not trying to sell us something or get us to read his stepmom's blog etc; he hasn't got any reason to lie about it.\n\nAnd no, the biological reality is not simple.  I don't know enough about medicine to go into a list of factors that affect burns, and neither do you, which is the point.  Yes, cooling it down does help.  Does this mean the only way to stop a burn hurting is cooling it down, and anything that doesn't directly do this will fail? No.\nBuddhaBuds: No, the best thing for a burn is to do nothing to it. cooling it down with any method will draw more heat from inside your body out through the burn, making the burn worse.\nRahms: can you give me some sort of link showing this?  We're talking about superficial burns here, not anything serious.  And we're talking about pain relief.\nBuddhaBuds: i dont need a link it is really easy to understand. Putting something cold, like ice or cold water on a burn will draw heat from your body through the burn. This happens because when the burn and that cold object meet, they want to equal out and become the same temperature.\nRahms: ...I know how conduction works, but how much core heat do you think a finger has in it?  And then how hot do you think a body is?  It will draw more heat to the surface, sure, but 1) it won't end up any hotter than the burn started and 2) it won't be hot enough to cause damage.\n\nSo yeah, you do need a link.\nBuddhaBuds: Im not going to go the extra effort for something a little common sense can figure out. I am sure if you google \"why shouldnt you put ice on a burn\" you will find an answer maybe that will be a little easier for you to understand. I suggest finding some type of cream for any burn that does not need medical attention. Or you can do what i do and suck it up.\nRahms: I just showed how common sense disagrees with what you are saying (for the reasons you gave). Also, \"cooling things down\" is not the same as putting ice on them; at no point did I say ice works.\n\nSo yeah, it's really quite pointless disagreeing with factually based things if you just expect people to take your word for it.\n\nThe fact is that for minor burns (i.e. the type we're talking about), doctors will recommend cooling it down ASAP (running water for example) and then covering it up. \nBuddhaBuds: with almost room temperature water, for a very short period of time (usually until the pain temporarily goes away), then to gauze wrap it. any time you use the words cool or cold, what is the first thing that will run through someone's mind? ice or cold water. also i am not the one disagreeing. i was just trying to pass on a helpful tip to people. im sure if they are really that concerned they could do a search that will yield them the answer. no need to get all defensive.\nRahms: no, they say under a cold tap.  Ice is different to water because it sticks to the wound, not because it's too cold; it's nothing to do with drawing heat from the body.  And the cooling stops blistering, it's not just for pain.\n\nThe \"helpful\" tip you supplied was incorrect and so I asked for some sort of source/backup, then you replied in a condescending manner.... And then you call me defensive for further replying/debunking?\n\n\nBuddhaBuds: The cooling aspect of treatment is only to reduce swelling and take away the pain. Like i said, if you use room temp water, you should be ok. \nRahms: Wut.  You actually said room temp water is what you should use (replying to a post saying use cold), which, again, is incorrect.\n\nYeah, you would be OK.  Just like you'd also be OK if you just put a plaster (band aid) on it, it's still a worse method of treatment.\nBuddhaBuds: You care way too much about nothing. Good day, sir.\nRahms: I care about facts.\n\nCheers\n", "prompt": "SuperFlaccid: Suffer no more! YSK how to cure a burnt tongue or mouth.

{"full_text": "jimmy2465: A girl approached ME today for the first time\nWas out at the bar with a couple buddies just watching the hockey games and getting some drinks when this girl from across the bar came over to our table and introduced herself to us and asked us if we wanted to get a drink with her and her friend. Her friend had a boyfriend and both my buddies I was with have girlfriends so the only single people were the 2 of us. Still not exactly sure if she was into me or one of my buddies because they were pretty drunk and didn\u2019t hang out with us for too long because they had an Uber on the way. Was supposed to hang out with them on the beach today but they\u2019re too hungover so we\u2019re rescheduling.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019m super happy it happened but I don\u2019t think I like when girls approach me first I\u2019ve just realized. I don\u2019t know why. It kind of threw me off guard and I started to get nervous which I never get when I\u2019m talking to girls.\nSealOfApoorval: Oh didn't know we were going to bars and hanging out with people. Looks like the pandemic is over haha.\nbjjkaril1: What a shocker, young and healthy people going out to drink and socialize? Who would have thought that would ever happen?\nSealOfApoorval: In a country where the existence of a pandemic is a political opinion with no accountability I sure didn't see this coming!\njimmy2465: I\u2019m not political even slightly. Could care less I just live my life day by day and mind my own.\nSealOfApoorval: You don't have to be political to be irresponsible. Just living your life like nothing happened is a blatant mockery to the thousands of people dead and the millions still suffering.\njimmy2465: So what? Do I stay home all day everyday and wait until covid stops killing people? Doesn\u2019t seem like the smartest way to go about it. More people are gonna die from starvation and being homeless due to covid than covid itself all while crippling our economy worse than it already is. Numbers are inflated severely considering anyone who has covid at the time they die is counted as a \u201ccovid death\u201d regardless of their previous health conditions (cancer, diabetes, etc). Most people who are dying are above the age of 70 and have an underlying condition like I stated before. Healthy people should be able to live their lives normally and everything should open back up entirely. Stay home if YOU are worried about contracting the virus. If you\u2019re not healthy and are worried about getting the virus with the possibility of dying, they should stay home too. But don\u2019t tell the rest of us how to live our lives lol\nSealOfApoorval: Oh right you're one of those. I don't even see a point arguing anymore, you're just going to blindly believe what you want and cherry pick \"facts\" anyway.\njimmy2465: I\u2019m not blindly following anything, I think for myself, you\u2019re the one blindly following the governments mandates\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02you would think in 2020 people wouldn\u2019t still be such sheep to the government yet here we are\nSealOfApoorval: Once again it's not a political opinion but a fact. I thought you weren't in the slightest political Nd yet here you are talking about governments and sheep people. Please take a moment to reflect on yourself and broaden your sources. Just because people don't die from covid, doesn't mean there aren't symptoms. And symptoms last for months on end and are very debilitating. And yes it affects \"young and healthy people\" too that are all so hyped up to  be completely immune to this.\nBy going out and prolonging the duration of the pandemic you are hurting the very economy you are trying to save.\njimmy2465: Just because I mention the government and sheep doesn\u2019t make me political at all. I don\u2019t dive into politics like most people on reddit and twitter do because I don\u2019t want to be miserable. You told me I was a sheep and I flipped it on you because quite literally you are the sheep here not me. I understand there might be symptoms afterwards but to me that\u2019s not worth thousands upon thousands of innocent people dying because they can\u2019t put a roof over their families heads or food in their kids mouths. Take care of your immune system and start eating better and working out rather than relying on the government to come and save the day. No I\u2019m not directing that at you but everyone in general.  I don\u2019t ask for you to agree with me but at least understand where I\u2019m coming from here.\nSealOfApoorval: I am having a pretty hard time understanding where you are coming from. It Looks like both our end goals are similar but how is you going out to party going to solve homelessness or hunger? And do you not care about the thousands upon thousands dying of covid then? Or the many more that are suffering even to breathe? Like I said earlier it's pointless to argue because you're still going to just do what you want to. And referring back to my original reply, it's because we have no accountability here.\njimmy2465: How is me staying home gonna solve homelessness and hunger? Me going out and \u201cpartying\u201d which isn\u2019t what I was doing I was just sitting at a table getting drinks watching hockey w a couple friends on a summer Thursday night. Nothing more. At the end of the dat we both have the same end goal just different ways of going about it which I personally think is fine, both of our hearts are in the right place whether or not you or anyone who disagrees with me thinks.\nWeeabooWithin: It's you that mentioned homelessness. Staying at home will help with Covid-19. What if you interact with someone that interacted with someone that has Covid-19? What if someone you're with has it but doesn't know yet? Sure you have a mask, though you can't drink with the mask covering your mouth, can you? I'd think that the social distancing is hard and unless they've done some changes to places based on social distancing I doubt everyone will be out of coughing/sneezing distance, or will be likely to avoid contamination they're unaware of.\njimmy2465: It\u2019s just mind blowing people get mad at others for going out to a bar while socially distancing but are perfectly ok with protesting in the streets with thousands of other people shoulder close. Am I wrong? Also to touch on what u said, if someone has covid and show no symptoms, the chances are slim to none you can spread it to someone else. The only way (or at least the most common way) you get covid and truly get sick and messed up is the person you encounter is having symptoms. The death rate is less than 1% as well if you didn\u2019t already know. And no I don\u2019t wear a mask when I\u2019m sitting at my table drinking because you\u2019re right I can\u2019t eat/drink with it on.\nWeeabooWithin: I never mentioned anything to do with protesting. I never expressed anger. You're touching only on part of what I said.\njimmy2465: I\u2019m sorry if that came off like I was insinuating you said that, not how I meant for it to come off. But most of the people in this thread coming at me for being out during a \u201cpandemic\u201d are the same people out at protests the last few months doing the same thing but even worse so the logic just doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nThe bar I went to and the ones around me are very strict about covid. No more than 8 people at a table, mama required everywhere besides sitting down at ur table, 2 hour limit per table, etc. \n\nMe spending money at the bar keeps people who really need money right now with a job and income to support their families.

When I was 12-13 [M] I actually had the same problem. People didn't like hanging out with me because I was loud, obnoxious, most of my jokes fell short, I didn't listen to other people well. I started paying attention to what I did around other people. Became more considerate. Learned to keep my mouth shut. I helped others when they needed it. Told jokes only when they had a good chance of landing. Within 2 years I was one of the most popular guys in school. People liked hanging out with me because I made them feel good and I made them laugh and I didn't monopolize the conversation or act awkward. I read books like \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" and really tried to improve myself to be the kind of person people wanted to be around. For me it was mostly just keeping my mouth shut, I changed my personality from blabbermouth to reticent with a few jokes. I was always getting invites from people. Remember everyone wants to hang out with someone that makes things fun, so just learn how to become that person in your own style. It won't come overnight, but you can make your personality more charismatic, especially at a young age like 15, once you get to mid-20s it will be much, much harder to change so start working now. \nSirLanceOlong: &gt; This is most likely because they don't really enjoy hanging out with you.\n\nIt can be, but it doesn't have to be that.\n\nWhen I was the same age as OP I used to hang with five other guys. Three of us used to party together but the other two didn't seem to enjoy it that much so we never asked them. They were still my best friends, but we didn't party together.\n\nI always invited them when I had a party at my place and then they usually would show up, though usually pretty late. After a couple of parties one of them said he really liked it and partied with us everytime after that!\n\nI'm not saying you're wrong, just that you might be, since we don't know that much about the situation.\nBurningChicken: I completely agree with you. This was just one out of a near infinite list of possibilities based on my personal experience. It could be almost anything, but still it doesn't hurt to improve your personality. One of my best friends used to have an incredibly annoying habit of whining about everything. He was totally cool other than that. I'm not sure if I mentioned it or he just matured, but for the past 5 years he has been much less of a complainer and infinitely more fun to be around.

{"full_text": "jericho2291: The brain and intelligence.\nSo a few weeks ago I watched the movie \"Waking Life\" and one lecture about our \"sense of self\" has been on my mind ever since.  I can't quote the movie directly, but the discussion is mainly about an amoeba's \"sense of self\" as compared to ours.  An amoeba is a single celled organism, so it's \"self\" is just this single cell.  Humans on the other hand are many billions of cells in a single colony, so our \"self\" is vastly different from an amoeba's.\n\nSkip ahead a week and I'm reading a lot about artificial intelligence and the human brain.  I began thinking about the hive mind behavior of ants and other social insects and the concept of [swarm intelligence](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Swarm_intelligence).  Swarm Intelligence is basically a collection of individuals following simple rules with no centralized structure, which leads to the emergence of intelligent global behavior completely unknown to the individuals in the collection.  \n\nBack to the amoeba quote from waking life, I began thinking about our brain behavior.  Are there any theories suggesting that our brain follows a similar \"swarm intelligence\" behavior?  Perhaps each of our neurons/cells behave independently of one another, the product of which is our consciousness, intelligence, and self-awareness?  Perhaps this behavior can easily be simulated using simple laws and a cluster of individuals, giving rise to complex artificial intelligence.\ntreelovinhippie: This is exactly what I think consciousness is... merely an emergent phenomena from \"collective behaviour\". It's a bit like how ants can build a wonderfully complex ant hill with air vents and giant structure, but no individual ant is aware of what they've built, and there is no central control.\n\nAnother example is water. Individually, H2O molecules are not \"wet\". But as a collective, the \"wetness\" property is emergent.\n\nHumans are doing the same thing now as ants IMO. Our global economy and the Internet are emergent and already so sophisticated that no individual or group of individuals could begin to fathom what we've created. And I'm hoping the emergent property of the Internet will be conscious AI.\n[deleted]: &gt;I'm hoping the emergent property of the Internet will be conscious AI.\n\nThat's a very very very long shot\ntreelovinhippie: How?... it already behaves much like a brain. Think of it as an organism.\n[deleted]: Same thing you can say about sub atomic particles, ants, city arrangements. Just because uncoordinated actions can lead to intelligent behavior it doesn't mean it will be conscious.   And i doesn't behaves like the brain, at all.\ntreelovinhippie: &gt; Just because cause uncoordinated actions can lead to intelligent behavior it doesn't mean it will be conscious.\n\nYou could say that about the human brain now. It comes down to whether you think consciousness is an emergent property from the interactions of neurons or if something mystical or quantum is happening.\n\nAlso think of each computer on the Internet as a neuron. Or imagine you're an extraterrestrial looking at what we primitive human creatures have made. Really the Internet is just a network with flowing electrical pulses in a structure very similar to a brain.\n[deleted]: I read a paper about emergent behavior a long time ago, I don't remember the guy's name. I do remember that the uncoordinated actions have some sort of feedback with the environment and they have rules of interactions. The \"intelligent\" behavior is a reflection of those rules.\n\nThe reason why I said is a long shot it is because, the rules of interaction are different in the brain and in the Internet. So far, we have only encountered one thing capable of creating consciousness and that's our brain. Since, the rules of interaction between neurons is different than the rules of interaction between terminals, then brain has a different emergent behavior than the Internet. \n\nAlso, emergence only explains why some things exhibit intelligent behavior. It does not guarantee that such behavior will happen and whoever came up with it had a pretty loose definition of \"intelligent behavior\".\n\n\n\nTuril: We can't even define consciousness in any way that even the experts agree on, so there's no way we can ever accurately say that humans are the only ones with consciousness. :-)\n", "prompt": "jericho2291: The brain and intelligence.\nSo a few weeks ago I watched the movie \"Waking Life\" and one lecture about our \"sense of self\" has been on my mind ever since.

{"full_text": "Alex_Sheremet_Writes: Philosopher discusses John Cage's 4'33\" as Art, gets bogged down by everything but the obvious.\n\nmartinze: I think that your title is correct but not for the reasons that you stated in your comment. Let me explain.\n\nI was a child during the 1960's. At that time I was exposed to what I later considered to be the last vestiges, in the form of humor, of a particular cultural meme. This meme probably originated in the 1920's or the 1930's as a reaction to the proliferation of \"modern art\" following the first world war. Dada, surrealism, cubism, etc. This meme as I was exposed to it consisted of variations of the sentence: \"I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.\"\n\nLater when I attended college I was exposed to people speaking about works of art such as those classified as abstract expressionism saying things like, \"I don't consider that to be Art.\" and \"My four year old child could have done that.\"\n\nAs I thought about this I came to the conclusion that people were using the word \"art\" not as a classification of human activity but as a word indicating a value judgement. In other words, \"I don't consider a work to be 'Art' unless I consider it to be good art\". This, it seems to me to be a needless contortion. A work of art shouldn't need to be good art to be considered art. The same should be said for music.\n\nArt and music has utility other than being displayed in a gallery or played in a concert hall. Theater and film make use of art and music that only rarely is allowed to stand on its own. How much of contemporary film music is influenced by Bartok and Stravinsky? \n\nIn your comment you mentioned \"The Rite Of Spring\". Are you aware that when it premiered in Paris in 1913 it so scandalized the audience that it nearly caused a riot?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring\n\nNow we have incorporated the music of Le Sacre du Printemps into our expectations but when it was heard for the first time the audience had no referent for it. It violated their expectations just  as 4\"33' violates yours.\n\nA theory of art that I once read, I think that it is from the 19th century, is that artists teach us how to be aware. Painters teach us how to see. Musicians teach us how to hear. Actors teach us how to behave. Architects teach us how to live in our space. And so on. By that criteria I think that John Cage and 4\"33' has much to teach us.\nmaximinus-thrax: I love 4\"33' as a conceptual piece (a perfect piece of music, almost literally), but often people ridicule it. Better to pose the question \"Have you ever been in a place or situation where you would like to have heard it?\" and actually, a lot of people *would* have like to have silence at some time.\n\nThe only thing I *don't* like about the piece is that Cage did in fact write a score, complete with time signatures, tempo changes and so on. The pure emptiness of a page would be better, IMHO.\nogcllr: There are no tempo changes in any of the several versions of the score of 4'33\".\n\nIn fact, everyone reading this thread would to well to at the very least read the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3) on the subject.  There's a lot of misinformation already.\npyxlated: &gt;In 1951, Cage visited the anechoic chamber at Harvard University. An anechoic chamber is a room designed in such a way that the walls, ceiling and floor absorb all sounds made in the room, rather than reflecting them as echoes. Such a chamber is also externally sound-proofed. Cage entered the chamber expecting to hear silence, but he wrote later, \"I heard two sounds, one high and one low. When I described them to the engineer in charge, he informed me that the high one was my nervous system in operation, the low one my blood in circulation.\"[14] Cage had gone to a place where he expected total silence, and yet heard sound. \"Until I die there will be sounds. And they will continue following my death. One need not fear about the future of music.\"[15] The realisation as he saw it of the impossibility of silence led to the composition of 4\u203233\u2033.\n\nI hadn't known about this bit of context before, and I think it goes a long way towards clarifying the meaning of the piece. There is only silence in death, and not even then, as the small sounds of decomposition continue without our attendance. The relative quietness of a hushed concert hall would not be true silence, but an allusion to its unattainability.\nNeiliusAntitribu: &gt;  I think it goes a long way towards clarifying the meaning of the piece.\n\nIf you have to be told the meaning does that not invalidate it as a work of art?\n\nEDIT: I mean shouldn't the meaning of \"true\" art (meh true Scotsman) be completely subjective to an outsider (someone other than the creator)? As an example sometimes people ask me why I'm listening to \"sad\" music... while it doesn't evoke sadness in me. To me it suggests that a work of art should evoke an emotional response. A blank canvas let's my mind fill it in, and I become the artist, and whatever I feel comes completely from within. A silent song let's my mind fill it in, and I become the artists, and whatever I feel comes completely from within. \n\nIf I enjoy 4'33\", or a blank canvas, aren't I really just being vain? Literally just enjoying my own thoughts? Is that art?\npyxlated: Nothing in the world has any intrinsic meaning outside of what we ascribe to it. (As far as we know, anyway.) So when I said \"meaning,\" I really should have used the word \"intention.\" All art is in tension between the intentions of its creator and the interpretations of its audience, and context (for instance, the story of the anechoic chamber, the way the art is presented, the world events of the time, etc) is the lexicon we use to navigate that relationship. The more context we have, the better we can improve communication between creator and audience. It is the creator who determines whether it is art, but it is the audience which ultimately controls the interpretation of its meaning. Like meaning, there is no such distinction as intrinsically *good* or *true* art, but there is art which attracts the attention of more people, creates greater controversy, enables greater discussion of an idea, etc. This is one such work of art, I think, because decades later we are still discussing it and creating meaning within its empty frame.\nNeiliusAntitribu: This is art.\nNeiliusAntitribu: Is my last post art just because I said it was art? How about my next post:\nNeiliusAntitribu: This is not art.\nNeiliusAntitribu: Can there be any debate on which one of those two posts is actually art?\npyxlated: There can be debate on any subject two people wish to debate about. You could argue that you do not intend for your second post to be art, and I would find it amusing that it still serves to provide context to your first post, which is only art if you want it to be, which you don't. \"Art\" isn't a platonically exclusive category with clean edges, enshrined by the fabric of reality itself, it's a word used to describe an intention or an idea. Like anything else man-made, it is not perfect, and [a great deal of effort has been expended to criticize its boundaries.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-art)\nNeiliusAntitribu: For the record when I said \"This is art.\" I was being an artist so that was art. When I said \"This is not art.\" I guess I was doing what the French guy was doing, and it was also art.\n\nIt seems like the more people discuss art the more the concept of it seems to fall apart because it's so subjective. Someone makes art saying it's not art, but it is, but it isn't. Someone doesn't make art, but someone says it is, so it is, but it isn't because the creator didn't say it was. \n\nHowever, I would argue that nobody seriously sets out to make \"ugly\" paintings, songs, sculptures, etc. I think artists try to achieve beauty, whatever that means to them. I also think beauty can be quite subjective. You know the old saying about it being in the eye of the beholder.\n\nIn that regard, unfilled mediums are not art. I cannot call myself a sculptor and present you with a natural block of granite as a piece of artwork. I have to alter the medium. Silence/ambience is a medium for music in the same regard a canvas is the medium for painting or a chunk of granite the medium for a sculptor.\n\nThe blank canvas, and silent song are just as absurd to me as a large naturally occuring rock being called a scuplture.\n\nAs an apprentice goldsmith I can't simply take a chunk of pre-fab ring wax block, invest it, fire it, and cast it in gold and say it's art. That is completely disingenuous IMHO.\npyxlated: &gt;nobody seriously sets out to make \"ugly\" paintings\n\nNo, I assure you many people try to do exactly that. A lot of confrontational art is about ugliness, and it's deliberately made to be displeasing on every level. I once attended a showing by an artist who worked entirely in rotten hotdogs, and it was pretty clear they wanted the experience to be unaesthetic in every way possible. (It was pretty effective. I couldn't even look at a hotdog for a year afterward. That *smell,* ugh.) By trying to rank art according to its attractiveness, you run into the problem that not everyone agrees on what is attractive, and frequently attractiveness is genuinely not the artist's intention. Just try talking about music in any group larger than three people, and you'll discover intractable disagreements about everything from band to genre.\n\nWhat you have instead are different realms or disciplines of art, where it is classified according to its intentions. \n\nFor instance, I'm an illustrator, and I studied under a design discipline, which is based around A) understanding how imagery is [subconsciously interpreted by a viewer,](http://graphicdesign.spokanefalls.edu/tutorials/process/gestaltprinciples/gestaltprinc.htm) B) creating within the constraints of producing a product for a client or market, and C) gaining the skills necessary to accomplish both A and B. And of course, you have ever more specific sub-disciplines within that, depending on the style or market. The things I must consider in my work are often very different from those considered by (for instance) a performance artist with a BFA, who is focused on theory and historical context and needn't concern themselves with clients or marketability. Both are art, and both set out to accomplish different goals, but neither is innately more valuable than the other.\nNeiliusAntitribu: To me this seems like you're just saying everything observable is art. The basic premise being at least one person has to call it art, and then *poof* like a magic spell it becomes true.\n\nI humbly disagree.\n\nAn [unadulterated](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unadulterated) medium not art. Even if you or I claim it is art. It is not art.\n\nThe thing about 4'33\" that sort of annoys me is that there is an entire ambient musical genre, and it is quite obvious that 4'33\" doesn't fall into that genre.\n\nI guess in very simple terms IMHO \"nothing\" isn't art. I cannot help but reiterate my feelings that if someone enjoys 4'33\" or the blank canvas they are practicing vanity.\npyxlated: Like I said, art is an idea, not an immutable property of matter. What else is required for an idea to exist than to have it, and share it?\nNeiliusAntitribu: No. Ideas are ideas. Art has immutable properities as I described. Art could maybe be said to be an idea translated to form, but it is completely seperate from an actual idea.\n\nAn unadulterated medium will never be art. \"Nothing\" is and never will be art.\n\n\npyxlated: Why not?\nNeiliusAntitribu: Because if unadulterated medium is art then everything is art. Everything is not art just as much as \"nothing\" is not art.\npyxlated: And why not? I can easily imagine all sorts of ways in which someone could create art out of everything or nothing. It is only necessary to communicate or experience that idea. I once saw a guy free-climb a skyscraper as art. Someone else staged a repeating event in a coffee shop to see how long it took customers to notice that events were looping back on themselves. Others take drugs and contemplate the experience. Others isolate themselves and contemplate emptiness. There have been gallery showings in which nothing was displayed. There have been gallery showings in which the only thing displayed was a written rationale by the artist. Why can't these things be art?\nNeiliusAntitribu: &gt;There have been gallery showings in which the only thing displayed was a written rationale by the artist.\n\nWriting is something. Nothing is nothing, and not something one can claim to have creative ownership rights over.\n\nThe act of creating a work requires adulterating a medium.\n\nAs an example, please explain to me the logic and reasoning you have behind this concept of you picking up a rock (that *nature* produced), and claiming copyright over it as a work of art representing your sculpting abilities.\n\npyxlated: That is called [Found Art.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_object) Like other forms of art where the artist doesn't directly create something, the art isn't necessarily the rock itself so much as the framed experience of interacting with it. This has overlap with mediums such as performance art.\nNeiliusAntitribu: I read the article and it doesn't answer the question I asked of you.\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt;Found object originates from the French objet trouv\u00e9, describing art created from undisguised, but often modified, objects or products that are not normally considered art, often because they already have a non-art function.\n\nCan you please answer my previous question? You didn't explain your logic and reasoning, and the article you link suggests that \"found art\" is still *created* using other *products*.\n\nCreating and producing is adulterating a medium. Please refer to my previous post and provide me with your logic and reasoning why something not created by a human, not produced by a human, not adulterated by a human is art.\n\npyxlated: Because it is framed as such. \n\nLook, we've been talking in circles for two days now, I'm beginning to despair of satisfying your need for discrete platonic categories. Art is an incredibly broad concept, which is unsurprising since it is understood and appreciated differently from one person or culture to the next. You're trying to quantify a wholly abstract concept. Ideas are plastic things, vehicles for thought rather than objects you can pick up and handle. You're free to create an exclusive definition of art with boundaries that satisfy your desire for objectivity, but it will not be a definition shared by everyone.\nNeiliusAntitribu: No you look: you've dodged my question twice. Either you cannot explain your logic and reasoning because it is flawed, or you have none.\n\nFrom my view, as the son of a master goldsmith, my father would be considered a con if he tried to pass off a chunk of unadulterated gold ore as something he created.\n\nHe has to smelt the gold, alloy it down, adulterate it into a form that *he* feels represents his ideas as the *artist*.\n\n\"Nothing\" isn't art. Nature isn't an artist. An unadulterated medium isn't art, and on this specifically anyone claiming so is simply practicing vanity as I explained previously.\npyxlated: I have answered it, and you are unsatisfied with that answer. I'm simply tired of going in circles over it.\nHave a good day.\nNeiliusAntitribu: No you didn't provide anything close to answers. At best you provided a single link that also didn't answer anything. You dodged the question three times in a row.\n\nSaying you answered it certainly doesn't satisfy anything, and now you're copping out saying you're tired of going in circles (which you weren't; it seemed like you thought you had something).\n\nI've think I've explained my logic and reasoning well enough, and all you can really come up with is \"I disagree\". You just can't explain why you disagree, which I find disappointing for someone so intent on proving me wrong.\n\nGood day madam.\n", "prompt": "Alex_Sheremet_Writes: Philosopher discusses John Cage's 4'33\" as Art, gets bogged down by everything but the obvious.\n\nmartinze: I think that your title is correct but not for the reasons that you stated in your comment.

How do they matter in calculating how many representatives each **person** gets?  Sure, voters get to pick *which* people represent them, but not how many.  Your illegal/legal immigrant/citizen status matters not for how many representatives you get.\nBigHanksHalfaTank: &gt;Who cares about the voting population?  How do they matter in calculating how many representatives each person gets?\n\nBecause... uh.. that's what the census is used to determine. Representatives in accordance to their constituents. The constituency is the voting body. Undocumented individuals, however free, are not free to vote in the United States. So there's that.\n\nEdit: If you wanna make the case for undocumented people voting - that's fine and dandy. But that's not the topic of this CMV.\nMaestro_Primus: I'm not making the case for undocumented people voting.  Lets get that out of the way right now.  I'm stating the fact that according to Article 1, Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, the Constitution does not care at all about your ability to vote when determining how many representatives your state gets.  It is based on how many free people live in the state minus non-taxed Indians plus 3/5 of the slaves.  That's it.

{"full_text": "Rebbitman: CMV: Japan was right to specifically exclude artwork in its recent \"child pornography\" ban. The U.S. should follow its lead.\nPretty sure this is one of those \"&lt; popular opinion &gt;\" ones, just curious if anyone disagrees with this.\n\nSo, for about 15 years it was legal to possess CP in Japan. You couldn't make it, or distribute it, but if you had it saved all you really had to say was \"I got it from some other guy\" and send police off in another direction. Obviously this is problematic, and it becomes hard to accurately enforce a law like this. Recently they passed a law that banned possession too, bringing Japan in line with most of the world. However, in the interest of protecting freedom of expression they made it clear that animated comics, 3D images/video and OVAs featuring animated minors were not criminalized.\n\nNow, I think we all agree that there's a big difference between animated pics and the real deal. My claim here is about Japan specifically saying \"animation does NOT count\". This has a key effect: it protects the makers and consumers of material in which there is no victimization. In many places in the US, even if these animated materials are not outright banned the law is worryingly vague on the issue. If LEO wanted to, they could decide to enforce \"obscenity\" law on citizens at their own discretion. It's reasonable to expect that if you put an animated picture of porn (let alone porn with someone who is seemingly a minor) in front of a bunch of [WASP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant)s or WASPish people, they will declare it obscene and disgusting. Thus, the work is not protected and you could be imprisoned for it. \n\n&gt; \"Come on, how many people has that actually happened to? 4? 5 maybe?\"\n\nI'm not sure, but this argument is based on what *should* be and not the practical effect of the law. IIRC, up until a decade ago there were still places where it was a crime to have gay anal sex. I bet hardly anyone was ever caught and punished with this law, but that didn't mean it was okay for the law to exist. A shitty law shouldn't' be supported just because it doesn't have a big effect on people.\nDHCKris: I somewhat agree with you, but just for kicks let me try to hash out what is at play here.\n\nFirst of all, you are saying that animated CP is a-okay because there is no actual victim. This seems to me to indicate that you are saying that pedophilia and everything related to it should be completely legal until an actual human child is involved. This also suggests that you feel that the law should not invade people's lifestyles, even if they're considered disgusting or abhorrent, as long as they are not actually harming others.\n\nBut I suppose that someone who was against the distribution of animated CP would say, well, no, we should pursue people who trade in fictitious sexual scenarios with children just the same because we need to get them help before their behavior does turn into something unhealthy. It is arguably unhealthy at that point, even. Because of this, I think that animated CP should be a lesser offense than actual CP, if we take into account an arrest for possession as a means of getting the person psychological help and away from potential victims, rather than a strict punishment.\nIronicButterfly: &gt; But I suppose that someone who was against the distribution of animated CP would say, well, no, we should pursue people who trade in fictitious sexual scenarios with children just the same because we need to get them help before their behavior does turn into something unhealthy.\n\nWho says the behavior will ever turn into something unhealthy? I'm thinking about this like drug addiction. Just like the fact that not everyone that drinks alcohol drives drunk, not everyone that does heroin steals for money, not everyone that gets off to animated CP goes out and molests children.\nheshl: &gt; not everyone that does heroin steals for money\n\nHeroin addicts are walking crime sprees dude.\n\nIronicButterfly: Not all heroin users are addicts, and not all heroin addicts are junkies.\nheshl: They're not addicts or junkies yet. Opiates creep up on you.\n\nIronicButterfly: And if you're mindful and careful, you can keep yourself from getting to that point.\nheshl: Have you ever done opiates?\n\nThey seem like the most innocuous thing in the world.

It's their life and they can live as they please. Your dose of reality should be to understand that every life has a different set of circumstances. Including differing beliefs as well as what defines happiness and success. \n\nHow you see someone's life does not always sync up with how they view it. \naidrocsid: &gt;It's their life and they can live as they please.\n  \nNo, they can't. That's the point. They can *try* to live it as they please, but success it not guaranteed. If you can't sing *at all* and your only dream in life is to be a professional singer, you need a new dream. If the only thing in the world you want to do is be a physicist but you can't do math to save your life, you *don't* get to be a physicist. \n  \nNow personally, I'm not one to tell people they suck at things unless they're posing me an immediate danger. Is it because I'm super nice all the time and would never dream of saying something unkind? No. It's because I'm selfish and lazy. I don't want to deal with the social consequences of honesty about things that don't affect my life. I don't need to tell you you're completely unskilled at a given thing and incur the defensive reaction it will provoke if your lack of skill doesn't affect my life. It's generally going to be a waste of my time and my emotional energy, gaining me *nothing*. \n  \nThe best thing I could do for *you* though, would be to tell you. \"Don't quit your day job\" is quite often a damn sound piece of advice. Sometimes it's the wrong advice too. That's the chance you take when you give advice. At any rate, though, if you *are* right and you *know* you're right, you'd be doing the person a service by telling them. It might change their life. If you tell somebody they smell bad they may feel immediately poorly, but in the future they may feel better because their social interactions won't be unknowingly tarnished by their nasty odor.\n  \nIt's counter-intuitive, but what we consider to be nice is actually less helpful and more selfish in this case than what we might consider rude or at least forward. \nThe_Texican: The hell they can't.  that is what free will is all about.  It doesn't matter how you rationalize it, you don't get to live someone else's life for them.  If it is affecting you in some fashion, fine then you can tell them they are offending you.  But that doesn't mean you get to live their life.  \n\nI think you misconstrue being offended as giving you rationale to judge another's life.  \naidrocsid: Of course they can't. You ever been on the street? Ever talk to some homeless people? Ask them what they want out of life? It's sure as shit not what they're having, I'll tell you that. You *can't* do what you like unless you have the means. Again, you have the *freedom* to attempt to do what you like, but there is by no means any *guarantee* that it will happen. \n  \nPositive thinking is a great way of not being upset, it's not a great way of not being homeless. It guarantees nothing but a positive outlook. The real world still exists, and in the real world there are barriers between us and what we want that we have to be able to actually be capable of removing (or having removed for us) before we can get there. \nThe_Texican: Using homeless is a poor example due to not knowing the nature of their situation.  you don't know if they chose to live that way or are in that state due to having some mental illness where they do not function within the norms of society.\n\nMine is a simple statement.  You don't get to live your life through another.  You don't get to make their choices for them.  If you believe so then you are the one with the problem, not someone trying to live their own life as they see it.\naidrocsid: It's not a poor example because I know *intimately* how quite a number of people became homeless, including myself. I've *been* homeless. I know quite a lot about *many* homeless people and thankfully many more formerly homeless people because they are and were my friends. \n  \nYour simple statement is based on a strawman. Nobody's suggesting that they get to live their lives through other people. What's being said is that blind pursuit of passion is bullshit and that people *aren't* always able to do everything they want. Now you can take your positive thinking as far as you want in your life, but you *don't* get to erase the struggles of other people simply because you've apparently had it so easy that you don't even understand the concept of not getting what you want. There are too damn many of us and we won't let you. \nThe_Texican: Mine is not based on strawman.  \n\nAs someone that has not ever been homeless and worked my way through life I find your last statement absurd.  \n\n\naidrocsid: Of course you do, because things have never fallen apart for you. \nThe_Texican: I've had plenty of rough times, just because you have also does not make you an expert, nor does it lend credence to your argument. \naidrocsid: Anyone who doesn't have the Secret crammed half-way up their ass should have no trouble with it. \n", "prompt": "Piper007: Mike Rowe\u2019s response to an Alabamian who asked why he shouldn\u2019t follow his passion\n\nsandhouse: I feel the same way Rowe does and it makes me cringe all the time especially when I see young people going the wrong way, clearly not having the talent for whatever they're", "orig": "putting their money and effort into.

One thing that really stuck out to me is that most restrooms here don't have paper towels or an electric hand dryer.  I didn't really know what to think, and I spent the first few weeks drying my hands on my hair, (killing two birds with one stone by conveniently styling it at the same time, haha) or on my pants.  Then I happened to be in the bathroom at the same time as one of my coworkers and I had to wait while he washed his hands before me.  Lo and behold, he pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket and dries his hands before leaving...  I was speechless!  Such a simple solution that solves many problems and is environmentally friendly as well.  Think about how many rolls of paper towel are used in every US bathroom every year...  Long story short - carry a handkerchief to dry your hands instead of using paper towels.  Other benefits include:  wiping your brow while performing stressful tasks, use as a pocket square in a pinch (if it looks nice and isn't too dirty), or blowing your nose when absolutely necessary.\nClintHammer: How is that environmentally friendly?  Paper is a farmed product.  The trees they grow for paper are grown for paper.  If you reduce demand for paper, you reduce the number of trees.\n\nThe only reason people say paper is bad for the environment is because to make the nice white paper that people like to print things on, the pulp has to be thoroughly treated with chemicals.  Brown men's room towels don't.  \n\nAlso your \"lifehack\" is carry a handkercheif?  That's not what a lifehack is, you dope.  That's a \"thing I like to do\" \nsupersasuke: I get your point about paper being a farmed product and that cutting down on using tons of it in bathrooms might not technically be any better for the environment, however, I was merely pointing out a very simple (maybe obvious) use of a handkerchief that anyone can choose to start implementing.  I also want to point out that cutting down on the amount of paper towels used will reduce the amount of plastic trash bags used in bathrooms as well, because without the trash constantly filling up, there is less of a need to empty it regularly.  My observation was simply that I never see people in the US carrying or using handkerchiefs, and it seems to be a staple EDC item in India.  I'm sorry if I offended your definition of a \"lifehack\", I just wanted to point out a difference in culture that I noticed that may appeal to certain people who don't find satisfaction in wiping their hands on paper towels every time they visit a restroom...\nClintHammer: &gt; I was merely pointing out a very simple (maybe obvious) use of a handkerchief\n\n\nYeah, you suggested someone use something for its intended purpose. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OFi6aaV.png \nsupersasuke: You got me.

You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.

You can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/26wgbe/has_equal_chance_technology_created_by_us_ruined/chvvwrv). It explains how free will is possible even though we follow physical laws.\nsoonandsoforthsir: I read it and I stand by what I say.\n\nIt is silly for me to honestly discuss free will if I honestly don't think it exists.\n\nWhat I meant earlier with the brain chemistry thing is; if all the different particles/molecules whizzing around in your brain is what make up thoughts, and those particles/molecules follow the same rules in your brain as the same type of particles would outside of your brain whence cometh free will?\n\nApparently I'm really having a hard time explaining what I mean, so I'll try with another thing:\n\nThe big bang happened, all the stuff that was there, from it's inception, followed the rules of the universe. Sub-atomic particle A from over here ends over there 10 minutes later because of gravity, electromagnetic force etc etc. Now, all this stuff happens for a lot of years, and planets start to form because af gravity and all that. Some stuff gets stirred up in some water and life gets created or whatever. That life evolves following those very same rules (I doubt if you would claim that a plant has free will, so how far up the animal chain does free will begin?), a human is born and it is the same story.\nThe human just follows all the rules on a microscopic level and otherwise.\n\nMy point being that life is just like a machine who's component parts accidentally fell into place so that it could/would use energy to move around and procreate and such.\n\nHence: free will doesn't exist.\n\nbtw really liking this discussion! I've had my thoughts on free will for a long time, but this discussion has forced me to try to reason my thoughts out even more, which is nice :)\nyourlycantbsrs: It's shameful how much you've thought on your own about this and how little you've read about this.\nsoonandsoforthsir: You're calling me stupid, right?\nyourlycantbsrs: No, I'm calling you unreliable. When forming a belief on a complicated subject, thinking on your own is not the best method.\nsoonandsoforthsir: So where am I going wrong, if you chose to be constructive and were to help me along?\nyourlycantbsrs: I've already said where you're going wrong, in your process for coming up with your belief.\n\nI'd remedy this situation by taking a look at some SEP entries on free will, compatibilism, and determinism. Maybe post in askphilosophy and ask for other sources.\nsoonandsoforthsir: It seems to me you aren't quite coming out and saying what you actually mean. Have I said something that was wrong? Tell me what it is. Do you think I'm an idiot? Tell me why.\n\nIs it because I don't use academic lingo but what I'm saying makes sense? Then you are just being a snob.\nyourlycantbsrs: &gt;It seems to me you aren't quite coming out and saying what you actually mean. \n\nI actually mean that it's clear that you haven't read much if anything on these topics and that this method is unreliable when it comes to having justified views on complicated issues. I am being very clear in saying this.\n\n&gt;Have I said something that was wrong? Tell me what it is.\n\nListen, pal, other people can't do all the mental legwork that is necessary for you to have justified views. You need to realize that ultimately nobody is responsible for you having justified views except yourself. You need to realize that *you're on the internet* and you are *capable of doing research*. I really hope this doesn't sound harsh. If someone went into r/physics and posted a personal idea that they had after reading a wiki page on QM then thinking long and hard about it, they'd probably get told \"hey, there are better resources where you can learn about this stuff, use them before you come to conclusions\". And that would be exactly the right response.\n\nYou need to understand that philosophy and *pretty much every other discipline* is like this. Nobody thinks by themselves in a vacuum and come up with strong views unless they're some kind of prodigy hypergenius.\n\n&gt;Do you think I'm an idiot? Tell me why.\n\nNo, I just think that you're here for the wrong reasons. I think that lots of people look into philosophy and think about philosophy because they want to feel deep and smart. But that's not the goal of philosophy so if those are your goals, you're going to be doing some bad philosophy. In fact, your initial post was ripe for /r/badphilosophy... \n\n&gt;Is it because I don't use academic lingo but what I'm saying makes sense? Then you are just being a snob.\n\nUh, academic lingo is important when discussing academic topics. It clears up confusions and avoids drawn out explanations of terms. It's not being a snob, it's just expecting that interlocutors would be willing to take the time to familiarize themselves with such helpful terms before entering the conversation. \nsoonandsoforthsir: So I was skimming through the free will entry on wikipedia, and there are apparently also groups of academics that don't believe compatibility is a possibility which I guess means they don't believe free will exists.\n\nI'm saying free will doesn't exist. I'm doing it in layman terms, but I believe I have sound reasoning, so why shouldn't I be allowed to comment if I want too?\nyourlycantbsrs: Why are you skimming wikipedia for philosophy? I already pointed you towards resources. Start here: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/ and here: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/\n\n&gt;there are apparently also groups of academics that don't believe compatibility is a possibility which I guess means they don't believe free will exists.\n\nAnd....? I never said it's not a justifiable position. I just said you've clearly done a poor job of justifying it in your case.\n\n&gt;I'm saying free will doesn't exist. I'm doing it in layman terms, but I believe I have sound reasoning, so why shouldn't I be allowed to comment if I want too?\n\nEarlier in the thread you said this:\n\n&gt;btw really liking this discussion! I've had my thoughts on free will for a long time, but this discussion has forced me to try to reason my thoughts out even more, which is nice :)\n\nThis attitude is very, very irksome for me. I'm thoroughly confused at how anyone who *actually wants to know about the topics* would decide that having conversations with random people on the internet is a good method. \n\nAsk yourself this: what's your primary goal here? Is it actually knowing about the topic? Then read more and write/discuss less. Is it feeling deep and smart and having awesome internet discussions that give you those warm fuzzy intellectual feels? Then keep spouting naive determinism and be thankful that your thoughts aren't being graded. Your ideas would get bad grades because they're *lazy*. You haven't looked into the topic much at all before talking about it a lot.\nsoonandsoforthsir: This is so funny the last part. I read The New Rhetoric a long time ago and that is also one of the things I took with me from that book.\n\nOne of my points was, what I think is a very olskool philosophical tradition, that through reasoning one can get to interesting conclusions.\n\nI know about compatibilism and like I said I think it's bullshit.\n\nI'll admit to being lazy when writing my idea down, but it is quite simple: that every step from subatomic particles to molecules to life, human beings and their psyches are consequences of physical laws, and thusly not free. Hence me writing that free will doesn't exist.\n\nI think the reason why I choose to answer is because it annoys me that free will continues to pop up in this thread, because I think people who actually think free will exists are arrogant, and speciesist. Typical thinking that people are better than animals and plants and what not, and I think it's ridiculous.\n\nNow the fact that you are trying to close my opinion down because it isn't based on something a philosopher has said, well that just shows that you are also arrogant in that sense.\nlapse_of_taste: &gt; that every step from subatomic particles to molecules to life, human beings and their psyches are consequences of physical laws, and thusly not free. Hence me writing that free will doesn't exist.\n\nI want to restate something that was also mentioned in the thread I linked to: When we say something like \"the prisoner is now free\" or \"the slave achieved freedom\", we take *free* to mean something specific. We don't mean that the former prisoner is now free to jump up and fly or the slave is now free to drink up the sea. \n\nLikewise, when we say that someone committed a murder out of free will, we mean that the murderer was not brainwashed, drugged or forced to kill by someone holding a gun at her head. We thus declare the murderers actions blameworthy and say that she was morally responsible. Under your view of free will, we cannot assign moral blame or praise to anybody. There is no moral responsibility without free will.\n\n&gt; I think the reason why I choose to answer is because it annoys me that free will continues to pop up in this thread, because I think people who actually think free will exists are arrogant, and speciesist.\n\nNow, arguing that animals don't have moral status because they don't have free will isn't exactly popular in philosophy, so if that is your only reason to argue against free will, it's not a very good reason. But the bigger problem is that if there is no free will, we cannot blame humans for being cruel to animals, so if you are right, your reason to argue against free will is moot in the first place.\nsoonandsoforthsir: I am not talking about ethics, animal rights and so on. I am talking about the physical reality we are a part of.\n\nI understand from the link yourlycantbsrs has sent me that people pretty much only discuss this in regard to those subjects, but I am talking about actually being able to make choices in the first place.\n\nI believe that every action has a specific reaction based on physical laws. we might not understand all of them, but none the less.\nI believe that lifeforms from their genesis (badum tsss!) behaved non-randomly and like I said earlier even if the lifeforms become more complex, they still follow very strict rules from cell-mutations up to psychological 'choices'. In other words, that lifeforms are like automatons.\nlapse_of_taste: But the reason why the existence of free will is so relevant is because it is a necessary condition for moral responsibility. The fact that given the same physical laws and starting conditions, we would't have chosen differently doesn't mean that we did not deliberate and act on reasons. It is not at all clear why we need to be unmoved movers in order to have free will.\n\n&gt; In other words, that lifeforms are like automatons.\n\nThat seems completely trivial and not like a very interesting conclusion. It is trivial if \"automatons\" are all beings which act according to laws and don't violate the laws of physics, because unless you believe that there is some prime mover, pretty much every being in this universe is an automaton.\nsoonandsoforthsir: I don't believe there is a prime mover, and I also never said it was an interesting conclusion, but I do not think it is trivial at all, because my point is exactly that everything in existence is like a chain-reaction, even thoughts if they are bound in the physical world.\nIt isn't very flattering to us, but I think that that is the case, and I still haven't really heard a good argument for why that is not the case.\nlapse_of_taste: &gt; my point is exactly that everything in existence is like a chain-reaction, even thoughts if they are bound in the physical world.\n\nCompatibilists don't deny this. They don't need to argue against this in order to show how free will is possible.\nsoonandsoforthsir: Yeah, I read that. I guess I just understand the word/phrase weirdly then.

{"full_text": "RedDeadTed: This is Getting Out of Hand\n[Throwaway] I've managed to get by for most of my life with poor social skills and moderate social anxiety. But a recent experience with depression has put me in a worse place than usual with regard to social interaction. The problem is compounded by the fact that I'm now at an age (40) where social awkwardness really doesn't go down well among my peers. It's reached the point where otherwise friendly people quickly lose interest in interacting with me after a couple of initial encounters. I recognise at least some of the factors that I think contribute to this\u2014I tend to be low-energy and have poor conversational skills for my age. I really want to turn this around, but how?\nJuanChaleco: I'm completely in line with the idea of a life coach, this is a interactions problem and it can be fixed only with practice and more interactions (you got to keep your social skills at work, don't let them rust while you seat waiting for a solution, you are already reaching for help, and has long has you keep the attitude you are going up).\n\nBut a life coach can get pricey... \nSo i'll try to give you a lifeline here...\n\nIn my experience Social Anxiety comes mainly from the perception of yourself being not adequate in some measure (In communication skills, more than anything), mixed with a \"no failing, so i'wont act\" attitude...the last one, as i said in the first paragraph, must be solved by yourself, from your interest in getting better at social skills. But the one that gives you legs to run on your own are the the communication skills, from what i normally see in people with harsh Social Anxiety comes from one of two places... lack of listening/empathy/natural_reactions and/or erratic or unconnected responses from overthinking the social interaction. \n\nFirst you must loss the fear of failure in social situations, especially in informal situations. Don't be afraid to crash and burn something. Have fun with it, people around and you know that you are awkward, maybe your face turns red, you circle around ideas or come exceptionally slow or unconnected. But as long has you acknowledge it in the interaction and don't take it seriously you are getting better at it.  \n\nSecond you must pay attention to what the other person is saying and the situation you are in, and act accordingly, if you are not sure in how to react, show it and ask to the person you have in front of you (if the situation leaves you, if somebody died don't try to get out of that conversation playing), at least you are going to be honest even if it's awkward if you acknowledge. When you don't get something or you miss a cue, people see it in the moment or in a short amount of time during the same conversation, and if you don't acknowledge that, you are putting layers of awkwardness over your discourse that won't let you move later in that interaction, for that the best thing is empathy.\n\n\n\nThere are lots of yt channels and reading material in reddit for learning social skills, practice empathy and get examples of do and donts.\n\nSomething in my experience helps is listening to stand up comedians (the construction of the phrasing, the timings and the presentation of points and counterpoints) , they master conversational timings and awkwards communications management, those are great skills to learn in your situation... especially the ones that are politically incorrect or very opinionated...  Louie ck, Bill Burr, Joe Rogan, George Carlin... \n\nlot's of luck, and hope you can get comfortable.\n\n\nRedDeadTed: Thank you for your considered reply. Part of the reason I'm at this juncture now is because I did go through a period when I felt that the only thing I could do as a natural introvert was simply to accept my lack of ability as \"just the way things are\". I no longer want to feel that way, but I have to make up a lot of ground. Anyway, I appreciate the advice.\nJuanChaleco: 1-. We are not alone in this thing, life gets muuuuch better when you have people around you and you interact with them in a confident and enjoyable fashion.\n\n2-. Most probably you have some self confidence issue (probably because of this communication thing). So do the most with what you have, get better in being yourself (it should give you a good boost of morale and confidence)... eat healthy, do regular exercise, and be clean, keep an eye on your teeth and mouth... clean is the word... anything else is incidental like croqued teeths or \"weird features\" ... anything can be worked around or taken for what it is, anything but being unclean... is the root of a lots of evil in personal interactions (unleast you are a mute, in wish case keep your hands clean). Being unclean is offensive \"conscious\" constant communication signal. Maybe you are clean like a whistle, but this is the kind of thing better said that unsaid.\n\n3-. Communication is not ground to be covered, communication is a means to an end... Is like Mr Miyagi said... is not how much Karate you know, is how good the karate you know is... And the best way to better your karate is to give it an objective...  remember that in itself communication is meaningless... the end to communicate is information, connection, help, company, building empathy, build relations... i bet you have all of those in some measure, but the lines can get tenue with bad communication skills, that's what you are trying to do here, broaden those lines, have confidence in the little \"Karate\" you know and learn the ability, even with one punch you can knock someone... and remember that learning to have great communications skills for the fuck of it, if it don't add to your life, fuck it, is like learning Japanese and not plan to see anime, visit Japan or try to meet a Japanese girl... You must make it ADD to YOUR LIFE... this thing MUST help YOU.\n\n4-. Get some of your free time occupied with things that will force you to interact with people... go learn a language, go learn some cooking, enter a crossfit group, book club or something... force yourself to interact with people, and don't stand silently, emit your opinion, be polite and respectful but act... that is the work to be done right now, so stop procrastinating on it (even if you don't feel like it right now, and the sun is not quite up, and your shirt is not ironed to perfection) Just a hello in a not threatening situation and you are on your way... It might sound stupid but if you see somebody everyday, a cashier, the bus ride a neighbour, a \"nice enough coworker\", a \"very nice coworker\", an old friend... just an eye connection, a smile, a nod and a hello... that's it... build over that and you are going to be golden... You don't need to have a forum or a Shakespearean monologue occasion to prove your oratory abilities and Social Skills, everywhere is a great moment to practice if you get \"chatty\", if you are respectful, polite and positive almost no one will try to evade a conversation, and if they do, nothing to comment about it, maybe is not a great day for them, don't let it get to you...

I was thinking of Using a type of foam board but what would be the best way to go about it? \n\nI mean the simplist way would be foam board + liquid nails but I think there are better alternatives.

Also what type of foamboard do you think will be best. \n\nIs there a better way? \n\nEDIT - Also as far as finishing it sheetrock wise do I need to do anything special or can i just attach it to the foamboard? Assuming foamboard is best option.\n\nThanks DIY\n\nEDIT 2 - this is a tempt housing situation - 2-3 years maybe, So do not want to invest alot into it so outside work is more then likely out. As far as having the cinders filled, my neighbor had that done and its a waste of money. Here in AZ once summer hits it doesn't drop below 100 even just before the sun rises (coolest part of the night) for months on end. There is still enough mass in the cinder that is not insulated to have the same 100+ walls on the inside.\n\nEdit 3 - So the Foamboard Will give me the best R value per inch?  Thanks for the link for this old house. Thats basically what I was looking at doing as far as the foamboard goes. Then I can just add the wood strips and pull the electrical out another 3 or so inches and add the sheetrock. Do they make insulative sheet rock?\n\nTrying to get as much out of it as I can I really would like to stay 4 or less inches on each wall but If I need to do more I need to do more I guess. \n\n\nshuffler: Commercial insulation contractor here (not residential, but I hope I help), you have a variety of options:\n\n* if you do not want to do anything to the inside or outside, have an injection foam contractor come in and pump your cinder blocks full of insulating foam. \n\n* if you don't mind going on the outside of the house, I agree with SgianDubh in that you should put a radiant barrier on the outside of the house and then some sort of insulation on the inside of the house (foam in the blocks or fur out the interior). the radiant on the outside will reflect a good chunk (the 97% they claim is garbage) of the radiant energy hitting your south and west walls for heat gain, but doesn't help against the cold.\n\n* if you are furring out the inside, extruded polystyrene foam insulation will give you the most r-value per inch. It is my understanding that you can put the foam board directly against the block wall, tape the seams, foam the cracks at the bottom and top of the wall and it can be considered your vapor barrier. [You can see this done in a basement here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jSuWbdJy5A). For better or worse, I'm a believer in what Mike Holmes does.  The foam board will get you R-5 per inch where the fiberglass and cellulose is R-3. Keep in mind that the foam board will cost you much more than just glass or cellulose, but I think that it may work better for you. Once you have the board up and taped you can build your stud wall and insulate with fiberglass if you want. I would skip the vapor barrier with the stud wall. The trick of this is, like CvilleTallMan said, assuming that these walls are above grade and that you live in phoenix, moisture is not such an issue like it is here in the northern plains. You can probably just use a 6-mil poly over the studs with fiberglass you put in yourself or sprayed in cellulose by a contractor.  I'm just always worried that cellulose will settle. I have seen it happen too many times for it to be just a random occurrence. \n\n* do NOT glue your drywall to the block or foam board. Take the time to fur out a wall and run your outlets, etc.. You will thank me later.\nBowzer84: Expanded foam was my first thought too. seems like it would be relatively easy to pour/inject it right down into the cinder blocks.\nwickedpissa: you'll still have a crazy amount of thermal bridging reducing the insulating factors greatly.\nrcrracer: Test have proven your statement is correct.\n", "prompt": "zykal: Insulating a room that has  exterior hollow cinder walls 1950's construction\nI live in a house built in the 1950's in phx AZ I have 2 rooms that the south facing wall and a west and East facing wall in the respective rooms are bare Hollow cinder", "orig": ".

Which is just plain wrong as it is a year. And in 2014 and 2016 the year naming convention was not in place so viruses didnt get the designation with the year yet. So what COV must i be trying to get a paper on for 2014 or 2016?\n\nI'm so lost. Please can you link to the Scientific literature you talked about earlier, that way i can do my own research.\nthelukejones: As per previous reply I say its not 19.  If you cant read replies on twitter well I wouldn't suggest going any further. \n\nMaybe some professional help as you seem to have severe mental health issues. \nBut maybe your just trying to look like an autistic cunt too \ud83e\udd72\nCayowin: Wow. That took a turn, very aggressive response. \n\nIm sorry if you feel insulted somehow, I'm just attempting to understand your point you made when you said I should do some research.  \n\nI very rarely get my scientific data from Twitter. What handle/hashtag should i be looking for to get the most honest up to date info?\nthelukejones: As per above.  Also again recommend that mental health therapy as you seem unable to communicate well and seem to be developing ocd over this by replying without heeding the above advice.\nCayowin: What advice? The only thing i want from you is the link to the scientific data you claimed to have. \n\nThat's it. \n\nPut up or shut up. \n\nShow me your work or admit you were lying.\n\nI am pushing you because i would honestly love to see what data you use to make your claims. If you were just making it up as you were going along, thats fine, just let me know.\nthelukejones: Claimed the opposite you dull fuck.  Literally said I didn't have a link. Nor have I said its my work. If ur going to be a pedantic cunt in life atleast make sure ur right cos currently your still making urself look like a cunt, a stupid one at that. But if it helps www.google.co.uk now you can find your own links \ud83d\ude09\nCayowin: Ok, all you had to say is \"I have no basis for what i am saying other than my own opinion\" and \"when i said 'scientific papers' I was lying\" Thats all. \n\nNo need to be all shouty. It's getting a bit hot in the UK, you need to chill a bit.\nthelukejones: Not lying look up what I've said \ud83d\ude09\nCayowin: thelukejones\r  \n\u00b7\r  \n15 days ago\r  \nScientific literature.\n\nI did. You still havnt replied on what \"scientific literature\" you got your information from. You are still lying that there is any scientific literature to support your view on covid.\nthelukejones: Nah prev comments explain it go read them\nCayowin: Let me read through your comments anyway and paraphrase so we can remind ourselves how we got here. \n\nYou said, roughly, covid is nothing, i said \"oh where did you hear that?\" you said \"scientific papers\", i said \"oh which ones?\", you said \"twitter\", i said \"which handle/hashtag?\", you went on a rambling confused statement about covid versions, i pointed out thats not what the 19 in covid 19 means, you then swore at me and became very hostile. \n\nSo still cant point to what \"scientific papers\" you were referring to then?\n\nThat's all i want. Where you got your information.\nthelukejones: I've never said i got it from twitter, keep up the reading lessons ull get there\nCayowin: \"f you cant read replies on twitter well I wouldn't suggest going any further.\"\n\nthis you?\nthelukejones: I'm on about you cant read my replies you retarded fuckwit, which clearly, you cant.\nCayowin: \"on twitter\"\n\nSo what did you want me to read \"on twitter\"?\nthelukejones: My replies you fucktard.  You seem incapable of reading my replies and acting on them. Then u come back with nonsensical replies that clearly prove you aint read anything so bb\nCayowin: and all you do is insult me daily, is this some king of catharsis for you?\n\nSo i have read all your replies, i still don't know what science papers you found or why i should read your replies on twitter because your replies are nonsensical, linked only by misunderstanding and insults. \n\nSo please let us go back to the original statement you made, where specifically did you get your info that covid was a nothing burger?\nthelukejones: Explains in my replies\nCayowin: Thank you for replying and not using insults. \n\nMay i ask which reply that you have made, do you think best explains which scientific papers you read?\nthelukejones: I havent insulted you once you are genuinely thick as fuck. Facts are facts\nCayowin: \"I havent insulted you once\" you said. As well as typing out:\n\n\"you are genuinely thick as fuck.\"\n\n\"you dull fuck\"\n\n\" you retarded fuckwit\"\n\n\" pedantic cunt \"\n\n\" look like a cunt, a stupid one at that.\"\n\n\"you seem unable to communicate well and seem to be developing ocd \"\n\n\"Maybe some professional help as you seem to have severe mental health issues. But maybe your just trying to look like an autistic cunt too\"\n\nYou keep asking me to read your replies and i'm not sure if you can even remember what you have written. These are insults yes? You typed them out, then typed out \"i have not insulted you once\". Do you see the disconnect there? Or are  you just failing to be funny. Regardless, it does not matter. \n\nI only care about 1 thing, what scientific papers did you read?\nthelukejones: It's not an insult it's just facts. Read above it explains.\nCayowin: Where exactly?

{"full_text": "wrdsrindescribable: Help making retractable wings \"flip\" open\nHi /r/DIY!\n\nI'm in the process of building a jetpack for my Buzz Lightyear costume for this Halloween. I have been following [this instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Cardboard-Buzz-Lightyear-jet-pack-with-retractable/?ALLSTEPS) to build the jetpack and wings themselves, but I need help creating some sort of mechanism to get the wings to open without manually rotating them up of down.\n\nI'm thinking some type of pull-cord or rubber band assembly? I just don't know where to start!\n\nAny help would be great!\n\nThank you\nGorilla_My_Dreams: Open like a switchblade, or open like a pocket knife?\n\nGorilla_My_Dreams: Seeing now that you're using cardboard for the wings. Switchblade it is. Off the top of my head, I'd say easiest way would be to put them on drawer rails. \n\nIf you're tech-inclined, you could use an electromagnet to pulse them out, and that way you'd be able to do it with a switch, putting the battery inside the pack. \n\n\nIf you're not, the tensile strength of your wings is going to limit your options a bit. Anything you use to make them extend (spring, rubber band) will require you to push against it with the wings, which would almost certainly bend the cardboard and nobody wants to be Buzz Limpyear for halloween. \n\n\nThat said, springs with some sort of catch lever that grabs the drawer rails both in the retracted and extended position. \nwrdsrindescribable: Thanks!\n\nDo you think it's possible to have them open like a pocket knife? Even if I have to pull a string to open them and they don't \"flip\"\nGorilla_My_Dreams: Possible? Totally. Use a rib (piece of metal would be best, but wood is ok if you can't find metal) and set a bracket on the pack that they can hinge on. ~~Imagine this line below is the rib, and the O is the hinge~~. The string (or levering device) would go *inside* the hinge. The shorter the distance between the hinge and the string's contact point (up to a certain point; too close and it'll require too much torque) the faster your wings will pop up. \n\nKeeping them in place afterwards, however, is a little trickier. Again, off the top of my head, you could use some sort of clips with light springs to \"lock\" the wings in place; depressing them to get the wings back down would either necessitate another string, or for an adult to push them down so the ribs can bypass the clips. I realize this is a little abstract, so I'll upload a picture in a second of what I'm talking about. \nwrdsrindescribable: Thank you so much! A picture would be great!\nGorilla_My_Dreams: http://i.imgur.com/rowYU4m.jpg\n\nHopefully this makes things a little clearer, but the basic idea is you'll need a bracket to attach the wings to the pack; you'll want something that will allow a peg to swivel inside a groove of some kind. This is your point of contact between the rib and the backpack. \n\nThen you'll need a peg for the rubber band to hook onto; one on each wing, and one on the pack where I labeled it. You could just use one rubber band for this, and it should keep things simple. \n\nThe last thing you'll need (I didn't draw it in the picture because it would have been too messy) is a set of stopping blocks to keep the wings in place; for each wing, you'll want a block to hold the wing in place while it's down (this will resist the rubber band until you push the wing out so that it's no longer stopping the rib from rotating) and another to stop the wing at the ideal position (the rib will hit this and keep the wing in place). \n\nTo \"activate\" the wings, you'll just push the wings out a little to get them free of the first stopping block. It's not the most elegant design, but it will work and more importantly it's pretty simple. If you end up doing it this way, I'm sure you'll come up with improvements while you're building it. I hope this made sense. If you need any more help, feel free to ask. I hope your kid's halloween is awesome. \nwrdsrindescribable: One question. What is the bracket? And how does it work?\n\nThanks again!\nGorilla_My_Dreams: The bracket is something you'll have to find/make. It'll be a flat plate that can be attached firmly to the backpack. The top of the bracket should have a notch in it that can hold the hinge from the wing. This is basically the shoulder joint for the wings. You'll need one for each of the wings. Make sense?\nwrdsrindescribable: Ohh ok! I was thinking it was just one bracket for both wings! Makes more sense now! Thanks!\n\nIn the picture, do you have 2 rubber bands? Or is the one attached to the wing something else?\n\n~~I'll try to post a picture of what I'm thinking~~\n\nedit: I can't draw this! Sorry \nGorilla_My_Dreams: Sure thing. \n\nThe picture shows two rubber bands. You could do that, or just use one, which would ostensibly increase your tensile strength, and therefore make the wings pop up faster, which is obviously cooler. But since you're working with cardboard, there's a limit to what it will withstand. \nwrdsrindescribable: Sounds great!\n\nLast question (I hope), how do I attach the string?

{"full_text": "LosIsosceles: As schools reopen, we need to hope for the best but prepare for remote learning\n\nSnappaDaBagels: What's with all the shrill comments here? *\"Kids need to be in school!1!!\".* So insightful. \n\nLook. Any reasonable person understands the immense value of in-person learning. We've seen that the remote learning done in 2020 more or less failed. We know kids fell behind an average of 5 months of education. It's much worse for children who live in poor households, who don't have the infrastructure for remote learning, like internet, or a computer. We know children suffered mental and emotionally too. In-person learning should of course be a top priority. \n\nHowever, it's very possible the risk we're seeing from Delta might not make in-person learning an option. Frankly, the trends suggest this might be a reality. If it happens, school districts really need to have plans in place to do better than they did last year. There is so much we can do to avoid the negative educational and health outcomes caused during the last school year. \n\nThis article's points are smart, but require even more thought. Yes, schools should ensure remote-learning is possible from their students if that is part of their Delta contingency plan. But they also need to consider other variable. Are lesson plans appropriate? Is the technology supportive? \n\nAnd of course, they need to consider the health of students. How are schools emotionally and mentally supporting students if we go into lockdown?\nr0gu39: As a teacher - we know remote learning was less than stellar.  We know hybrid was difficult.  We know kids learn better in school.  This pandemic has taught me that everyone thinks they know how to do my job better than me - and yet know one is stepping up to be a teacher while states are hemorrhaging teachers.  I have learned that teachers (and schools to some extent) are expected to fill every role and solve every problem in a child's life while facing constant upheaval and criticism.\n\nAnd if we complain - tHiS iS wHaT yOu SiGnEd Up FoR!\nSnappaDaBagels: To a degree, yes, teachers are expected to fill every role in helping a child develop properly. And that is the job.\n\nWhere I see the failure is in how we support teachers. Providing the knowledge and tools to successfully teach in a Covid-19 world is the job of school administrators, all the way up to local, state, and federal governments.\n\nFor example, have you been giving extra guidance or training on how to teach remote? Did your district outfit you with the office setup and internet connectivity to do this? Were you students given the same treatment? \n\nI agree teachers face the brunt of criticism and that isn't fair. The people who need to do better aren't teachers, it's the folks planning and appropriating dollars behind them.\nr0gu39: To be honest - we were able to take laptops and our course textbooks home.  That was it.  We had some trainings, but most were on technology and programs many of us already used.  Our \"best practices\" PD was all window dressing and no substance.  Administration and government offered \"trainings\" that didn't apply or wouldn't actually work in practice - and that was all we got.\nSnappaDaBagels: Isn't that insane? Here you are being asked to do your job in a totally different way. And you get no support. Of course there will be failure. \n\nI don't fault school districts for failing in 2020. Everyone was trying to react to a changing world. \n\nBut I will fault districts in 2021. They've now had over a year to build up a process to teach in a Covid-19 world. We should expect they support teachers much more, and that this in turn makes the student experience that much better too.\nr0gu39: Hopefully they do offer more support.

These 3 bureaus allow you to \"freeze\" your reports, so that nobody can look at them and therefore nobody can take credit out in your name. This process must be done separately for the 3 bureaus and takes about 5 minutes each.\nSmartass_Narrator: Please, please, PLEASE understand that if you freeze your credit (which is just fine if that\u2019s what you want to do) then *everything* you apply for will be declined, including credit limit increase requests on your cards or new card applications. Don\u2019t get mad at the company for the decline. Freezing credit is usually done because of ID theft or concerns so if that freeze is on a report, it\u2019s an automatic decline, no ifs ands or buts. Should you decide you want an increase or a new card or loan, you have to unfreeze everything *first* and *then* apply. Give it a cycle (a full day) to clear just to be safe so there\u2019s not overlap between systems. I can\u2019t tell you how often I\u2019ve seen people livid about being declined for something despite their great credit score and then say yes when I ask if they\u2019ve ever frozen their credit followed by no when I ask if they ever unfroze it.\ntazmologist: I would argue that a byproduct of freezing your credit is that you have to be more thoughtful in it's use.  If you have to unfreeze before you apply for a credit card or an increase, you will take at least a moment to say \"Do I really need to do this\"?  At least that has worked for me and improved my credit score by 200 points in the last 2 years in the process.\nGoodAbbreviations164: I had my credit frozen for a few years.  It was great when you go to places like TJMaxx and they want you to apply for their card to save X% off today's purchase.  I just tell them my credit is frozen and they drop it.   It makes saying \"no\" much easier.  \n\nBut yes, when I was trying to get a car loan after my car had been totalled, it did add an extra layer of inconvenience trying to get that unfrozen for the day so they could inquire about my credit.    I am in the middle of a lot of change in my life, so when it's all back to boring every day is the same type of life, I will probably refreeze it.\nSmartass_Narrator: Yeah it\u2019s tough cuz the company can\u2019t even tell you upfront that the reason you\u2019re declined is because of a freeze. Logically, the consumer should know about the freeze and If it\u2019s frozen it means the person applying *could* be the baddie and not the actual person (who should know about the freeze\u2026. But maybe they forgot! So many variables!). The lender don\u2019t know! It\u2019s hard on everyone! So\u2026 decline. Better safe than sorry.

Then she kept doing that puppy head cock to each side.  Double adorableness.\n\nMy puppy watches videos on my phone with me.\nAnalogDan: My pibull was pretty sure I was watching a video of a dog dying. Very concerned. \nTheJonesSays: Normally not a huge fan of pittbulls but they can be adorable, too!  \nazgeogirl: Out of curiosity: have you ever had any interaction with a pit bull? Just wondering if you say you are not a fan because of a bad experience or because of something you saw online or tv. (Genuinely curious.)\nTheJonesSays: I grew up in a rural area.  No one had pit bulls.  Naturally aggressive dog in a town where little wander around?  Nope.  Some dobermans but they were always fenced in.  Love dobermans.  But pits?  The sentiment was not to take a chance.  I get that raised and trained right, they are awesome dogs.  But most owners of pits, especially in the City (where I live now), do not know how to train one correctly.  They get a bad rap because of their tendencies and bad owners.  But they are a naturally aggressive breed.\n\nI grew up with Golden Retrievers.  Much better around a family with small kids.  Goldens and labs, for instance, rarely lash out.  In comparison, I grew up in an area that you had no reason for aggressive dogs, so no one had them. \nArchnation: I have yet to meet a pit or pit mix that was mean. I bought into the hype too for a real long time. Then i realized i've been snapped at by a couple dogs in my life - none of them pits.\nTheJonesSays: My puppy snapped a few times right after I brought her home.  But she was about 3-4lbs at the time.  Too cute.\n\nIt's not hype and it's not embellishment.  Pits are naturally aggressive in comparison to other breeds.  Many owners don't know how to train such dogs.  It sucks because I've been around pits that only want pets and cuddles.  Bad owners + aggressive dogs = bad.\nMoral_Anarchist: Lots of breeds are more aggressive than pits, the difference is if a pit goes crazy it has the power to kill as opposed to nip somebody's leg...a chihuahua is much more likely to growl and bite somebody than a pit.  In the end it's not the breed, it's how it's raised.  Period.\n\nallanstrings: On large trend lines i would agree.  But i have known two very socialized and loving pits that i was not fearful of that had what could only be described as psychotic breaks, ending up injuring people badly. \n\nOne was 8 years old and had never shown any bad habits at all towards people or dogs. Master was sitting on their front porch reading a book with dog at his feet, when a kid on one of those razor scooters came by on the sidewalk at the far side of the street. Pit launched into a barking rage for no apparent reason and shot across his yard, jumped the front fence, crossed the street, and chomped down on the kid's leg. The owner was chasing trying to calm it down the whole time, and it took him a couple minutes to get the pit to release the boy's calf.\n\nThe other was passively sitting on the couch between her master and his wife (who had been there from birth and had no issues with it) when the wife leaned over to get up from the couch. For reasons only the dog knows, it took this as some kind of threatening display and ate her face. No warning, just lunge and shred. Poor lady needed multiple facial reconstructions.  This was a very well trained and (up to that point) loving pet. \n\nA lot of people may be turned off by the aggressive nature, but it is the unpredictability of them that makes me keep my distance.  It's kind of similar to keeping a gun in the house. With proper education and careful handling you won't likely ever have an issue, but if someone unfamiliar comes around, or you just get unlucky and drop it the wrong way, someone could get seriously hurt. \n\nThe difference is you can't just keep the dog in a gunsafe :)\nMoral_Anarchist: I guess what I was saying was that all dogs have a propensity to just go off at random times...most of the time we easily forget about it though because no real harm is done, just a comment \"he's never done that before\" and then back to whatever you were doing...the pit isn't more likely to actually do these things, but it's certainly going to be a much bigger deal if he does because of the sheer power factor.  \n\nA dog's bite is 6 times stronger than a person's bite, and a pitbull's bite is almost 6 times stronger than an average dog's bite.  So when the pit DOES go off it's a whole different situation than if a smaller dog does because people end up going to the hospital or dying\n\nI like your gun analogy...to continue in that vein a normal dog is like a handgun, a pit is more like a shotgun.  One isn't more likely to have an accident than another one, but if an accident DOES happen, it's gonna be much worse\n", "prompt": "statelessnfaithless: Dog Passes Out From Overwhelming Joy When This Girl Comes Home After Two Years\n\nTheJonesSays: I watched the video and my puppy was so concerned at first.

I suppose that torque calculations won't be straightforward given the complexity of the human body.\nThey_call_me_Doctor: There are some good books on the subject. I think one is Human biomechanics or smth like that. You can google it. Its not easy at all but its a good reference point. I mean, when I did it few years back i found that local amount of muscle mass(eg upper arm or calf) can throw off the result significantly yet there is no accurate way to measure everything precisely.

An inch (or) more around calf(or thigh) can significantly change torque at lets say front lever. No one adds 20kg ankle weights but 1 or at most 2kg to planche or front lever and it makes it a lot harder. Or it can be more like general tendency for a person to carry a lot of (muscle) mass at the certain parts of the body making some exercises more or less challenging in addition to lever lengths or proportions. Two inches doesnt look like much around calf but it is significant volume. Same thing with waist width and thigh circumference. \nPJ_GRE: Interesting.

Spend 98% of your time investing in your education and your skill set. Review your notes. Volunteer somewhere. Get a part time job even if you don't need the money. Read a book(there's hundreds of thousands of books out there, focus on self-help books, bibliographies and memoirs)\n5)Read anything that's not on your screen for God's sake!\n6)Go into your professor's office hours, become friends with your professors and staff. Especially your school's librarian.\n7)Prepare meals for the next 3 to 6 days. Step1: Make a huge batch of food balancing your protein, carbs, and veggies. Step2: Separate in portions in Ziploc or Tupperware containers and store it in your fridge or freezer. Step 3: Reheat your food in the microwave and voila. Usually the process of making all this food will take about 2-3 hours. But it will save you A LOT of time during the week that you could be spending doing homework, studying or napping. Also, you can make this into a really low budget yet healthy and delicious meals. \n8)Choose to change sleeping cycle from a monophasic to a polyphasic sleeping cycle. Trust me, there's nothing than feeling fully awake ALL DAY LONG. There's different sleeping cycles and they will help A LOT for your brain's memory capacity.\n9)Take cold showers.

There is no point in trying to push my own beliefs/interests because it's easier to follow others and those interests are enyoiable as well (why else would other people do them).\n\nI've no problem stealing (wich I did extensivly at age 10-16), but stopped doing it when I started making mroe money because I can't be bothered with it anymore (it's not going with the flow and requires effort)\n[deleted]: &gt;I'm a moral nihilist \n\nWhy?

Or did you just come to this conclusion without looking into the subject?\n\n\nanonymousMF: I admit I haven't studied filosofy much (I had one course in college, and I looked around on the internet). But from what I read about moral nihilism (some articles) I think it describes my view on the subject.\n\nI could be using it wrong so this is what I mean:\n\nThere is no objective morality because this would need some almighty 'judge' deciding what this morality is, who doesn't exist. \n\nNothing what you do really matters, we're just a small spot in the universe that will die off eventually. And even if this doesn't happen it still doesn't matter. You won't get 'punished/rewarded' for the stuff you do.\n\nWhy is the situation where there are people better then the situation where there is just dust? Why would happy people be preferable over sad people?\n[deleted]: &gt;I admit I haven't studied phsychology much\n\ndafuq?\n\n&gt;Nothing what you do really matters, we're just a small spot in the universe that will die off eventually. And even if this doesn't happen it still doesn't matter. You won't get 'punished/rewarded' for the stuff you do.\n\nThat's not the point of ethics...are you suggesting that the only reason to behave in any given way is dependent upon the outcomes of that behaviour?\n\n&gt;Why would happy people be preferable over sad people?\n\nBecause by definition \"happy\" is the word that was created to describe the state we prefer to \"sad\".\nOlathe: &gt; Because by definition \"happy\" is the word that was created to describe the state we prefer to \"sad\".\n\nI don't think the definition of \"happy\" includes anything about why the word was created. I also think you lack any evidence at all of why the word was created. I think you are just making a poor-quality circular argument: happy people are preferable over sad people because happy is preferred to sad.\n\nThis argument is easy to refute: if someone I cared about dies, I would prefer to be sad rather than to be happy. After all, happiness and sadness don't have any relative rankings in contextless preference. Instead, they are functional emotional responses to situations. You usually hope to get the one that properly corresponds to the situation, since that indicates sanity. You don't hope to get happiness over sadness in all cases.\n[deleted]: And sanity, in the big picture, makes us happy. It's still a pursuit of happy over sad, because happy is a word that was defined to describe something we like by default. \nOlathe: That's confusing, since sadness is then a requirement of sanity which leads to happiness. So in this case happiness isn't preferred to sadness, instead happiness is produced partially by past sadness.\n[deleted]: It's the exact opposite of confusing. People made up the word \"happy\" to describe a state that we like. People made up the word \"sad\" to describe a state that we do not like. Therefore happiness is de facto preferred to sadness, and even though sadness is preferred in certain contexts, it's only because it promotes happiness in a macro sense.\nOlathe: The circumstances around the creation of the words and the motives of the creators is pretty irrelevant to the conclusion, particularly because those people might have been wrong or foolish, so you'd need to show that they weren't, which would be quite an inefficient way to get to the conclusion.\n\nYou might as well just say \"We like happiness. We dislike sadness. Therefore, it's a fact that people prefer happiness to sadness\". This is, of course, circular reasoning and can't really help someone who is asking why one is preferable (circular reasoning doesn't even help us to determine that they are preferable and, more importantly, that they are preferable is not an answer to the question of why they are preferable, which was the question).\n\nThis discussion is about morals, though, not about facts. Why is it morally preferred to be happy?\n[deleted]: Because morals are about what ought to be, and since happy is a word that was made to describe something better than being sad, happy is the way things ought to be as opposed to sad.\n\n&gt;You might as well just say \"We like happiness. We dislike sadness. Therefore, it's a fact that people prefer happiness to sadness\".\n\nThat's accurate though, and while you think it's circular reasoning, it isn't. Your question is the part that makes no sense, when you ask \"why is happiness preferred?\" you might as well ask \"why is blue blue?\"\n\nYou are literally asking \"Why is the state that we find preferable the state that we find preferable?\" It's preferred because people like it better than the alternative. That's really all there is to it, there is no magical reason that happiness is better than sadness, it simply is what it is.\nOlathe: &gt; Because morals are about what ought to be, and since happy is a word that was made to describe something better than being sad, happy is the way things ought to be as opposed to sad.\n\nI think you're equivocating here. Better has two different senses: I'd like to experience that and it would be morally preferable if that happened.\n\nAs you can imagine, if what people would like to experience was equivalent to morality, morality would be quite a bit simpler to discuss. Sociopaths who violated others would not be morally abhorrent because they'd be happier and thus they ought to have done what they did.\n[deleted]: &gt;As you can imagine, if what people would like to experience was equivalent to morality, morality would be quite a bit simpler to discuss. \n\nWay to put words in my mouth. The point isn't that what people would like to experience is moral, morality is that which we ought to do. \"Happy\" is the way all creatures with preferences prefer to be. Therefore happiness is de facto better than sadness, and therefore the way we ought to behave is the way that leads to happiness.\n\n&gt;Sociopaths who violated others would not be morally abhorrent because they'd be happier and thus they ought to have done what they did.\n\nI'm going to ignore the part where you deliberately misconstrued my point to make this stupid one, and simply point out that the moral weighting of one sociopath will always be less than that of the sum total of other individuals he/she violates, thereby rendering the point stupid on your terms as well as mine.\nOlathe: I'm not sure how I was supposed to realize the details you hadn't yet specified. This is the first time you've mentioned weightings at all in this thread, for instance.\n\nIt seems pretty weird to me to say things like 'dafuq' when you haven't even come close to explaining what the person is missing. You just talk very, very, very vaguely and then complain when people don't infer all the unsaid details and proofs of what you think is true.\n[deleted]: I'm sorry, I should've specified that \"many\" weighs more than \"few\"?\n\nYou're still an idiot 23 days later.\nOlathe: Usually when people discuss the fundamentals of ethics with any skill, they define their terms with quite a bit more detail than you apparently did. I was assuming that you had taken the effort to specify things at least to the level that it didn't leave out major components, like that your ethical system is based on some kind of calculus.\n\nAs you seem to be unaware, there are systems of ethics in which weightings don't play a role at all. You didn't mention that yours had weightings at all.

{"full_text": "darthbarracuda: Susan Haack - Scientism and its Discontents\n\nthe_real_trebitsch: It was a rather interesting read.\n\nHowever, the article brings together under the blanket term \"scientism\" a number of different phenomena:\n\n1) A certain (meta)philosophical view;\n2) A certain stratagem used by con-men or politicians;\n3) The phenomenon that sometimes scientists do philosophy _sans le savoir_;\n4) A certain attitude towards the \"humanities\".\n\nObviously, these are not the same. Indeed, they can be maintained or denied independently of each other. And I think it is misleading to talk about these phenomena as varieties or kinds or manifestations or whatever of scientism. To me, kinds of scientism means something like kinds of the metaphilosophical view, or kinds of the attitude towards the humanities, etc.\n\n\nNow, I'm only interested in scientism about philosophy (or (1)).\n\nThe author seems to belong to the subset of philosophers we might call \"the guardians of the manifest image\". This kind of philosopher thinks that philosophy is something conservative: its aim is to shield the manifest image, namely, folk psychology, societal and political institutions and the special sciences, from any disruption potentially caused by the progress of science. \nOn the other side there are the \"disruptive\" or \"revisionary\" philosophers who, drawing on the newest scientific results, criticize the manifest image and the institutions that depend on it. \nHaack is quite dismissive towards Rosenberg's _Guide_, which is an exercise in the \"disruptive\" kind of philosophy (it can be said to be \"crude\", but I'm not interested in this aspect at the moment). She sounds as though it were enough just to showcase Rosenberg's ideas to show how absurd such philosophy is. But in fact Rosenberg's ideas are far from extraordinary. Only the \"guardians\" find authors like Rosenberg absurd or even more-than-moderately interesting. For quite a lot of people, what Rosenberg says is just common sense.\n\n&gt;Philosophy is about the world, and so requires experience; not, however, the recherch\u00e9 experience needed by the sciences, but the familiar, everyday experience of our interactions with the world and with others.\n\nThe doctrine of one version of Scientism is that all knowledge is either scientific or everyday knowledge. (The only knowledge that is taken by some to exist but it doesn't, by the lights of this kind of Scientism, is philosophical knowledge.) \n\nHaack seems to try to defend philosophy against Scientism by consigning it to the \"everyday\", conceding the truth of (a kind of) Scientism. This is an interesting proposal, but of course very controversial. There are, for example, those who think that currently philosophy is in a crisis or in decline precisely because of the retreat from contact with the sciences and the obsession with the \"everyday\". \n\n&gt;What we see is not sustained, serious efforts to make philosophical inquiry as fruitful ... as the best scientific inquiry... and not solid and industrious investigation of philosophical questions, but bold promises that this or that result from the sciences will do the job ...or even this or that entire field of philosophy, ... must be misconceived, and should simply be abandoned. \n\nThe abandonment of fields of philosophy can be entirely warranted. It would make no sense to keep alive \"fields\" because of some compulsive belief that things must be \"industriously investigated\" instead of abandoning them.\n\nFor example, the philosophers of today are no longer interested in whether divine providence contradicts free will or whether angels have the power of imagination, because religion is no longer a dominant factor in the social environment of philosophy. \n\n&gt;All scientific work rests on these presuppositions; but the special sciences can neither explain nor justify them\u2014that task falls to philosophy.\n\nThis desideratum is compatible with the idea of some very minimal philosophy, permitted even by anti-philosophy scientism. Most scientists have some such kind of minimal philosophy; they don't need professional philosophers to make one for them.\n\nSo it is true that _philosophy_ has some tasks which might be even said to be logically prior to any science. However, these tasks can be easily handled without any serious input from academic philosophy.\nuncannywally: &gt; The author seems to belong to the subset of philosophers we might call \"the guardians of the manifest image\".\n\nWho's \"we\"? Did you just lift this otherwise obscure phrase from Zawidzki's book on Dennett? That's the only place I can find it. \n\n&gt; this kind of philosopher thinks that philosophy is something conservative ... its aim is to shield the manifest image, namely, folk psychology, societal and political institutions and the special sciences, from any disruption potentially caused by the progress of science\n\nThis is uncharitably reductive in the extreme. While Haack does indeed seek here to (justly) defend folk psychology from total scientistic erasure, it's an absurd leap to claim that she, or any other opponent of scientism, therefore sees all philosophy as somehow primarily engaged in the conservation of anti-scientific ideas. Also, as an aside, your use of the term \"disruption\" here feels almost borrowed from a silicon valley startup pitch, freighted with the same nebulous connotations of great utopic upheavals, without actually specifying much at all in the way of concrete detail.\n\n&gt; This desideratum is compatible with the idea of some very minimal philosophy, permitted even by anti-philosophy scientism. Most scientists have some such kind of minimal philosophy; they don't need professional philosophers to make one for them.\n\nAh of course. The possibility for knowledge attained outside the methodology of science does exist, you graciously concede, but such knowledge is so very minimal in scope as to be immediately obvious to anyone. Thus professional philosophy is rendered totally useless. Such a minimal base philosophy is apparently so obvious that you have decided that it's not worth outlining in even the vaguest of terms. Clearly all the questions of the everyday, of the phenomenal, of the moral, of the social, etc. are all either answered 100% satisfactorily by the hard sciences, or they're answered by anyone who has a spare 15 minutes between doing lab experiments to reflect on them.\nthe_real_trebitsch: &gt;Did you just lift this otherwise obscure phrase from Zawidzki's book on Dennett?\n\nI haven't heard of Zawidzki (until now), thank you for the tip!\n\n&gt;Clearly all the questions of the everyday, of the phenomenal, of the moral, of the social, etc. are all either answered 100% satisfactorily by the hard sciences\n\nNo. They are answered, and not necessarily \"100% satisfactorily\" (whatever that means), by the hard sciences _and_ \"everyday knowledge\" (varieties of \"common sense\" and other non-departmental, non-academic, folk kind of knowledge) _and_ non-hard sciences (like psychology, sociology etc.) _and_ arts _and_ possibly some philosophy. According to Scientism, of which I am no adherent, the contribution of philosophy is minimal, probably so much so that no academic philosophy is needed at all.\n\n\nBTW, does academic philosophy _answer 100% satisfactorily_ the \"questions of the everyday, of the phenomenal, of the moral\" etc.? \n", "prompt": "darthbarracuda: Susan Haack - Scientism and its Discontents\n\nthe_real_trebitsch: It was a rather interesting read.\n\nHowever, the article brings together under the blanket term \"scientism\" a number of different phenomena:\n\n1) A certain (meta)philosophical view", "orig": ";\n2) A certain stratagem used by con-men or politicians;\n3) The phenomenon that sometimes scientists do philosophy _sans le savoir_;\n4) A certain attitude towards the \"humanities\".\n\nObviously, these are not the same.

{"full_text": "robdidlyob: Need help from an electrician (x-post from r/fixit)\nOk, I need some electrical help. My house was built in 1953, and has an addition that was built sometime in the 1990s. Where the power meets the house, there's a large breaker box with the meter on one side, and a row of breakers on the other. One is the main breaker, one goes to the a/c unit outside, one goes around the house to the addition (which has its own breaker panel inside), one goes inside the house to a screw-in type fuse panel, and one breaker goes to an opening in the wall near the panel and is apparently connected to the outlets &amp; lights I am having a problem with.\n\nFor the past few months we've had low voltage (like 83v) at these affected outlets and lights, and I've been opening every switch, outlet, and ceiling light looking for loose or broken wires. I didn't find any, but anywhere I found wires crimped together, I cut the crimp off, stripped the wires and twisted and capped them. This didn't help the low voltage problem. I replaced every switch and outlet that was affected -- no change. I tested every circuit in the fuse panel inside the house, and there were I believe 2 circuits in the house that were affected with the low voltage. I even took as much of it apart as I could and cleaned all the contacts with sandpaper -- no change. I even opened up that other small box outside where it goes into the wall. There were wires twisted together but it looked kinda ratty so I unhooked it all, cleaned everything, and retwisted them and capped them. I am 100% sure I did not reverse the pairs of wires. All the other outlets work fine and have full power. This one breaker (120v 20A) outside seemed to be the culprit so I replaced it and everything seemed to be working great again, until tonight.\n\nApparently the GFI outlet in the bathroom quit working right and was putting a load on the circuit (broken test button), and using the cooktop was tripping that breaker, so I took the outlet out and replaced it with a regular non-GFI outlet (yeah I know, but we don't use this bathroom for anything at all, I'm not worried about it not being GFI for the time being). That fixed that problem, but now I have an even bigger problem. I have no idea how this came to be.\n\nWhen that breaker is turned ON, the outlets &amp; lights that are connected to it don't work at all (no voltage at all), but everything else in the house is fine. When the breaker is OFF, the power co. meter turns off also, and everything I was previously having a problem with works fine (107-109v at the outlets), BUT then my cooktop/fridge/other stuff doesn't work at all. It doesn't make any sense at all. I checked the fuse panel in the house and there's no blown fuses or loose wires or anything.\n\nIs it possible that the wires in that box going into the wall are backwards? I only uncapped one pair at a time specifically so I wouldn't mix them up. What would happen if I reversed them?\n\nHere's a drawing of the house and the affected outlets and stuff:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/2a18w.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2a18w.jpg )\n\nthe green marks are good working lights and outlets, and the red ones are of course the bad ones that aren't working at all at the moment\n\nI can take pictures if it'd help at all.\n\nupdate 1 -- seems that the breaker quit working altogether. Tried measuring voltage across it both on and off and nada.\n\n------------------------------\nFINAL UPDATE -- Duke Power came out and I explained the problem to the guy. He tested the incoming power at the main breaker, and determined that the problem was definitely on their side. He got up in his bucket and checked out the connections, and found out that the problem was a bad transformer and crimps that had been severely damaged by squirrels. [He replaced the entire transformer and put new wires and crimps on](http://i.imgur.com/DfDBR.jpg), and everything works great now. No dim lights or low voltages anywhere anymore.  Thanks everyone for their help and suggestions!\n\n[deleted]: Hold on.\n\nWhen you say...\n\n&gt;When that breaker is turned ON, the electrical meter turns off, the \n&gt; outlets &amp; lights that are connected to it don't work at all (no voltage\n&gt; at all), but everything else in the house is fine\n\nWhat electric meter are you talking about?  The one that belongs to the power company and measures your usage?   How can that not work but the rest of your house be fine?\nrobdidlyob: The digital meter on the side of the house that belongs to the power company, when I turn the one breaker ON, the meter goes blank, yet everything in the house is still on.\nrobdidlyob: Ok oops, I was wrong. When the breaker is on the meter is on. When the breaker is OFF, the meter turns off as well, but everything connected to the breaker turns on, and a lot of stuff not directly connected to it (outlets and lights that previously worked fine), turns off.\nguysmiley00: I'm not an expert, but you may want to call the power company out to have a look. There shouldn't be *any* power coming through if the meter's turned off, and the fact that there is is very disturbing. Is there any possibility that your house may have had a grow-op or something in the past? Those will often tap power before the meter, both to save money (might as well steal electricity while growing weed, right?) and to avoid detection via increased power usage. If that's the case, you can bet that the work probably isn't what you'd call \"top-notch\", and could be hazardous, as well as possibly voiding your insurance.\n\nIf the place *was* a grow-op, you'd probably want to know, because they tend to have all sorts of other issues as well. Structure compromised, mold everywhere - it can be a very bad scene. Better to know before something fails catastrophically.\nrobdidlyob: LOL no it wasn't a grow op. Everything at the meter looks professional and legit. Like I said, everything has been fine up til recently. \nguysmiley00: Well, that's a relief, anyway.

Shouldn't that be all we need to know to stop systematically bleeding it into our PUBLIC DRINKING WATER?\n\nDuh.\nwaldowv: Bullshit.  Calling the levels \"similar\" is a lie.  EPA recommends (and Portland proposed) 0.7mg/L, which is less than the \"control\" in most of these studies.\n\nThe takeaway is that everything can be poisonous and toxic in high enough levels.  Recommended intake of water for women is 2.2 l/day, but drinking 6 can kill you.\n[deleted]: Tell me - how does the government control how much fluoride is ingested by each and every person?\n\nTell me that.\nwaldowv: Do I need to explain what the word \"concentration\" means?  You take 100,000 liters of water and put in 70 grams of fluoride.  Don't put in 7000.  Don't put in 700,000.  Use a scale if you're doing it by hand.  Or, better yet, set up a foolproof automatic dispenser.  \n\n100,000 liters of water is the size of an average swimming pool.  70 grams is about how much fits in a salt shaker.\n\nSince fluoride's time in the blood is short, it is simply not possible to get a 10x dose.\n\n[deleted]: I didn't ask how they control the concentration of fluoride in the water, i asked how they control the dosages of fluoride in each and every person's BODY.\n\nDoes each person drink a different amount of water, and therefore receive differing amounts of fluoride on a daily basis?\n\nwaldowv: Yes, different people will ingest and *immediately excrete/remove from the blood* slightly different microgram totals of fluoride.  Since it is excreted so quickly, the total intake is essentially irrelevant.  Since you won't believe me/science, don't you wonder why all the studies in Table 1 are listed by concentration?\n\nTo put it another way, I'm in my 30s and have drunk hundreds of gallons of liquor in my lifetime.

I don't think you will disagree that, perhaps, we don't know all there is to know about the long-term, or really life-term, effects of fluoridation. This is why he is asking about the concentrations in the individual body, because little is said about the accumulation over such a long time. There are some of us that don't really want to find out the hard way, years down the road. When there are other options, can you really blame people who see it as unethical for wanting to opt out?\nwaldowv: That's reaching at straws.  For one thing, studies go back to 1900 and, I believe, it was in 1946 that municipalities actually started adding it in earnest because of the prior studies.  Regardless, there is no disease that I can think of that has *perfectly statistically silent* incubation of over 60 years.  By 60, something like 13% of Americans will already be dead which, in the case of fluoride, means that the data set has tens of millions of people in it, none of whose deaths can be attributed to properly fluorinated municipal water.  How many statistics are enough for you?\n\nOr are you against fluoridation for some other reason, and just reaching at straws?\nladycharles: Okay well we just aren't going to agree on this. I disagree with fluoride for a multitude of reasons but the main one is: I have not given anyone the authority to medicate me. For this very basic reason I am against it. \nwaldowv: I believe the term \"medicine\" in this context does not apply to fluoride.  Most \"medicines\" we encounter today have downsides, side effects, and dangers.  They are taken by small groups effected by things like acid reflux as a calculated risk, weighed against things like drymouth. Fluoride in the concentrations used in municipal water supplies has no side effects.  None.  I'm not saying that to be rhetorical/bombastic, I'm saying that because it is scientific fact.  I support fluoridation.  I do not support the addition of things like ibuprofen or antibiotics--drugs with known side effects and downsides.  Fluoride is different. \nladycharles: I'm not going to debate you on your feelings. This has already been defined by the FDA. Please see How Does The Law Define a Drug? http://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/ucm074201.htm\nwaldowv: I'm not saying it's not a medicine in the technical sense, I'm saying the anti-'s use that word because it creates connotations for laypeople that are external to the technical meaning and illicit an emotional response that works to their advantage.  I'm saying from a *moral* perspective, it is not a medicine in the same way that Viagra and Lipitor are.\nladycharles: If it's by definition a medicine, I'm not going to treat it as anything but that, regardless of the implied connotations you've created to use against me. (The anti-s?!) I'm commenting on a thread about fluoride where people such as yourself are debating the science and ethics of the practice &amp; now I'm accused of abusing the term 'medication' as if I'm sensationalizing it by using its actual classification. I agree that its not kin to putting viagra &amp; lipitor in the public water, but mainly because that is absolutey bananas and not in any way shape or form comparable to fluoride. \nwaldowv: Ok, well how about this: suppose there's a chemical compound that makes children under the age of 12 bulletproof.  Every mass shooting from on out will have zero children injured.  No side effects at all.  Only catch is, everyone has to take it.  It's medicine all right.

{"full_text": "Wobulating: CMV: Communism is a fundamentally unworkable economic system\nTo start with, I am defining communism as an economic system where all property is publicly owned, and resources are given to citizens to fulfill their needs, as described by Marx.\n\nThis system, however, has a number of fundamental flaws that are inherent to it and cannot be escaped.\n\nIts largest problem, by far, is that it stifles innovation and growth. If your rewards are guaranteed, and are guaranteed to be equal, then there's very little motivation to work harder and innovate more, because there's no personal reward from it.\n\nTo provide an example, I'll use chickens and eggs. If you're a farmer with a chicken coop and you make enough eggs(let's say 100 a month as a totally arbitrary number) to fulfill your quotas, off of 20 hours a week of work. You *could* raise more chickens, maybe bump it up to 200 eggs, but why would you? You would need to build a bigger coop, spend more time caring for them, shovel more waste out and more food in, and it's just generally a lot more work. Maybe if you did double the number of chickens, you'd be fed up and you'd try to make an automatic chicken feeder, so it took less time for you, and maybe you'd even bump it up to 300 eggs with this new-fangled chicken feeder, but if you're on 100 eggs, there's just not much pressure. The entire point of communism is that whether you get 100 or 300 eggs, you are still rewarded about the same, so why put in the extra effort?\n\nThere are, of course, proposed solutions, often quotas- but those have a very poor track record, for the simple reason that setting quotas is *really hard*. Set them too high, and your citizens can't reach them and they hate you, and set them too low, and just don't get very much stuff done, and figuring out how much is too high or too low is really, really difficult. There's a million factors that go into determining the maximum amount that a person can reasonably produce, and such a top-heavy approach simply cannot account for them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo step higher up, planned economies like this(and communism does demand a planned economy) have *really* bad track records. Markets and environments change dramatically and quickly, and it's very hard for top-heavy economies to respond well to those sorts of changing circumstances. It's very hard for people to respond to change, generally, especially if there's no personal stake. If the central planner goes home at the end of the day no matter what, then they probably aren't gonna get super invested in whether or not all the stuff that they're responsible for is performing optimally. \n\nAdditionally, they're simply much worse at creating that innovation that drives the world forward- as outlined, they decrease personal desire to innovate, but even for the people who *do* want to make something new, it's much more difficult. Creating something new and exciting is, at the end of the day, going to take resources and time, and if you have to petition a bureaucrat a hundred miles away to let you do this, that's a huge barrier to entry.\nPreacherJudge: &gt; Its largest problem, by far, is that it stifles innovation and growth. If your rewards are guaranteed, and are guaranteed to be equal, then there's very little motivation to work harder and innovate more, because there's no personal reward from it.\n\nPeople innovate and work hard all the time without getting lots of money from it.  This is just knee-jerk cynicism, assuming that the only thing that'll motivate people is personal, financial gain.\ncape_of_good_hope: I just assume that anyone who has that argument has never been deeply involved in fandom. The lengths that people will go to create things for free for the media they love is limitless.\npearoad: Passion alone does not drive human society.\n\nThere are thousands upon thousands of people who are passionate about star wars for example, but less people will be passionate about, say, trains.\n\nEven though trains are a vital part of modern human transport, one of the most economically efficient and depending on the distance, fast enough to compete with trucking or flying the goods; just because they don't zip around in space shooting lasers people will be less interested in them.\n\nImagine a world where your train systems are failing and yet there are 70 different star wars fan films coming out each year. Let me emphasize my point. Passion alone does not drive human society.\n\nIn fact, I'd argue the stuff that the lesser people are passionate about are the real deal. Train is a relatively easier example, and there are more messy things that are vital for the human society. Say, garbage disposal system. Say, sewers system literally handling people's s\\*\\*t.\n\nThe current world works because you pay people do to stuff they don't want to do. If they don't want to do it, pay them more and see if they will do it!\n\nI know this is glorifying capitalism, and that it doesn't always work this way - some greedy ass will try to steal the valuable hard work somewhere along the line, by not paying enough etc., but this is how capitalism works in essence.\n\nWhereas communism has no real way of compensating people for doing something that everybody don't want to do.\n\nI will put it simple : If you can get enough people to be passionate about shoveling literal s\\*\\*t without any tangible compensation, that's when I will consider communism.\nThe_Last_Minority: If you think people aren't passionate about infrastructure, and ESPECIALLY trains, then I suggest googling forums and social media groups about them. I know people who can declaim passionately on the different models of high-speed engine rolled out in Japan or Europe, and who send pictures when they see an unusual model in the station. If rail and infrastructure education and development was opened, you wouldn't be able to keep people away.\n\nAlso, from where comes the idea that nobody cares about sanitation? Obviously it isn't the most appealing job, but there are still people who like doing it. Besides, it needs to happen and people recognize that. Under community control, a number of models exist. One would be rotating, where multiple people put in a bit of time, and another could be some form of community incentive, where the people who help clean the most get a shout-out or their name on a plaque each month. Not all incentive has to be financial. \n\nBest model, imo, is a combination of rotating responsibility and restructuring how we handle waste. Currently Americans are highly inefficient with waste disposal, something that makes the job of waste collection much less pleasant. Look at Japan for a good counter-example. If everyone knows they or someone they know will take a turn doing community service, there is kore incentive to keep waste to a minimum and not make it gross.\n\nCommunism doesn't mean everything will suddenly be perfect. However, removing profit motive and the stigma around certain jobs absolutely means fewer people will take issue with it.\npearoad: Dude, my point is, its not that NOBODY cares, its that not ENOUGH people will be interested in a lot of the jobs without the monetary compensation that enables them to do other things.\n\nAnd community incentives? This is honestly such a naive thought. Do you really think enough people will naturally be inclined to shovel your s\\*\\*t because you tell nice things to them?\n\nLet me tell you what, if i gave you enough compliments and some plaque on a wall a month, would YOU be willing to shovel my s\\*\\*t? You can't just randomly imagine that there must be \"some other guy\" who's willing to do this.\n\nI am sorry, but I'd rather have a single piece of tangible bread(and more) for my family than some compliment if i had to work those jobs.\n\nCapitalism is a system that relies on the \"perceived value\" of things, including labor and goods. Even animals - insects! engage in trade! I am baffled as to how people are failing to grasp this.\n\nIt isn't capitalism stopping you from chasing your passion, it is just the real world stopping you from doing it. The fact is, the real world doesn't have enough of these \"good passion jobs\", where grueling manufacturing jobs \"where you have to repeat the same mundane thing for the next 12 hours jobs\" are in abundance.\n\nAnd don't get me started \"we must go back to simpler way of life with less wastes\" bs. Just so you know, economy of scale is a very real thing. We as a society benefit more as a whole by having a centralized system of sorts.\n\nIf you are in denial, please, let me know if you can singlehandedly build the smartphone or the pc from ground up, whatever it is that you are using to browse internet rn. It just doesn't happen.\n\nCapitalism sucks, I agree.\n\nBut its simply the only way things work. Can we work on it so that people are actually treated more fairly, with appropriate wages? Hell yeah, we should!\n\nBut communism never works. So many countries tried, So many countries failed. Its funny how they always say \"oh, all the countries that failed didn't practice &lt;true communism&gt;.\"\n\nwhatever the f\\*\\*k that means. I honestly think this is because the baseline philosophy is flawed, which is why it always directs itself towards dictatorship and overly controlling governments with only the few elites enjoying the fruit.\n\nOh, the irony.\nEyesofmalice: If you go country by country,capitalism has failed way more times that communism has. Besides, a good incentive for working in sanitation would be benefits such as extended vacations, earlier retirement and so on.  \n\nBesides, in a capitalist economy infrastructure jobs can only get access to more advanced technology for fulfilling a task if the market deems it profitable. In a communist economy we'd probably task engineers and scientists to work on optimizing waste disposal and infrastructure in order to make them sustainable and efficient. I mean that's a current environmental concern that can't be addressed because the market is just not willing to invest that much in it. With communal central control the people who point at those problems would have the backing of the state and the resources to find solutions for them.\npearoad: Proportionally, all the countries that has proclaimed communism has 1. Either failed, 2. Is failing, 3. Or is only pretending to be a communist to protect a dictatorship regime, e.g. China.\n\nThere were hundreds, there\u2019s what, Cuba left?\n\nAll the other thrieving countries are worked on by capitalism. Yeah it failed a lot of countries, but so far it has been the only known way that has the potential to work.\n\nYour second paragraph is exactly why communism fails so hard and is especially prone to a fascist government. Seriously, look at it.\n\nGovernment will tell you exactly what you do, decide exactly what you do even if the market doesn\u2019t accomodate it. Sounds familiar? Its literally just one step away!\n\nI am all for worker\u2019s benefits and universal government programs supporting basic human needs, but damn, the reality is, it works in capitalism better than communism ever has.\nEyesofmalice: You thinking that successful communist countries are only pretending to be so while being capitalists instead is just allowing your capitalist paranoia to run off. \n\nBeing one step away means very little when as many fascist governments have been capitalistic. Fascism has risen in various economic systems. So it's again judging communism for stuff that also has happened and continues to happen under capitalism.\npearoad: You can\u2019t seriously believe China is a successful communist country. Successful? Yes. Communist? No.\n\nDude, have you seen how their workers live? Its literally one of the worst ways capitalism manifested itself.\n\nThey\u2019ve only just ruled LAST MONTH that 996 (9am to 9pm, six days a week) work culture to be illegal! That is 72 hours a week! Most successful capitalistic countries work 40 hours a week.\nEyesofmalice: Successful capitalistic countries are allowed that luxury by working others in other countries to death. You have to be cynical to think that your first world goods aren't being produced by children in less developed countries.\n\nBesides the Chinese government owns most of the land in china and only loans it if it's going to be used for productive purposes,which to me sounds like the state owns a crucial mean of producing land. They also have country wide welfare housing and services, and they routinely seize industries as well as regular them tightly. I'd love to hear what is it about china that is capitalistic in your eyes. \n\nBesides your point is so convoluted. So china is not communistic because their workers rights are non existent. So are you implying that capitalism demands workers exploitation?\n\nAdditionally, it's not uncommon in capitalist countries for people to need to work two jobs in order to make ends meet.and I'm not even talking about proletarians but also members of the middle class.\npearoad: Yes, China's workers' rights are non existent. Meanwhile capitalistic countries exercise workers' rights and have, like I mentioned, enjoys 40 hour weeks. Do you seriously not see the irony here?\n\nCombined with much higher minimum wage, workers in successful capitalist countries in effect, live much more humane life. So like i said, workers' rights seems to be much more well protected in capitalistic countries.\n\nThe very core of communism is being done better by capitalism!\n\nDo you seriously not see how flawed the whole idea is?\n\nAlso, Chinese government owns most of the land, yes. But their welfare housing is a joke. Look up \"Beijing underground apartments\", and maybe you should check out how their proletariats live. It never ceases to amaze me how they haven't revolted yet.\n\nPlus, although they own the land, because they are loaned off to private companies, the means of production STILL belongs in the private sector. How is that communism, when the fruits of production goes straight to the hands of the bourgeoisie?\n\nSo basically denying their very core principles of the communism by non existent workers' rights, while not even providing the necessary housing, while giving all the fruits to the bourgeoisie?\n\nTrust me, you'd rather want to believe China is a capitalist country, if you seriously  love communism. Either way, I honestly don't care though, since China only shows how dystopian capitalistic societies can be.\n\nSo claim China communists all you want, I guess.\nEyesofmalice: So if chine is so capitalistic and terrible, wouldn't that prove that capitalistic tendencies tend to oversee human rights? \n\n\nAnd again,  capitalist countries rely on exploiting foreign workers, so you can't just analyze the workers right on one piece of land without taking into account the conditions created overseas for those \"workers privileges\". \n\n\nBesides, almost no capitalist country has been so without brutal exploitation of other territories. So it's in very bad faith to say that the success of these supposed capitalistic paradises doesn't come at the cost of the inhumane exploitation of foreign workers.\n\nIt isn't communism, it's socialism, they're getting there though. At least the state can rent the private sector plus tax them.  \n\nAlso, underground apartments are way mor humane than the roaring levels of homelessness we have in capitalistic countries. We have to analyze china in context, and in context china is doing better than about 80% of all capitalistic countries.\n\nYou're taking the best examples of capitalism while avoiding any of their colonialist tendencies and also brushing under the rug all capitalistic countries which have incredibly high levels of corruption, homelessness, starvation and. Unemployment. Metrics that, under the rule of the Chinese communist party decreased dramatically. \n\nBut fine, since you have such a hate boner against china and since it's also making your point so convoluted, take Cuba then. They have a better standard of living than most of south America , even with the embargo in action, they report higher quality of education and also lower levels of malnutrition and homelessness than other latina merca countries which are routinely torn and exploited by america and Europe for the benefit of enterprises.\npearoad: Omg, let me try to sum it up:\n\n1. Either china is capitalist and sucks in workers rights, or is a \u201csuccessful\u201d communist and sucks in workers right.\n\n2-1. There are other capitalist countries who have it a lot better than chinese protariats - and like i noted, it seems like protariats do better in capitalist countries than in communism.\n\n2-2. This is the core value of communism, and if this is done better by capitalist, you seriously have to wonder if the idealogy is actually legit\n\n3. I brought up china in a passing by note saying how i think China is more capitalistic, and it was you who wanted to expand more into that realm.\n\n4-1. Nobody forced these less developed countries to do, what you\u2019d call, \u201cslave labor\u201d or \u201ccapitalistic colonialism\u201d. They can always refuse, do whatever the hell they want. This the very nature of capitalism - people are free to choose what they do.\n\n4-2. However, everyone wants foreign investment and always welcomes them with open arms, including China. This is because, in a lot of scenarios, it is a win-win situation. Economics isn\u2019t a zero-sum game.\n\n5. Maybe you should stop calling people convoluted, when it is definitely you who likes to bring in multiple points at the same time, hence me needing to be this bulletin point form.\n\n6. The forementioned issues of China was introduced as a result of CCP rule to begin with. Corruption and starvation especially. This was solved by, ironically, introducing more capitalistic values.\n\n7. China isn\u2019t doing better than 80% of all capitalistic countries. They rank 85 at HDI, 2019. This is barely above 55%. Below are mostly african countries, which ironically, a lot of them former communist nations.\n\nDude honestly i don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019ve spent way too much time forming up these arguements and i am not willing to spend more time.\n\nSo goodbye\nEyesofmalice: 2.1 again, China only sucks at workers rights in comparison to certain countries which still force other people in other countries to work till they drop or starve to death jobless.\n\n2.2 downright refuse your claim that workers rights are better under capitalist countries. We have insanely high rates of unemployment, unsormountable student debt, economic crises every seven or eight years, mass layoff regularly. Even in my country, the average person has less access to food and services than people in Cuba,even though our territory has more natural resources than Cuba, but obviously they're all owned by foreign enterprises that have funded armed groups and seized ownership of our resources.\n\n3. That increase in life quality by other capitalist countries didn't come out of nowhere, it was caused by rampant colonialism.\n\n4. You can either work for pennies or we'll bomb you. You're free to choose. Such great freedom. It's just such bullshit claim tbh. It's like, look at cuba.are you also gonna say that no one is forcing Cuba to turn into a capitalist state? Or Afghanistan? Or Syria? Even Colombia, my own country. It's so suspicious that it seems that enterprises from Europe and the states are always involved in the funding of armed groups and policy change.\n\n4.1\" everyone wants foreign investment\" it's too broad of a description, everyone wants a specific type of foreign investment, not the type that sucks the resources out of your country and then leaves useless infrastructure in place.\n\n5. I said your point was convoluted, not you. You're not your points. You thinking that your self is your arguments is kinda... Weird I guess.\n\n6. Hdi is super contested though. My own country ranks higher than china and yet chine has lower rates of child mortality, higher quality of education, higher index of industrial development and production. So I'd very very wary to put as much weight as you seem to on that index tbh.\npearoad: Ok. I think our differences lie on personal experience afterall.\n\nFor context, I am S. Korean and I've seen what capitalism can achieve. After the Korean war, for my grandparents it was luxurious to have meat on table at all. Today, a spoilt brat of me will not have a table without meat.\n\nMeanwhile, N. Korea, with the very same culture and history, are still starving to this day with a strong fascist of a government - or even an authoritarian monarchy.\n\nThe difference is so big, that even with having the same genetics, their average height is at least 20cm (or more) lower than S. Korea's. Meanwhile, the average male height of S. Korea in 20s stand around 175cm, tallest of any Asian nation and on par with European &amp; N. American nations. This is only after 3 generations of capitalism.\n\nI've myself seen first hand, how my hometown became so developed from a s\\*\\*tty rural town to what we have today. They were selling dog meat on the market, it was their thing up until 20 years ago. My whole block wasn't here 20 years ago, and 2 whole cities immediately next to us. (there are building 2 more as we speak).\n\nOur companies such as Samsung, LG have global presence and we don't bomb people when they don't want us. We don't care, we will find another bunch who'd welcome us.\n\nCuba's case sucks for them and yeah I'd love to see the sanctions to be lifted too, for humanitarian reasons, but history tells us that it was the Cubans who forcifully annexed US citizen owned property there during the communist revolution, so I also understand why US is so pissy about this.\n\nMeanwhile, My dad owned a business in China. He sold it, but this is why I understand how things are in CN. I've been there multiple times, and seen how people live, firsthand.\n\nI've had coworkers who are ethnic Korean Chinese, giving me explicit detail about how things are so different. We have so much of our own problems. young people aren't getting married anymore, not having kids, aging population etc., but they'd rather come and live here instead. They also face hideous discrimination, but since our government legally proclaims them to be our citizen, they CAN come here and they DO.\n\nBare in mind, this is a nation that started from ashes, we were poorer than most african nations in 1950s, let alone China or North Korea.\n\nI don't deny that capitalism CAN suck too. In fact, I'd argue that It DOES suck. But at least for ME, I've seen how much communism sucks so much MORE.\n\nMaybe for you, your experiences might be different and it might shape you differently. But that is MY experience. I think we just have to agree to disagree, seriously, because we are going nowhere with this discussion.\n\nHave a good day.\nalhanathalas: North Korea is not a communist nation, there is no state in communism. Your country has had extensive funding from the west. I'm from Turkey and i can tell you a very different story.\npearoad: lol ofc NK isn\u2019t communist. To the \u201cfundamentalism communists\u201d apparently there was no \u201ctrue\u201d communist state. Maybe because it isn\u2019t possible at all to have a \u201ctrue communist state\u201d.\n\nAnd no, communists are allowed to have a state, in fact, communism is defined as \u201cstate owning the means of production\u201d. What you are describing is anarcho-communism, which is a vastly different concept.\n\nYes SK was funded massively by the West, but so was many other countries. Did all of them succeed? No, very few succeeded, if at all but KR. \n\nDoes this mean capitalism isn\u2019t as good as people preach? Yes, absolutely. But let me repeat, communism has NEVER EVER worked as good as capitalistic states have. This is a given fact with no disputes.\n\nJust please don\u2019t necro a dead thread again.\n\nI am done talking about this.\nalhanathalas: you don't know ANYTHING about socialism and communism i'm not blaming you for wanting to shut up. better stay that way lumpen cunt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withering\\_away\\_of\\_the\\_state\npearoad: You don\u2019t even know the difference between anarcho communism and just communism, and have the audacity to say it is \u201cI\u201d who doesn\u2019t know anything.\n\nWow. You deserve some slow claps.\nalhanathalas: lmao literally unaware of what he is talking about. go read some theory, you are wrong.\npearoad: Marx was obviously wrong about \u201cwithering away of the state\u201d, most communist states ended up with extreme authority governing over the people.\n\nChina, NK, Soviet Union for example. Or they literally \u201cwithered away\u201d and no longer exist.\n\nMarx\u2019s idealistic theory is literally some 150 years ago. People were fighting on horseback, black/women\u2019s rights were long way to come, religious states were still a thing.\n\nTurkey was under the Ottomans rule! How do you not see how obsolete the idea is? People tried and failed, its as simple as that.\nalhanathalas: &gt;Marx was obviously wrong about \u201cwithering away of the state\u201d, most communist states ended up with extreme authority governing over the people.\n\nMarx? Who said anything about Marx? Stop making a joke of yourself already. This is emberassing really, repeating your anti-communist school curriculum bulllcrap.\n\n&gt;China, NK, Soviet Union for example. Or they literally \u201cwithered away\u201d and no longer exist.\r\n\nBecause they are not COMMUNIST COUNTRIES. THEY ARE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE BASICS OF POLITICAL THEORIES OF COMMUNISM YET YOU DARE TO TALK ABOUT IT. \n\n&gt;Marx\u2019s idealistic theory is literally some 150 years ago. People were fighting on horseback, black/women\u2019s rights were long way to come, religious states were still a thing.\r  \n\r\n\nThe fuck is an idealistic theory? The fuck are you even talking about? 150 years? Black rights? What the fuck are you even talking about, you think there were black people in Germany in 1800s? XD. Holy shit i've heard a lot of criticism about communism but it being \"old\" is new. You know... Capitalism and Free markets are older than Marx right? You also know Communism is not theorized by Marx and it's been around some time before Marx? Like, the fuck are you talking about? How old are you? You cannot be older than 18 or something, your mind seems to be filled up with trash. Free it up. I'm not even going to start talking about religious states. You clearly haven't read Das Kapital. \n\n&gt;Turkey was under the Ottomans rule! How do you not see how obsolete the idea is? People tried and failed, its as simple as that.\r  \n\r\n\nTurkey was not under Ottoman's rule. Turkish Republic didn't exist before 1923. Obsolete idea? Ottomans are an obsolote idea? Sure. Your country is in shambles, you have no young, you have BY FAR the lowest fertility rate in the world. It's going down because your Captalist system created such a malicious enviroment for children and adults people don't want to have children anymore. You are fucked and capitalism is the reason.\npearoad: lol, here we go again. Ofc they weren't communists, why else would have failed? /s. Socialistic states are countries closer to Scandinavian countries, which is proven to WORK. Communism NEVER has in large scale.\n\nChina for example, as it is moving away from communism into socialist (which is why it grew so much in  the first place), but for example they still have laws based off communistic laws, the government owns the land and corporate leases them for example.\n\nYeah, capitalism is some old idea, but it is being worked on and new ideas are being built on top of it. Like the theory of evolution isn't new, but like how the modern version of it is vastly different than what Darwin originally suggested.\n\nOn capitalism, people research through different economic blocks, and are constantly trying to learn something new(because frankly, it makes money!).\n\nCan you say the same about communism? All people do is look at some tribal communities or small willful groups in that scale and think \"wow, this might work.\". This is honestly delusional, we don't even have a full scale model to work with.\n\nI am mostly a centrist liberal, and communistic ideals fail to convince even me. How are you going to convince far rights and the rich and the powerful who are much more adamant on the issue?\n\nThe fact is, you just can't. You have to force them (this is what Marx suggested), destroy and subjugate. Then you put militaristic power on the state, and once they are in power, they will refuse to come down, lol.\n\nHumans just be like that.\n\nRegarding the Ottomans comment, I meant the land that currently makes up Turkey, not Republic of Turkey under Ottomans rule. I admit i fucked that one up, I could have worded it better.\n\nand finally, yes my country is in shambles, yes its capitalism that's at fault, but we wouldn't even have been here with communistic ideals. Instead,  we'd be starving our asses and getting murdered in the streets for verbally dissing the all-mighty-figure, like North Korea.\nalhanathalas: Okay i'm not arguing about politics with a 17 year old. Bye.\npearoad: Dude, look. \n\nThe original guy i talked this over, we had different views. But still we tried to talk things over, and agreed that we aren't going nowhere when we realized our views were way to different to agree something on. Albeit heated, we had mostly a civil discussion.\n\n He brought in real examples, and real points that were decent.\n\nAll you did however, was call me names like a \"cunt\", \"a 17 year old\", or laugh at my points saying I know nothing while not explaining anything, and running away after I decided to have some discussions with you.\n\nYou are the one who's toxic AF here. Honestly i feel like you know how fragile your views are, which is why you can't engage in a real discussion.\n\nBut fine, I don't want to talk to likes of you too.

{"full_text": "Monteoas: Diamond tycoon in India pays for more than 236 fatherless brides to get married in a mass wedding\n\nUser019283: It's great to see good news coming out of India! And this one after that tycoon who built houses for the homeless as his daughter's wedding gift.\nChron300p: Now it's a philanthropic competition \nMoral_Gutpunch: Is that bad?\nserein: Not at all! Even when you're doing it for selfish reasons, if the outcome is beneficial, I'd say it's a good thing.\ndlawoff: Why are we assuming the person is doing it for selfish reasons? It sounds like straight up charitable goodness. \nXerithryem: Life is all about this magical chemical in our brains called \"dopamine\". It controls when, how, and why we feel \"good\" or \"rewarded\". Even the grandest  and most selfless philanthropist in history did so because helping people made him happy, made him feel good; it gave off dopamine.\n\nSo in scientific reality, everything anyone ever willingly does is for that one selfish reason - to get dopamine. \n\nNow, I'm not discounting a charitable effort. There are many other ways to supply dopamine without helping people, but it is still, by nature and scientific understanding, a selfless action to supply a selfish demand.\n\nAlthough I think it's fair to say that, beyond the scientific scope of life, this was a very nice and selfless thing to do for people that had it tough. In reality, it really just depends on how someone chooses to achieve their dopamine, because the innate selfishness within every human makes the world go around.\nI_Look_at_Stuff: There's a pretty valid argument that there's no such thing as altruism. I think it's true because of exactly what you just said\nGnomeChompksi: Yeah yeah, we all read Ayn Rand when we were teenagers. Valid is a bit of a stretch though.\nI_Look_at_Stuff: Eh, I wasn't that smart in high school. My \"valid argument\" comes from the stuff you should know podcast. \nmindscent: It's an intriguing story that makes sense at first but falls apart under just a little examination. \nI_Look_at_Stuff: Would you mind being my examination? Otherwise I'm going to go on believing altruism can never be real..\nmindscent: Are you asking me to explain more about what I meant? \nI_Look_at_Stuff: Exactly\nmindscent: Okay, sure. \n\nWell, to begin with, people who argue that it's impossible to ever be purely altruistic often don't have a very specific definition of \"altruism\" in mind. That's a problem, because you can't really argue for or against the existence of something without knowing what it is you even mean when you talk about it. \n\nSo, let's just use the following definition, and you can let me know if you'd like to change it for some reason. \n\nLet's say that *altruism* is a *motivator*: it's a *reason to act.* More specifically, let's say that altruism is what motivates you to do some action that will benefit someone else, regardless of whether or not the action will benefit you.  \n\nIt seems like this sort of motivation comes in degrees, that is, that your motivation for doing something can be very altruistic or just a little altruistic. \n\nWhen people deny that altruism is possible, they usually say that nothing we chose to do is ever truly selfless: ultimately, the only real motivator is your own self-interest. \n\nTo back up this claim, they might appeal to things like biology (dopamine, survival of the species, etc.) They'll take any given example of altruism and say, \"No,  that wasn't  *really* altruistic because you actually got something out of it, dopamine, better social standing, whatever.)\n\nThe first thing to notice about this kind of argument is that it's self-undermining. That's because it relies on the assumption that we can't take people's word for it when they tell us what motivates their actions. Actually, it's worse than that.  It assumes that no matter what it seems like to you, you can't take *your own word* for it when you think you've done something purely for the sake of someone else. \n\nBut, then, if that's true, why should we think that we can know that *selfishness* is a motivator? In other words, if you can't know what really motivates your own actions, then how can you ever know that selfishness motivates you? \n\nSo, anti-altruism seems to be a non-starter. \n\nMaybe the anti-altruist might come back and say, \"Well, hold on. There is objective, scientific evidence against altruism. That's why we should think it isn't a real motivator. It might *seem* real to us, but, science shows us the truth.\"\n\nThis isn't going to work as a defense of anti-altruism for several reasons.\n\n To begin with, it's straightforwardly false. We have no such scientific evidence of constant selfishness. To say otherwise is to confuse correlation with causation and speculation with observation. \n\nWhen we study people and their behaviors, we might find that people usually act in ways that won't lead to their death, or in ways that will extend their life. But, just because someone's behavior is generally \"self-preserving\" doesn't mean that their only motivation is to not die/keep living. Similarly, we might find that dopamine is usually released when someone helps someone else out, but that doesn't show that anticipation of dopamine is the reason for helping. \n\nScientific evidence is found by observing things, not by just *thinking* about things.  And, we never directly *observe* selfishness, nor do we observe anything that proves altruism never exists as a motivator.\n\n So, it's false to say that there's scientific evidence that it is the only motivator. That is, just because we can usually invent a story about why a person who thinks he acted altruistically was actually being selfish instead doesn't mean that he really was purely motivated by self-interests.  \n\nThe claim that every motivator is selfish is a theoretical claim, not a scientific one. And, the reasons people give for accepting it can just as easily work against it. So, it isn't a very good theory. \n\nThere's a lot more to say about this, but I'll leave it here so we can discuss it if you like. \n_ChestHair_: The foundation for your argument is total bunk.\n\n&gt;Well, to begin with, people who argue that it's impossible to ever be purely altruistic often don't have a very specific definition of \"altruism\" in mind. \n\n...No. People who argue that altruism is an illusion consider altruism as something that gives no benefit/good feeling/avoidance of negative feelings to the person taking action. This is basic shit and makes me wonder if you've literally just read about the concept and are just spouting shit because you can.\n\n&gt;Let's say that *altruism* is a *motivator*: it's a *reason to act.* More specifically, let's say that altruism is what motivates you to do some action that will benefit someone else, regardless of whether or not the action will benefit you.  \n\nNooooooo. Altruism being a \"motivator\" is half the argument that true altruism doesn't exist. It's a motivator to you because you get something out of it, hence it not being true altruism.\n\n&gt;The first thing to notice about this kind of argument is that itlf-undermining. That's because it relies on the assumption that we can't take people's word for it when they tell us what motivates their actions. Actually, it's worse than that.  It assumes that no matter what it seems like to you, you can't take *your own word* for it when you think you've done something purely for the sake of someone else. \n\nMisdirection, or more not understanding the oppositions argument here. Saying that something like the phrase \"I did it because it feels good to help others\" is not altruistic, is not saying that we can't take a person's word for something. We truly believe what they say. They **feel good** when they help someone. **They** feel good when they help someone. As in, they get something out of altruistic actions.\n\n&gt;But, then, if that's true, why should we think that we can know that *selfishness* is a motivator? In other words, if you can't know what really motivates your own actions, then how can you ever know that selfishness motivates you? \n\nFalse equivalence hinged on your argument above. What's more, we know from countless studies that reward systems and/or punishment avoidance can change behavioral patterns. Selfishness is proven to exist.\n\n&gt; To begin with, it's straightforwardly false. We have no such scientific evidence of constant selfishness. To say otherwise is to confuse correlation with causation and speculation with observation. \n\nProving that there is no such thing as altruism is proving a negative. It's usually impossible to prove a negative, but that doesn't mean that we don't view laws of physics as pillars of truth to rely on.\n\n&gt;When we study people and their behaviors, we might find that people usually act in ways that won't lead to their death, or in ways that will extend their life. But, just because someone's behavior is generally \"self-preserving\" doesn't mean that their only motivation is to not die/keep living. Similarly, we might find that dopamine is usually released when someone helps someone else out, but that doesn't show that anticipation of dopamine is the reason for helping. \n\n\"It feels good to help people,\" and social conditioning to \"do the right thing\" *easily* explain this argument away.\n\n&gt;Scientific evidence is found by observing things, not by just *thinking* about things.  And, we never directly *observe* selfishness, nor do we observe anything that proves altruism never exists as a motivator.\n\nMore proving a negative arguments.\n\n&gt; So, it's false to say that there's scientific evidence that it is the only motivator. That is, just because we can usually invent a story about why a person who thinks he acted altruistically was actually being selfish instead doesn't mean that he really was purely motivated by self-interests.  \n\nFirst off, no-one remotely knowledgeable in scientific proofing will say that correlation is proof of causation, so you're arguing with a strawman here. Secondly, you also can't prove that he *wasn't* purely motivated by self-interests, so your defense here breaks even with the opposing argument.\n\n&gt;The claim that every motivator is selfish is a theoretical claim, not a scientific one.\n\nAs is the argument that altruism exists.\n\n&gt;There's a lot more to say about this, but I'll leave it here so we can discuss it if you like.  \n\nPlease, continue.\nmindscent: I'm a grad student in theory of mind and cognition. \n\nI'm going to try something on the off chance that you're a deviant and are capable of entertaining the notion that you are fairly ignorant about most things (*i.e.*, on the off chance that you're smarter than most people.)\n\nYou are wrong and I am right. \n\nYou are using technical terms improperly. For example, you argue that it is fallacious to require someone to prove a negative claim. Yet, you either fail to notice or intentionally ignore the fact that *your entire position is based upon a negative claim.*\n\nIf it's likely impossible to prove a negative, *then it's likely impossible to support your position.* \n\nEta\n\nYou yourself acknowledge that the case for egoism stands and falls by the same reasoning as the case for altruism. Only, altruism may exist while selfish motivations also exist, but egoism cannot be true unless altruism never exists. So, *as I said*, your position undermines itself.  \n_ChestHair_: It's likely impossible to prove either position. Hence why it's a theory. I was refuting his argument against the non-existence of selflessness.\n\nEdit:\n&gt;Only, altruism may exist while selfish motivations also exist, but egoism cannot be true unless altruism never exists.\n\nWould you care to elaborate?\nmindscent: Egoism is the view that no act is entirely motivated by unselfishness. \n\nAltruism requires that the desire to help others in spite of any benefit or harm to oneself can motivate actions. \n\nSo, altruism allows that some actions may be purely selfish, and that some actions may be motivated by a desire to help others as well as secondarily by some selfish desire. \n\nSo, egoism is the stronger claim, and is therefore less easily shown to be tenable. \n\nTo support egoism, you'd have to show that there is good reason to deny the occurrence of altruistic actions in general, but the converse doesn't hold: altruism does not require that there are no selfish motivators. \n_ChestHair_: For the topic of whether selfishness always or sometimes never exists, you still need proof either way. You still need proof that selflessness is possible. Without that you can't technically prove either one, in which case both arguments are on equal footing. I don't see how anything you have said is in favor of one over the other.\nmindscent: I see where things got confused, here. \n\nI wasn't laying down any serious argument for altruism, although,  it does get some *de facto* credibility given what I said.  Instead, I was raising worries for egoism.  \n\nUltimately, the case for the existence of altruism is similar to the case for the existence of the particular taste of basil: direct, first person experience. I know basil has a certain taste because I've eaten basil, and I know that altruism motivates me because I've felt altruistic urgings. \n\nEta\n\nIncidentally, I accept the existence of selfishness for the same reason: I've experienced it directly.  \n \n_ChestHair_: The problem here is that the existence of the taste of basil is easily verified by chemical analysis. More abstract meanings can't currently be verified with technology, so when the source of a feeling is brought into question, there is value into looking at the theory.\n\nThe fact that altruistic things can make us feel good is a strong argument here that the \"make us feel good\" is the subconscious reason why we actually do it, meaning there is no true altruism.\n\nFor something like this, simply saying \"this is why I think I do it\" isn't enough to prove things one way or the other.\nmindscent: &gt;The problem here is that the existence of the taste of basil is easily verified by chemical analysis. \n\nNot at all, actually. The fact that the chemicals in basil have a certain affect on nerves in the tongue is verified that way. But, there is absolutely no way to verfiy whether basil's similar effects on my tongue and yours equate to us tasting identical flavors. \n\n&gt;More abstract meanings can't currently be verified with technology, so when the source of a feeling is brought into question, there is value into looking at the theory.\n\nSure, I agree. \n\n&gt;The fact that altruistic things can make us feel good is a strong argument here that the \"make us feel good\" is the subconscious reason why we actually do it, meaning there is no true altruism. \n\nAgain, you're assuming that the fact that it feels good means the action must have been done because it feels good.

{"full_text": "JuliettPapaRomeo: What to Do About Trump? The Same Thing My Grandfather Did in 1930s Vienna\n\nmichaelnoir: Let me sum this article up for you: \"I'm not saying Trump is literally Hitler, but Trump is literally Hitler though\".\n\nAlso, what exactly did his grandfather do in 1930s Vienna? \"He convinced two of his sisters to trade in a continental future for one less tender on the shores of Palestine...  His simple heart advised him to take the thugs at their word and leave.\"\n\nSo that's his advice to Americans on how to deal with Trump? Just leave the country? \nDietOfTheMind: Sorry you missed the point of the article, which is:\n\nTake Trump seriously, and be prepared to defend those he attacks.\nmichaelnoir: Which is exactly what his grandfather did *not* do! The obvious message of this article (perhaps unintended by the writer) was that if things are going badly for you in a country you ought to flee the country, not stay and fight. Good for you, if you can afford it. Bad luck to those who can't. \nDietOfTheMind: Because Trump is not as bad as Hitler.  You missed him saying explicitly saying that.  If he was, he would suggest Jews to run, just like his grandfather did.\n\nBasically it's this:  Hitler said he would do something bad to Jews, people pretended he wouldn't.  They were Jews, so they should have left.  Trump has not said anything too bad about Jews, so the advice is not to leave *yet*.  The advice is to protect people who are most persecuted, which is what *everyone else in Austria should've done for the Jews*.\nmichaelnoir: Yes, but not *what his grandfather did*, which makes the title inaccurate. He doesn't seem to have protected the Jews, but to have got himself and his family out of the country. That tells me that his grandfather was lucky enough, and wealthy enough, to escape the country, and the poorer Jews were left behind, to face the gas chambers. The grandfather of all people was the very one who did not support the Jews. The truth is that no-one supported the Jews.\n\nJust say Trump begins to persecute Mexicans (never going to happen, he only seems to have a problem with illegal immigrants). Should the Mexicans stay and fight, and support one another, or should they flee the country, as the grandfather did? What about the ones who can't afford to move to another country? \nFibonacci35813: Fine. Not the best title.  Maybe it should be more abstract : The lessons I learned from my grandfather.  \n\nHowever, the fact that you are judging an entire article based on the title is concerning.  \n\nBesides, Authors don't always get to choose their titles.  I'm not sure if that's the case here but it doesn't matter.  Don't judge an article on its title.\n\n\n\n\nmichaelnoir: I object to the premise of the whole article, which is that Trump is analogous to Hitler. Too many people have made that lazy comparison. I also think it's partly in bad taste to invoke the Holocaust and one's grandparents when you want to lend moral weight to any little point. The whole article is sanctimonious and misleading.\nInterestNews: Literal Holocaust survivors as well as historians have noted the comparisons between Hitler and Trump. This isn't the same as Godwin's law \nmichaelnoir: The comparisons only go so far as a bit of scapegoating of illegal immigrants and Muslims to get himself into power. He's not going to start rounding these people up and putting them into death camps at any point. So it's questionable how useful the analogy is.\nDietOfTheMind: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/11/16/is-the-trump-administration-really-going-to-launch-a-registry-for-muslims/\n\nUntil Trump shoots himself in the head outside of his bombed out bunker in DC, you can say \"I'm not sure how useful the analogy is\".  The problem with what you're saying is that you imply both that it's *impossible* for Trump to do these things, and that there's *no evidence* to suggest he might.  It's not impossible and there is evidence.  Part of what makes it possible is people constantly saying it *is* impossible, and thus that statement alone is all the defence we need.\n\nAgain, just to clarify, I don't think he's going to have death camps either, but we must block the path to death camps at every sign-post we know.  We failed in the election to do that, and if we allow him to consider the possibility of making a Muslim registration, we'll fail at the next post too, and on and on it can go if we let it, if he wants to.\n", "prompt": "JuliettPapaRomeo: What to Do About Trump?

I have a bit of experience (did this once before), but wanted advice on if my plans sound reasonable or if there are some glaringly obvious mistakes.\n\nAt our current condo, the shower area is 30\"x 60\" with clips to fix the curtain against a side to avoid water splashing out everywhere. The shower pan doesn't have any barrier, so we have a collapsible membrane for her chair to roll over sorta like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Collapsible-Threshold-Wheelchair-Accessible-Accessibility/dp/B07YYW3BCF?th=1). Me or whoever showers her (she's a quadriplegic) gets into the shower with her, but as we look for homes  my plan is that we'll likely have to settle for a smaller shower area, say 30\"x45\" and the person showering her stands outside of the shower. We'd replace a tub with a similar shower pan and membrane setup. We could have the curtain lowered to about hip level for the person standing and use lower water pressure to prevent water from splashing too crazy. If the floor is not tiled already, then I'd do so to make the area waterproof and have tiled trim around the floor. \n\nDoes this seem like a decent plan or am I overlooking something? I do realize ADA compliance standards require 30\"x60\" as the minimum, but home buying at this time is already difficult and  we should be fine with 30\"x45\" if the aide stands outside the shower area.\n\nThanks for the help.\nchoate51: Setup looks reasonable. Have you possibly considered turning the bathroom into a wet room instead of just the shower area? \n\n I've converted a bathroom into a wet room so there was more room for my SO when she needs it for her bad days (MS) and is something I wanted to mention since you already are doing tile.\nsaturnineoranje: Actually that does sound ideal about a wet room, but given my limited experience I'm kind of nervous about it if I were to do a curbless shower\ndominus_aranearum: Look into doing Wedi products for rebuilding a shower or creating a wet room. Their products are waterproof and have an insurance backed warranty that exceeds all others. It is easy to install provided you follow the instructions.\n\nI would not use the existing tile as you've no way to know how adequate the current waterproofing is. Tile and grout themselves are not waterproof.\nsaturnineoranje: Cool, I'll check em out! Thank you\nelizzup: Seconding (Thirding?) advice on converting it to a wet room. I know a lot of folks are talking about needing a tub for resale value, but a good wet room will be more advantageous than a bathtub you'll never use.   \n\nDon't stress about resale. You're the one living in the house, and things are tough enough with a quadriplegic partner as it is. Make sure that the space suits your needs now.

I placed it in the top of a custom-made, free-standing pantry, and it fits pretty good (it has maybe an inch of extra space on each side and maybe 2.5-3\" of space above it) but when I open the door it rocks front to back. My friend who is an electrician said that this kind of oven is designed to be mounted and not placed on a cabinet or counter.    \n\nI bought the oven several months ago because of a really good sale, and when I opened it a few days ago there was a thin crack on the display so I took it back. They didn't want to accept the return because it had been over a month, so I had to talk to a supervisor and then the store manager, so I probably can't take it back and it fits really good and matches my other appliances so I want to use it but I'm not sure how to properly secure it.    \n\nI purchased stick on grips to go under the legs since they're solid metal, but I don't know what to do to prevent the rocking. I was thinking that if I got a pretty thick foam wedge that expanded then I could stick it in the back of the cabinet with the thickest side towards the back, and then slide the oven in and as the foam expanded it would push down slightly on the oven and prevent it from rocking much. This seems like it might not be secure enough though, so another thought I had was if I drill two small holes in the top of the cabinet (over each of the back corners of the oven where the hanging screws are supposed to go) then I could put a machine screw bolt (a machine screw without a head) in each of these holes and screw it in and then thread some type of special nut on until it meets the top of the cabinet so these bolts would hold it in place.     \n\nhttp://www.frigidaire.com/products/Kitchen/Microwaves/FGMV154CLF.aspx\ndavey_darling: Your electrician friend was right, and the appliance guy was feeding you a line of bs (or he just didn't know what he was talking about)\n\nThat said there likely isn't great danger in operating the unit this way.\n\nIf the cabinet it is mounted in has a top you could consider mounting it as it was intended - hanging from the top of the cabinet.\nYeah_anuses: Yeah, you got swindled.

Not the most elegant solution but if you're handy enough to create a facade to cover the gap it shouldn't look too bad. The only bad news is you'll have some goofiness in the shelf above the micro, since your power cord and some screws will be there.\nmemento22mori: The bracket wont quite fit properly, if I did use it then it'd end up being too far back in the cabinet by a few inches so it'd look strange.

{"full_text": "RationalHeretic23: CMV: Superstition is false\nI reject the idea of superstition because there is no way in which the proposed cause(e.g. wearing lucky underwear) can bring about the effect(e.g. winning a football game).\n\nMy problem with superstition is that it fails to account for the principle of causality. What I mean by that is just that for every effect, there is a cause. Every effect is preceded by a cause that is causally linked to the effect. Therefore, there is a causal relationship between causes and their effects. This is not to be confused with a correlation. The well-known phrase \u201ccorrelation does not equal causation\u201d is extremely important here. Two things can be correlated with absolutely no causal relationship linking the two. The problem is that oftentimes people observe a correlation and automatically assume that they are causally related. I think this is one of the things that leads to belief in superstition. But let\u2019s consider an example of superstition to make this clearer.\n\nSo let's think of a classic example of superstition. Wearing lucky underwear helps OU sooners win at football. The cause in this situation is wearing lucky underwear. The effect is OU winning at football. For there to be a true causal relationship between the cause and effect in this situation, there must be a mechanism by which wearing lucky underwear results in OU winning at football. But, it is impossible to conceive of a way in which wearing lucky underwear could affect what happens in a football game. If you're at home watching a football game, there's nothing you can do to affect what happens during that football game. To disagree with that statement, I think one needs to provide an explanation of the way in which the cause brings about the effect. Therefore, my position is that those who posit a supernatural cause for any given effect must provide an explanation of the way in which the cause brings about the effect.\n\nIt is likely that some might agree with me in my statement that there always needs to be a mechanism by which causes bring about effects, but they might disagree that this mechanism needs to be explainable. In other words, one might argue that there is a mechanism by which wearing lucky underwear affects an OU football game, but that we simply do not understand this mechanism. Perhaps the mechanism is by some supernatural means that we are incapable of understanding.\n\nMy response would be to ask why we should be inclined to take seriously any posited causal relationship that is without any explanation of the mechanism linking the cause and effect, when there are numerous other posited causal relationships from which to choose that do have such an explanation. In other words, why should I believe that lucky underwear affects an OU game, even though there is no explanation for such an idea, when I can believe that the OU game is affected by the skill of the team's players? I propose an alternate causal relationship in which I am much more inclined to believe. In my proposed causal relationship, the skill of the team's players is the cause, and the result of the OU game is the effect. In my example, it is easy to understand the mechanism by which the cause brings about the effect. Team skill influences the ability of the team to play well, which in turn influences the score of the game. So basically what I'm saying is that there is no reason to believe in a cause that has no explanation when I can believe in a cause that has a clear and undeniable explanation. \n\nIt is likely that one might fully agree with me that we should always accept a natural explanation over a supernatural one when we have access to the natural explanation. However, they might go on to say that we are entirely justified in believing supernatural explanations when we have no natural explanations to oppose the supernatural one. I disagree with this, and I believe the best way to argue against such an idea is to appeal to history. Now, the problem is that we humans have not always had natural explanations from which to choose when attempting to understand an observed phenomenon. Historically, it has often been the case that we observed some phenomena, unexplainable by the science of the time, and therefore we were inclined to believe in a supernatural explanation. This instilled in us a habit of reliance upon supernatural explanations, which remains vestigial in society today. Fortunately science has dramatically progressed throughout time and has subsequently disproven time and time again many of the supernatural explanations once commonly held in society. We can easily observe the historical pattern that has been occurring. We observe a phenomenon unexplainable by natural means at the time. We then conceive of some supernatural explanation. Then science progresses and proves that this phenomenon transpired naturally the entire time, we just didn't understand how. \n\nSo for the sake of clarification, I want to present the two different scenarios discussed here. In each of these scenarios, there is a phenomenon that we observe and we then attribute a cause to it. These two scenarios differ from each other in that those in the first scenario have access to natural explanations that oppose the supernatural explanations, but the second scenario does not have any natural explanation to oppose the supernatural explanation.\n\n1) This is the example of the OU game. We observe an effect, OU winning the game, and attribute a cause. First, there is a posited supernatural cause (wearing lucky underwear). This supernatural cause has no explanation of how it could have brought about the effect. Second, there is a posited natural cause (team skill level). This natural cause has an undisputable causal relationship with the effect and provides an undeniable explanation of how it could bring about the effect. Therefore, in scenarios such as this one, there is no reason to accept the supernatural cause, having no explanation, when there is a natural cause with a clear explanation.\n\n2) The second scenario is the historical scenario I mentioned earlier. In this scenario, there are no natural explanations for the effect we are observing. We simply do not understand what is causing the effect. For example, a society many years ago observes a lunar eclipse turn the moon red. Their understanding of astronomy is not sufficient enough to understand the natural cause for this observed phenomenon, and so they therefore conceive of a supernatural cause. This is different from the first scenario in that there was no known natural explanation for the red moon. In circumstances such as these, I argue that it is always better to simply acknowledge our ignorance as a species and realize there might be some things we can\u2019t explain at the time rather than to attribute a supernatural cause. History has consistently proven that supernatural explanations are unable to withstand the test of time, and eventually are replaced by natural explanations once we gain the ability to understand the phenomenon. Therefore, we should learn from history by taking note of our historical tendency to falsely conceive of supernatural causes. Instead, we need to realize that knowledge is not a closed book, and that simply because we don\u2019t have a natural explanation for something, doesn\u2019t mean that such an explanation doesn\u2019t exist, regardless of it being inaccessible by us.\n\nSo, in both of these two scenarios I am arguing that believing in a supernatural cause is the incorrect course of action.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

All effects have a natural cause, regardless of whether or not we understand how the cause brings about the effect.\ncaw81: I think your argument is \"All things in nature is caused by nature.  If its not caused by nature, its just that we haven't found the cause of it.\"\n\nYou seem to preemptively dismiss evidence of a non-natural cause claiming ignorance or some sort of axiom.  \"It can't be supernatural, there *must* be a natural cause we don't know yet\". What is your support for this claim that it must be natural?  \nRationalHeretic23: There has never been a demonstrated occurrence of any supernatural phenomena existing. Supernatural claims have been posited for millennia, only to be later rejected by more informed epochs. I am wondering why one should even consider a cause anything but natural, when nothing other than natural phenomena has ever been confirmed to exist. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is any other means by which causes can bring about effects other than natural means.\ncaw81: &gt; There has never been a demonstrated occurrence of any supernatural phenomena existing.\n\nThat's not proof of anything.  Its a problem of induction.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction\n\n&gt; I am wondering why one should even consider a cause anything but natural, when nothing other than natural phenomena has ever been confirmed to exist.\n\nBecause the lack of confirmation of existence is not proof of \"it does not exist\".\nRationalHeretic23: I agree with you. I am not arguing that I am certain that supernatural phenomena does not exist, because such an argument would be against the principles of science. Science doesn't set out to \"disprove\" things, but rather it sets out to determine the plausibility of certain claims. What I am arguing is that given that there is no evidence for anything other than natural phenomena, the existence of supernatural phenomena is highly improbable, and is therefore an unreasonable idea in which to believe.\ncaw81: &gt;  I am not arguing that I am certain that supernatural phenomena does not exist, \n\nYour CMV is \"Superstition is false\".\n\n&gt; What I am arguing is that given that there is no evidence for anything other than natural phenomena,\n\nThis is nowhere in your View.  In the View you try to make a case; \"My problem with superstition is that it fails to account for the principle of causality. \"  This is not the lack of evidence but the lack of \"principle of causality\".  \n\n&gt;  the existence of supernatural phenomena is highly improbable, and is therefore an unreasonable idea in which to believe.\n\nSaying something is \"highly improbable\" and \"unreasonable\" is different from saying something is \"false\".  There is no hedging in the later.\n\nRationalHeretic23: \u2206\n\nYou have convinced me about my title. I did not put much thought into it at the time, but I now agree that I should not say that \"Superstition is false\". I guess after rethinking it, I should have had my title as \"Evidence for the validity of superstition is non-existent, and therefore should not be considered true\". That is my main point I'm trying to get across. \n\nWhat I mean when I say \"My problem with superstition is that it fails to account for the principle of causality\" is that those who believe in superstition fail to recognize that there must be a causal relationship between an effect and what brings about an effect. Believers in superstition will often say things like, \"walking under this tower will result in one taking an extra year to graduate\"(a common belief at my university). My response is to ask what the causal relationship is between walking under the tower and taking an extra year to graduate. They simply are unable to give a mechanism by which the cause brings about the effect. \n\nI stand by the importance of considering the principle of causality when thinking about superstition. However, you are right to criticize my title for saying \"Superstition is false\".\ncaw81: &gt; those who believe in superstition fail to recognize that there must be a causal relationship between an effect and what bring about an effect\n\n* You don't have that same level of evidence for unexplained things that you an assume there is a natural cause for.  \"We just don't know of the natural cause, yet.\" is more hand-waving than demanding causation that you require for superstitions.  \n\n* \"Invisible tower fairies that live in another dimension will cause you to to take an extra year.  It is their purpose in life.\"  Now I've given you the causal relationship, so now you will consider superstitions to be true.\nRationalHeretic23: It is a fact that there must be a causal relationship between an effect and what brings about an effect. This is a philosophical fact. Me saying \"we just don't know of the natural cause, yet\" does not mean that a causal relationship does not exist. To clarify, I am not demanding causation to be required for only superstition. I am demanding causation to be required for all phenomena. All effects have a cause. There is no evidence of anything other than natural causes taking place. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to believe that supernatural causes affect our Universe.\ncaw81: &gt; To clarify, I am not demanding causation to be required for only superstition. I am demanding causation to be required for all phenomena\n\nThat's not in your View.  You excuse it away;  \"Instead, we need to realize that knowledge is not a closed book, and that simply because we don\u2019t have a natural explanation for something, doesn\u2019t mean that such an explanation doesn\u2019t exist, regardless of it being inaccessible by us.\"  So \"No supernatural cause then it doesn't exist, the book is closed\" but \"No natural cause then it still might exist, the book is still open\".  Why two different rules?\n\nAnd what about my \"invisible faeries\" causation?  Shouldn't that demand your \"causation\" requirement?\n\n\nRationalHeretic23: It is in my view. At the beginning I said, \"for every effect, there is a cause. Every effect is preceded by a cause that is causally linked to the effect.\" Notice I said *every* effect is causally linked. This means that I am saying that causation is always required. \n\nYou quoted \"Instead, we need to realize that knowledge is not a closed book, and that simply because we don\u2019t have a natural explanation for something, doesn\u2019t mean that such an explanation doesn\u2019t exist, regardless of it being inaccessible by us.\" Let me address this. What I mean is that there is always a cause for every effect, regardless of whether or not we understand it. Sometimes, we do not have access to enough to information to understand the natural process by which something occurs. This doesn't mean that there isn't a cause for whatever effect we don't understand. It just means that we are not aware of the cause. My point is that in instances like this, when we don't know the cause, we shouldn't immediately assume that there must be a supernatural cause. Not understanding how something could have happened naturally does not mean that it must have happened supernaturally. All this means is that there is information that we do not know about how how something happened. There is only evidence for the Universe behaving in one way, naturally. Therefore, what I am saying is that just because we don't understand the natural process by which something occurred, doesn't mean we should posit an entirely different idea of how the Universe behaves (supernaturally), even though there is no evidence for the Universe behaving in such a way. Instead of proposing an entirely different idea of how the universe behaves that has no evidence supporting it, we should recognize that there is likely a natural explanation we don't understand, which therefore does not propose an entirely different idea of how the Universe behaves.\n\nRegarding your Fairies example, it absolutely demands my causation requirement, which you would be unable to meet. You propose that the fairies \"cause\" me to stay another year. My response is that there needs to be a causal relationship between the actions of the fairies (the cause) and me taking an extra year of school (the effect). In other words, there needs to exist a mechanism by which the actions of the fairies could bring about me taking an extra year. Me taking an extra year *must* be the result of something happening, or there must be some reason for me taking an extra year. In that sense, it is clear that this situation demands my causation requirement. If we observed that all of those who walk under the tower actually take an extra year to graduate, then one should surely consider the proposition of tower fairies. But, the important thing is that we don't observe things like this! Suppose 100% of those who walk under the tower take an extra year. This would be evidence that there is some sort of causal relationship between walking under the tower and taking an extra year to graduate. It is impossible to conceive of a natural way in which walking under a clock tower would result in taking an extra year. Therefore, if such a situation occurred, then by all means we should consider supernaturalism. The thing is, situations like this do NOT occur. Any time someone postulates a supernatural causation, there is always either a more reasonable and plausible natural causation that we are aware of, or there is a natural causation that we are unaware of. Why do I assume that there is a natural causation that we are unaware of? Because there is no evidence of the Universe behaving in any other way than naturally.\n\n\ncaw81: &gt; Notice I said every effect is causally linked. This means that I am saying that causation is always required. \n\nWhere is the demand for causation when you say \" In circumstances such as these, I argue that it is always better to simply acknowledge our ignorance as a species and realize there might be some things we can\u2019t explain at the time rather than to attribute a supernatural cause.\"\n\n&gt; It just means that we are not aware of the cause.\n\nYou mean \"we are not aware of the *natural* cause\".  \n\n&gt; when we don't know the cause, we shouldn't immediately assume that there must be a supernatural cause. \n\nBut you discard the other way \"since we don't know the supernatural cause we shouldn't immediately assume there must be a natural cause\".  There is no justification for discarding this one but not the other.\n\n&gt; There is only evidence for the Universe behaving in one way, naturally. \n\nBut lack of evidence is not proof of non-existence.  Yet your whole assumption is that it does.\n\n&gt; what I am saying is that just because we don't understand the natural process by which something occurred, doesn't mean we should posit an entirely different idea of how the Universe behaves (supernaturally), even though there is no evidence for the Universe behaving in such a way.\n\nBut your alternative has problems too.  \"We don't know what the natural cause is, but lets accept that there is one\"  Why is one more acceptable than another?\n\n&gt; there needs to exist a mechanism by which the actions of the fairies could bring about me taking an extra year.\n\nI can just say the mechanism is that \"faeries then follow you around and randomly/creatively cause the extra year, depend on the person's circumstances\".  But you don't demand this mechanism when you say \"we just don't know the natural cause yet\".  The natural cause mechanism is totally absent yet its acceptable.  \n\n&gt; Suppose 100% of those who walk under the tower take an extra year. This would be evidence that there is some sort of causal relationship between walking under the tower and taking an extra year to graduate.  It is impossible to conceive of a natural way in which walking under a clock tower would result in taking an extra year. Therefore, if such a situation occurred, then by all means we should consider supernaturalism.\n\nReally?  So 100% of the time I rub my lucky rabbits foot something lucky happens to me within the next month (and I explain it by saying invisible fairies) , this is a causal relationship and so supernatural?  Because it did happen 100% of the time I rubbed by lucky rabbit foot the three times I did it.  So you accept this as evidence of the supernatural?\n\n&gt; Why do I assume that there is a natural causation that we are unaware of? Because there is no evidence of the Universe behaving in any other way than naturally.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that there is no supernatural causation.  Lack of evidence doesn't mean proof of non-existence.\nRationalHeretic23: 1) Acknowledging our ignorance as a species and recognizing that we may observe effects with natural causes we don't yet understand does not in any way negate the demand for causation. A cause exists, we just don't fully understand it.\n\n2) Yes, I mean we are not aware of the natural cause. It still exists, though.\n\n3 &amp; 4) There absolutely is justification for discarding one but not the other. Again, I agree with you that lack of evidence does not equal non-existence. I am not arguing for the non-existence of supernaturalism, just as I would not argue for the non-existence of an invisible flying teapot orbiting mars.[Please read the first paragraph of this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot)\nWe know for a fact that effects are brought about by natural means all the time in the Universe. A naturally behaving Universe is the one assumption that we agree on, you just want to posit that there is another way (supernaturally) in which the Universe can sometimes behave in addition to naturally. I'm arguing that there is no reason to consider such an idea when there is no evidence of such a phenomenon existing. Since there is no evidence of supernaturalism existing, it is highly improbable to exist when compared to naturalism. Therefore I do not reject supernaturalism because I am sure it does not exist, I reject it because naturalism has a far greater probability of existing.\n\n5) Why is one more acceptable than another? Because again, we know that the Universe frequently behaves naturally. Therefore it is not surprising in any way to conceive of a natural mechanism that we simply do not understand. In fact, this has happened countless times during our history! 5,000 years ago, we didn't understand how the body functions, how life evolves, how planets form, why there are seasons, and many more natural phenomena. But guess what, we eventually found out that these things occur naturally! Therefore it is not surprising to imagine that this trend might continue into the future, as we will continue to learn more about the nature of the Universe. In fact it would be foolish to not leave open the possibility that there are and will be natural phenomena we do not fully understand. Conversely, it would be extremely surprising to accept that the Universe behaves supernaturally, because this is contrary to every piece of information we know about the Universe. There has not been a single piece of evidence to show us that supernaturalism affects our Universe. YES, I understand that this does not mean that supernaturalism does not exist! However, it is far more foolish to equate the possibility of an entirely different interpretation of the Universe that has no evidence for it whatsoever with the idea that we simply don't know everything about how nature works.\n \n6) I DO demand the mechanism when I say we don't know the natural cause yet. I think I spotted the confusion, though. I demand there to be a mechanism that we do not understand. And yes, in the fairy situation I also demand there to be a mechanism that we do not understand. In both situation there is a mechanism that we do not understand. Therefore, I am not rejecting either idea on the basis of there being a mechanism that we do not understand. What distinguishes the fairy situation is that the mechanism that we do not understand is *contrary* to all of our observations of the Universe. The natural mechanism that we do not understand is not contrary to all of our observations of the Universe. Therefore it is far more plausible that the natural mechanism that is not contrary to our observations of the Universe is true, rather than the supernatural mechanism that is completely contrary to our observations of the Universe. \n\n7) No. This is confusing correlation with causation. Take an entire class of freshman and make ALL of them walk through the tower. Let's also assume that there has never in history been an entire freshman class to have taken 5 years to graduate. Now, if literally 100% of those freshmen take 5 years to graduate, then it is an indication of the *plausibility* that a causal relationship exists between walking under the tower and taking an extra year to graduate.\n\n8) Again, of course that doesn't mean there is absolutely no supernatural causation. That's not the point. The goal is to weigh the probability of each option and then make our decision based upon which option is more probable. But why in the world would one believe that instead of there being an unknown natural cause, as there has been countless number of times throughout humanity's progression, there exists instead a cause that is dependent upon a principle that has no evidence of even existing. In the end what it comes down to is weighing the probability of a natural explanation, which is highly probable considering this has been the outcome of LITERALLY every piece of information humanity has ever obtained, with the probability of a supernatural explanation, which is highly improbable considering there is no evidence of such a phenomenon even existing. \n", "prompt": "RationalHeretic23: CMV: Superstition is false\nI reject the idea of superstition because there is no way in which the proposed cause(e.g. wearing lucky underwear) can bring about the effect(e.g. winning a football game).\n\nMy problem with superstition is that it fails to account", "orig": "for the principle of causality.

{"full_text": "FullyVaccinatedCat: CMV: You should take the vaccine\nI don't understand why anyone would refuse the vaccine. It's literally free, safe, and effective against Covid-19.\n\nThe data shows that the vaccines are keeping us safe right now from the virus. And there are high [hospitalization rates for unvaccinated areas](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/18/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html). And the vaccine is [effective](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/15/health/cdc-covid-risk-higher-unvaccinated/index.html). Now whether or not it should be mandates necessarily is up for debate but I think the people should want to take it.\n\nI am open-minded to understanding this. My cousin is anti-vaxx and I tried talking to him. But he gave me a bunch of nonsense about how the media, government, and politicians are trying to force people to take it. Even if this was true, why not just do what they say? It causes no harm and will make being a wage slave easier, right?\n\nYou, the reader, should get vaccinated. Unless you have some health condition that prevents you from taking it, ordered by a medical professional, or unless you're a child, you need to roll up your sleeves and get vaccinated.\n\n(My mind has been changed. Perhaps the vaccine isn't for everyone)\nanti1media: If you are vaccinated, you shouldn\u2019t care about others vaccination status. That is the whole point of a functional vaccine and personal choice. The only reason someone needs is \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d. A simple \u201cno\u201d would suffice. Their bodily autonomy is not your concern. You taking the vaccine doesn\u2019t protect anyone but yourself. Therefore, they only hurt themselves.\n\nMy problem isn\u2019t the vaccine or the unvaccinated. My problem is the government thinking it\u2019s their job to enforce and threaten a mandate and loss of employment. Taking away a persons job is akin to killing them. It is disgustingly immoral and unethical. I did not vote for people to have them demand I shove a needle in my arm by threat or intimidation.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; You taking the vaccine doesn\u2019t protect anyone but yourself. \n\nWrong. It affects those around you who can\u2019t be vaccinated and it creates other variants which will affect everyone. You are dead wrong.\nanti1media: The people that can\u2019t get vaccinated can always continue wearing masks and distancing. No one is stopping them from protecting themselves.\n\nCovid is animal transmissible. New variants will form regardless. If 100% of the world was vaccinated, covid would not disappear or stop mutating. You\u2019re wrong.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; The people that can\u2019t get vaccinated can always continue wearing masks and distancing. \n\nYou said the vaccine only protects the person who gets it. That\u2019s patently false. And the vaccine is IMMENSELY more effective than the *other* person wearing a mask. Remember the primary function of masks is to stop sick people from spreading it. This unvaccinated maskless person is putting anyone he comes in contact with in danger if that person can\u2019t get vaccinated. That other person wearing a mask will only marginally help them. \n\n&gt; No one is stopping them from protecting themselves.\n\nThis is what you need to understand. **They cannot protect themselves**. \n\n&gt; New variants will form regardless. \n\nNo they won\u2019t. Not if cases are low enough. Variation comes through spread. Less spread, less variation.\nanti1media: 1. The vaccine only protects the person who takes it is categorically true. While vaccinated you can still catch and spread the virus at seemingly the exact same rates. While some areas around the world are showing higher infection rates while vaccinated. If the point is to protect those who can\u2019t get vaccinated\u2026 but you can still spread the virus while vaccinated\u2026 tell me what it is stopping? It\u2019s stopping symptoms from occurring and allowing people to spread it at a higher rate without recognition of even being infected.\n\n2. You\u2019re 100% wrong. Fauci and the CDC have already made the statement about variants and agree with me. This virus is animal transmissible and SARS is already a mutated animal virus to begin with.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; While vaccinated you can still catch and spread the virus at seemingly the exact same rates.\n\nWrong. Quit pretending to be a scientist. You\u2019re fucking it up. Vaccinated people *can* become just as contagious as unvaccinated people. But the RATE that vaccinated people have breakthrough infections is IMMENSELY lower than unvaccinated people. \n\n&gt; You\u2019re 100% wrong. Fauci and the CDC have already made the statement about variants and agree with me.\n\nProve it. [Because he\u2019s pretty unequivocal here](https://www.deseret.com/platform/amp/coronavirus/2021/10/10/22716452/dr-fauci-new-covid-19-variant-spread). Vaccines and social distancing are how to stop new variants.\nanti1media: Surprise, your wrong. Again. Unvaccinated can\u2019t have breakthrough infections. Seeing as breakthrough infections strictly refers to people that are vaccinated getting infections. You don\u2019t understand the phrases you are using. Which tells me you\u2019re mimicking words from someone else and doing no research on your own.\n\nFauci did an interview where he explicitly stated that every person alive could be vaccinated and the virus would not go away because of animal transmissibility. To which other scientists have greatly agreed. Let\u2019s pretend you have no degree but have lots of common sense. If you are vaccinated but no animals are, and they can still catch it.. will it go away? Or will it continue to mutate? Let\u2019s remember the original cause of covid and the original theory that it evolved in bats to begin with.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; Unvaccinated can\u2019t have breakthrough infections\n\n\u2026I never said they did. You are quite lost. Or your reading comprehension is subpar. It should be obvious to any functionally literate person that I was comparing breakthrough infections in vaccinated people to infections rates among unvaccinated. \u201cBreakthrough infection\u201d automatically only means vaccinated people. \n\n&gt; You don\u2019t understand the phrases you are using.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I lost you here. You said \u201cWhile vaccinated you can still catch and spread the virus at seemingly the exact same rates.\u201d That is patently false. Breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are MUCH lower than regular infections in unvaccinated people. \n\n&gt; Fauci did an interview where he explicitly stated that every person alive could be vaccinated and the virus would not go away because of animal transmissibility. \n\n1. Cite that. \n\n2. Explain how that affects herd immunity. \n\n3. Square that with his explicit recommendation (which I cited) that says everyone should get vaccinated and social distance in order to stop new variants.\nNoRecommendation8689: If a vaccinated person catches covid and an unvaccinated person catches covid they will transmit the virus to other people at exactly the same rates. The difference is that the vaccinated person won't know that they are contagious, while the unvaccinated person will at least have some indication that they are sick. There has been almost no asymptomatic transmission of covid. What there have been is very mild symptom transmission or an even more rare cases pre-symptomatic transmission. People who never become symptomatic at all do not transmit the disease, unless they're vaccinated.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; If a vaccinated person catches covid and an unvaccinated person catches covid they will transmit the virus to other people at exactly the same rates.\n\nBut that unvaccinated person is SIX times more likely to catch it in the first place. \n\n&gt; while the unvaccinated person will at least have some indication that they are sick. \n\nNot true. Most covid is *spread* before the victim shows any symptoms. Even if they ultimately die. That\u2019s how insidious this virus is. We\u2019ve known this for over a year. Where have you been?\n\n&gt; There has been almost no asymptomatic transmission of covid. \n\nThat is patently false. \n\n&gt; People who never become symptomatic at all do not transmit the disease,\n\n[Utterly false.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20people%20who,designed%20to%20prevent%20spread.)\n\n* \u201cIn fact, people who are infected may be more likely to spread the illness if they are asymptomatic.\u201d\nNoRecommendation8689: The most extensive study on this to date showed a 0.3 asymptomatic transmission rate, and that was amongst people known to have covid and known to where the covid came from. You are just absolutely wrong and you haven't bothered to read anything that the CDC just hasn't spoon-fed directly into your mouth.\nphilly_steak_cheese: Show me your source. You have yet to do that with any of your spamming. I\u2019ve given you half a dozen sources and you just plug your ears and go \u201clalalalala.\u201d\n\n1. I suspect 0.3 asymptomatic transmission refers to people who NEVER got symptoms. Most asymptotic transmission was PRE symptom. So they wouldn\u2019t be in that group since they were ultimately NOT asymptomatic. \n\n2. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to really track asymptomatic spread because, shockingly, asymptomatic people don\u2019t tend to get tested and traced.\nNoRecommendation8689: And you post summaries from CBS news, the organization that literally photoshopped a handgun out of the frame to pretend like the police that shot the perpetrator wasn't justified.

Full size pictures of one exercise when a smaller one would do. Huge margins and large type.\n\nThat being said- Naked Warrior is different from CC and may not offer what you are looking for. It focuses on techniques for tension to help you do one arm pushup and the pistol. Shows some progressions, but these boil down to manipulating height to make exercise easier.

While you have faith in preachers who sold you miracles, prophecies, prayer, creation, heaven and hell, absolute morality, virgin births, resurrections, scapegoating for 10% on your earnings and who demand you never test it. And you have no means to demonstrate any of those to me.\nBiker93: None of those things have to do with morality .\nbitee1: A literal Adam and Eve as said in the bible are proven false by evolution, common sense of incest and genetics. Talking snakes are proven false by basic anatomy. The entire story is based on that literal - original sin.  There was no \"original sin\". Without that there was no need for Jesus. The biblical age of the earth is proven false by many dating systems - radioactivity  and carbon, including the speed of light. The Exodus story left no evidence, the Egyptians did not use slaves to build the pyramids. The Egyptians recorded things even that were unflattering and there was no mention of 2 million Jews leaving in their records or the 10 plagues as bible described. The 2 million Jews traveling about 1000 miles over 40 years left no evidence. It took about 6 months to a year and a half to cross the U.S. by wagon - 2000 miles. \"Going\" with god doesn't seem to get you very far.\nNoah's ark was copied from other flood stories, millions of land animals could not have fit on any boat for half a year, then repopulated the earth again - incest and genetics. There is not enough water to cover all the mountains - 5 miles high. All the fish would have died. Before the 10 commandments was Hammurabi's code. \nThere is still pain in childbirth, Jesus did not fix that- so we had to. Jesus allegedly paid for the original sin but no changes to the punishments of it were made Genesis 3:16. Many parts of the Jesus story and Christian traditions were taken from other religions including- attributes of Jesus that were taken from other gods personified, Christmas and Easter - are stolen pagan holidays.  No known bible (and unforged) author claimed to have seen Jesus. The gospels were not written by known authors. The Jesus story was not documented at all outside of the bible during or near his life, the gospel stories were written 30-80 years after Jesus would have died. There was not a census then, nor a documented slaughter of innocents. Jesus was a false prophet (he did not fulfill the OT prophecies, he made prophecies that did not happen), and that is just part of why there are still Jews. OT Prophecies were made up in the NT just to say that Jesus filled them. Jesus has a lineage to people who never existed as written. The people in the bible's later books like Jesus saw the bible base stories as literal.\nThere never was anything called sin, it is made up to sell you an imaginary cure. \nThere are only crimes against humanity and others - religion is one of the worst. People still hate, kill and torture others and they use their religion to excuse it. All the people that have faith believe in is nothing more than imaginary evidence and it is based on empty claims from other deluded people. Any god can not be tested or replicated in any method. It is not provably based in reality and the burden of proof is on the one who claims it exists. You can not have faith and evidence. If everything needs a creator so does god and you know man made thousands of them out of fear and ignorance. Yours is not a special case just because you were born in the \"right\" country and the \"right\" family to find that exact version of your god. Religious \"convictions\" are based on geography and family history very rarely do people find a god that does not fit those two criteria. 80-90% of Christians have not read all of the bible, and that is the best book someone can read to become an atheist. But that is why credulous people have faith, so they don't need evidence or facts.  Without empirical evidence for the bible god - the Jesus story means absolutely nothing. Belief in book claimed miracles based in hearsay by unknown authors is a denial of reality.\nBiker93: You\u2019re proving my point, this entire rant has nothing to do with the question I asked you proving you are not an honest player here.  Every biblical example you used involved predatory, opportunistic interpretation again proving you\u2019re not an honest player here. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, you have the biblical literacy of snake handlers.  You have the scientific literacy of a 14 year old who\u2019s watched NOVA a couple times.  Example, you claim with authority you know the age of the earth.  You use that as a tool to prove the Bible is wrong.  You then go on to say we know the age of the earth because of carbon dating.  That is nonsense, carbon dating has nothing to do with the age of the earth.  You assume an authority you don\u2019t have or deserve, use tools like science which you don\u2019t understand to disprove the Bible which you also don\u2019t understand.  Also known as a bigot.\n\nAnd people don\u2019t need religion to be horrible to each other.  If anything it\u2019s a restraining influence.  Just look at what happened when Atheists got ahold of power.  In just a few regions in the 20th century alone 150M+ people were murdered at the hands of atheist socialists.  To ignore that\u2019s just proves my point you are a bigot.\nbitee1: Religious beliefs are being constantly forced on others with indoctrination, religious based laws and incessant preaching through media. If believers could completely keep it to themselves, it seems realistic that we would then not care near as much about religion. If there was a way to get through to believers using logic and reason, I would gladly do that instead of primarily mocking faith based ideas. It is the religious moderates who are especially harmful by being the majority who are protecting, enabling and validating the beliefs used for religious harm, even though the moderates do not really think the books have a literal meaning.\n\nTelling people to have faith trains people to accept ideas that are not based on reality. Faith tells believers that just accepting people for their word is a great and noble thing. These things that require faith have no known basis on reality. Just believing everyone or a holy book that does not have supporting evidence for any reason is not a virtue. It is training people to be gullible and setting them up to be easily manipulated. These things that require faith very often contradict scientific facts. These things that require faith many times are harmful like not using condoms because \"they are evil\" it is just a means to propagate the religion at the great expense of the believers.\n\nThere is no debate here, as you love faith and what can only be called by honest people fairy tales. If you had simple logic skills and were allowed to honestly question your religious beliefs you would not have them.\n\nThere is no god that just watches as children are abused and starve to death that is worthy of worship except from cowards, liars the greatly deluded and other psychopathic personalities.\n", "prompt": "herjall: A tree literally older than Jesus\n\nWhirrBuzzer: The tree isn't fictional.\nManJpeg: Religion bad!!1! &gt;:(\nbitee1: It is the religious moderate majority who play a very important role in protecting, enabling and validating the harmful beliefs of the", "orig": "fundamentalists - by this fact they are indirectly harming others.

Judging by your questions on fasteners and whether or not you need a 'wood cutter' I feel that you're destined to pay a lot more than you think for lumber that you're not sure what to do with. \n\nUnless you make this table out of plywood (which could look cool but won't look polished like this) you're likely looking at spending more than if you just bought the table premade. (Esp if you also have to buy tools) Curious, how much does the table cost to buy it outright?\n\nWith that said, I never want to be discouraging. I just know how shitty my first projects came out and I had access to pretty much any tool I needed and real life help from people around me. \n\nYou won't save money by building this yourself. Good luck, OP.\nShadomd: I completely understand! I figured it was worth a try to ask for help regardless. The table is $700 alone, I do have a friend who has certain tools and is willing to help me however he has only built bedframes and beehives from what I know. He hasn't built a table before but he offered to help regardless. Say if I had a table saw, router, drill press, and cut off saw would it make it easier to make?\nLittleJackass80: Absolutely. So let's say you don't really need to buy tools and you just have to get lumber and fasteners. My first step would be looking at what kind of wood I'd want and how I'm going to assemble the top. The other pieces, the legs, aprons, etc, you could use a wood that isn't as nice, but the top matters. This is especially challenging because you want to stain - which hides much less imperfection than paint, so the wood has to be nice to begin with.\n\nAssemble the top sounds like overkill, but you have to consider you won't find a slab of wood that size for a decent price, so you'll be joining some more narrow pieces together to form the wider top. (There are more tools involved here, however let's not consider them for now, let's just focus on the lumber.) Pine or Fir is going to be the cheapest and most available to you in big box stores. It also looks the cheapest and is soft and will easily pick up markings from writing on the table/pressing too hard. There are also more knots and imperfections in this type of wood. If you were going for a rustic or industrial look, I'd say go for it, but this is more finished looking to me.\n\nThis leaves us looking at nicer woods or high grade plywood with edge banding. You can find both of these options at big box stores, however the quality simply isn't what you'd find at a yard or specialty store. (Think lots of warping, wood that's been there for who knows how long, and a lack of knowledge from underpaid and under trained associates.) \n\nThe hardware, stain, sealer, and fasteners wouldn't be a terrible cost, probably around $50, but the lumber is going to sting. Figure out your plan - (btw, look on sites like Ana White for free plans that tells you how much of everything you need,) and take that list to the store and see what the cost is. Plan for waste, up your needed lumber, and see if you feel it's worth it. \n\n(Another option would be to find a table top on another old table and refinish it and just make the base. Craigslist, estate sales, thrift stores, etc.)\n", "prompt": "Shadomd: Need help building this dining room table with a mini bookshelf in it.\n[removed]\nLittleJackass80: I've been woodworking as a hobby for a while now and must be honest and say this might not be the best first time project for you.

No one wants them assuming our opinion for us.

The transparent top admits [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight) and prevents heat escape via [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection) that would otherwise occur, particularly at night. Essentially, a cold frame functions as a miniature [greenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse) to [extend the growing season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_extension).\n\n&gt;Historically cold frames were built to be used in addition to a heated [greenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse). The name itself exemplifies the distinction between the warm greenhouse and the unheated cold frame. They were frequently built as part of the greenhouse's foundation brickwork along the southern wall (in northern latitudes). This allowed seeds to be germinated in the greenhouse and then easily moved to the attached cold frame to be \"hardened-off\"  before final planting outside.  Cold frames are similar to some enclosed [hotbeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotbed_(gardening\\)),  also called hotboxes. The difference is in the amount of heat generated inside. This is parallel to the way that some greenhouses are called \"hothouses\" to emphasize their higher temperature, achieved either by the solar effects alone or by auxiliary heating via a [heater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heater) or [HVAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC) system of some kind.\n\n&gt;Cold frames are found in [home gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_gardens) and in [vegetable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable) farming.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: Twitter\u2019s Lawsuit Against Elon Musk to Get First Hearing on July 19\n[deleted]\nJim63t: Hope this ends with Elon still buying Twitter but at a much  better price. I was actually excited to see him clean house at Twitter and get rid of the censorship.\nBanner80: The expected outcome of this lawsuit is that Musk will eventually settle out of court paying maybe $5 billion to Twitter to make this go away.\n\nI don't know how you missed it, but Musk has been a douchebag about this process throughout, as usual, and he has no leg to stand on legally either. He is at fault and will have to make some sort of offer to get out of this. \n\nAnd that is assuming he didn't sell his Twitter stock at a profit already, which would open the door for manipulation charges. Normally I wouldn't expect anyone to be that stupid, but we are talking about Musk here, he has a habit of thinking the SEC are a joke and testing the theory.\nJim63t: The penalty is 1b in the contract. How do you get to 5b?   4d in slander? Don't see anything really. \n\nBeing a douchebag isn't illegal. Maybe it goes back to not disparaging Twitter in the contract, but like I said I don't see a poop emoji costing Elon that much. \n\nAnd is Twitter really didn't provide the data that Elon requested than I but he walks away free and clear. Now a more interesting discussion is why Twitter is (or may be) hiding the bot count.\nBanner80: &gt;The penalty is 1b in the contract. \n\nThat's the exit fee if there's a material reason why the purchase can't continue. This is why Musk is making a whole display about bots, he is trying to argue that there's a reason why the deal can't continue, so he only has to pay the 1 billion fee.\n\nBut the deal was: 1 billion if there's a material reason stopping the deal (like the SEC intervening or outright fraud), or he has to buy Twitter for the agreed price. Those are the only 2 options. Also, when he signed that deal he agreed that Twitter comes as-is, bots and all and there was no need for a discovery process. So there is no conversation to be had about bots or anything else, Musk had already agreed to buy as-is.\n\nSo to sum up: he agreed to those 2 options, and there's nothing stopping the deal. The bot thing is made up and has no effect on the contract. So Musk has no option but to buy Twitter at the agreed price. But he is going to try to sue to make up a whole thing about bots and whatever other BS he can think of to try to pretend there's a material reason why he can't close the deal. He is going to have his lawyers try to claim fraud.\n\nThis will likely drag for a while, and eventually Musk will offer Twitter enough money to cover the legal expenses and be ok with just letting the whole thing go. Because Musk simply doesn't want to buy Twitter at this stage (probably doesn't have the money, or never wanted to, we don't know the exact reason since he'd just lie).\n\nTwitter on their end can most likely keep pushing this legal battle and win eventually, but it will take years of BS and dragging from Musk, and the outcome would be to have to sell to Musk which is also undesirable. So when Musk makes an offer for a few billion to let it go, Twitter will likely accept to take the profit and be done with this noise, but it's going to have to be for enough to make up for all the BS, they are not going to let it go at 1 billion.\nJim63t: So this contract is far from as-is or a done deal. Looking at section 4.6. Bots go to the very core of Twitter's value. If those numbers are fake (not saying they are) then Elon is probably looking good in sec 8.1. and if the bot numbers are very wrong Twitter is going to have some very mad advertisers and shareholders.  \n\nGoing to be a fun show.\nBanner80: This is Twitter's recent response along with the lawsuit\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312522191300/d370677dex992.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312522191300/d370677dex992.htm)\n\nThey are basically saying that Musk is arguing BS because it is plain to see that he didn't do the good faith efforts to move the process along, which also was a requirement of the agreement and puts him in breach.\n\nWhatever he can make of the bots issue he is trying to push, he has violated the terms of the agreement and the SEC rules so far ([failed to disclose stock purchase](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/13/twitter-investors-sue-elon-musk-for-failing-to-promptly-disclose-stake.html)), in clear display of bad faith. The courts are not going to be impressed with whatever he was to say for himself in dragging this further.\n\nI'd recommend reading this article for more context\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/technology/twitter-lawsuit-musk-acquisition.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/technology/twitter-lawsuit-musk-acquisition.html)\nJim63t:  I expect this from Twitter. \n\nLet's bet a Starbucks coffee on it. \n\nElon buys the company for reduced price or pays &lt;= 1b termination fee, I win.

Mandatory diversity advancements and pro-diversity programs in education can only do so much. Eventually those with disparities will have to actually become self-responsible and learn how to exist without those programs put there to help them. If they don't then they never will actually be able to compete on an equal setting. And the programs put out their to make things pro-diversity will eventually harm the business because they aren't advancing the best employee, they're advancing diversity.\nGhostCheese: That \"eventually\" is decades away,  though,  since the advantages of a biased system will have invested in those that benefit from the bias,  and reflect in their resumes. \n\nAt the beginning the only benefit will be for entry level.\n\nThey would have to practice blinding over an entire career to eliminate the benefits of historical bias.\n\nOr perhaps use a completely different way of evaluating candidates that reduces historical biases.\n\n \nduganaok: There have already been instances in the military where advancing someone for diversity instead of qualifications have costed individual lives including the one advanced. And I can think of one over a decade ago.\nGhostCheese: How does one even determine that a different choice would have been better or worse? \n\nSeems like you are just denigrating the fallen.\nduganaok: I assure you it's no joke.\n\nKara Spears Hultgreen\n\nIt was wildly speculated that she died because the Navy was in a race with the Air Force for a female pilot. Things she failed in flight school, that would have cost the dreams of any male pilot had they made the same mistakes, and she was advanced anyways. And when she crashed it was around the same reasons she failed flight school. She should have never been a pilot. I'm not saying a female can't become a fighter pilot, but she was promoted specifically cause she was a women and died because of it.\n\nIt really is a bad idea for the military to not promote just on merit. You don't want someone leading because they are an ethnic minority or a certain gender. You want that person in a higher position because they are the best person for the job.\n\nThere are men who don't get promoted even though they are qualified, and there are minorities that get promoted even though they are not qualified. It's bad policy and, from a military standpoint, unsustainable. Eventually the military will concede.\nGhostCheese: &gt; An Accuracy in Media reports others quoting CDR Tom Sobiek, commanding officer of Fighter Squadron VF-124, as saying of the four female pilots in his squadron, \"the women are going to graduate regardless of how they performed\" and that \"the Navy was in a race with the Air Force to get the first female fighter pilot\". **It quotes Sobiek denying making any such statement. \"That is a flat \\*\\*\\*\\* lie,\" he said**. \"And whoever told you that, if they were under oath, should be taken to task.\"\n\nemphasis is my own. in an era of fabricated news, that point is certainly questionable - and without it the whole argument falls apart. If its just a narrative constructed to bolster the male-dominated status quo in the military, then it was successful, at least with you.\n\nmaybe she shouldn't have been advanced, but having served I can tell you theres more than just affirmitive action behind trainers pencil whipping people through.\nduganaok: Yeah, they say that, but she still failed flight school and was commissioned anyways. You can't fail flight school and expect to become a fighter pilot.\nGhostCheese: I know many a soldier who wouldn't have been soldiers had their trainers not pencil whipped them through, and they weren't female, so we can't be sure that the narrative is entirely accurate - and we should be doubly suspicious of such narratives when they support our confirmation bias.\nduganaok: Failing flight school is a career killer. You have to understand. These people don't make it in if they don't have 20/20 vision. They definitely don't make it in if they don't meet training qualifications. It's a multimillion dollar aircraft. The only way I could understand that they would give her wings is political motivation. She did not meet minimum qualifications. There have been men before who were not allowed to fly for less. And you most certainly can't pull the same bullshit again. Because since then nobody that has failed flight training has become a fighter pilot. \nGhostCheese: &gt; The only way I could understand that they would give her wings is political motivation.\n\ntheres the bias though.\nduganaok: She experienced bias in her favor. You don't fail that school and still become a pilot. She did. It cannot be denied.\nGhostCheese: No I mean that you cant imagine any other circumstance, that's your bias. She may have benefited from some bias as well but thats not the context in which I was using the word. \n\nThere's a problem too that people that get through flight school despite problems,  but who then don't have an accident,  those cases go unreported.

You could literally put your feet under your bed frame if you\u2019re worried about scooting or moving while your doing crunches/ab workouts\neggplant_avenger: &gt;rely on your legs to pull your body up\n\nOP did say they wanted it for Nordic curls :P\nPurpLLs: Either way, I\u2019m not trusting a \u201csuction cup\u201d so I can face plant. You\u2019re better off using your Olympic barbell with 200lbs. \n\nIf OP wants to all I have to say is - Good luck and let us know how that workouts for ya!\nKhorneBerserker: Hate to see solid advice getting downvoted like this.\nIf you don't own solid equipment save money until you do or stfu.\nEnvy and whining solves nothing and is just petty. OP did not even boast or anything likr that. If you want to faceplant while doing Nordic curls because you to lazy to invest in a corner mounted pullup bar or use proper equipment, be my guest but don't think that entitles you to not beeing called out for your dumb idea using crappy unneccessary equipment.\nImportantManNumber2: Except that this is bodyweight fitness, you shouldn't expect people in this sub to have weights because otherwise they would be posting in fitness.\n\nSuggest a better piece of equipment maybe as you have with a corner mounted pull up bar, but asking someone to invest in a Olympic barbell with 200lbs in bodyweight fitness is not helpful at all.\nKhorneBerserker: Except ecen the FAQ or RR recommends you squat using weights. Its this senseless cult behaviour that makes you so narrow minded. Also screwing in a pipe into a corner or wall is notvrocket science. Supporting garbage plastic products which is basically trash from the get go is Environmentally unfriendly and shoul not be encouraged. That whole product screams Teleshopping ab blaster 3000 and should not in any way shape or form be supported by a Community as science driven an reasonable as bodyweightfitess normally is. I did not Trash talk OP I just think it is important that I informed them and other people, that Equipment Like this is utter garbage.\nImportantManNumber2: I'm not completely against the idea of using weights I'm not part of any cult mentality, I was just offering an opinion on why the guy was getting downvoted.\n\nHowever there is a difference between using some weights for squats maybe some curls as dumbbells and an Olympic style barbell. Dumbbells are small, convenient, cheap and easy to store, a barbell isn't. The Barbell has its uses and is a very good piece of equipment, but the reason most people are on bodyweight fitness is because they either can't afford the full kits or don't have the storage capacity. I used to have a good barbell but I had to get rid of it when I moved house because I had nowhere to put it. \n\nAlso screwing a pipe into a wall might not be the easiest if you don't own the house, a lot of landlords won't let you have any fixtures, heck I've even known some that don't let their tenants hang pictures on the walls!\n\nI do agree with you that the product in the post looks like garbage and teleshopping equipment isn't worth it and shouldn't be encouraged.\n", "prompt": "rjaguila8: Has anyone here used a floor suction sit-up bar?\nI\u2019m looking to buy one of these floor suction sit-up bars (Flyfan Portable Floor Sit Up Bar, Super Strong Suction Sit Up Assistant Device with 2 Suction Cups, Abs Master Pro Easy for Abdominal Training", "orig": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BNR4ZGK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_ZR8P99FCAZR670JZ26KD)\n\nI want to use it for Nordic curls but I\u2019m skeptical that they work.

Over the last 60 years all pipelines have either required greater capacity or they've fallen out of use. Its like roads or railways. That's leaving about 20% of their pipelines in the \"wait till it fails\" state. Its a method of upkeep - not a sensible one but they have no other options.\nTheLiberalOgre: I know I work in the USA.\n\nAbout 40% are unused/ empty because there was a push prepandemic to build them. So they're not being maintained because of that. Plus Trump Era rules (and before too) allowed them to be built pretty crappily so you get tons of spills and shit.\n\nOne of the refineries I work at got around the problem by building a pretty awesome rail shipment system. \n\nSo nah, this ruling is a good thing. We need to stop building willy nilly and focus on better upkeep and use of existing infrastructure.\nbloonail: Rail and trucks systems are more than 130 times more accident prone than pipelines by volume (according to even casual searches). But the pipelines have problems, \"More than half of the nation's pipelines are at least 50 years old. Last year in Allentown Pa., a natural gas pipeline exploded underneath a city street, killing five people who lived in the houses above and igniting a fire that damaged 50 buildings. The pipeline \u2013 made of cast iron \u2013 had been installed in 1928.\"\nTheLiberalOgre: For spill, rail is safer than pipeline. \n\nAnd the example you gave proves my point.\n\nThat's a pipeline replacement project.

This tactic is actually putting about 50,000 lives at risk every year,  blocks employment and makes everything cost more.\nTheLiberalOgre: Yeah, it is safer. You can look it up if you want. It's largely because of deregulation that's led to shoddy workmanship and management. \n\nRail has a higher rate of human injury, that's where it loses out.\n\nWhatever dude, I only work in the fucking industry.

Blackstrap had 3 accidents and 4 deaths. So maybe 27% of the blasting workforce in the mountain across the valley had died in 2 years. Blackstrap and Whistler are actually the same outfit although to be fair they were run semi-independent for a long while. Then just two mountains in one ski area. There was nothing on earth that would convince him his accident rate was high. For those curious the most dangerous thing they'd done was to put little fins on their shells to guide them more accurately. The fins got caught in the launch tube. That wasn't resolved quickly.

One of the people I was hanging out with was a guy I met a couple of times. He was not very nice, but not openly rude.\n\nThis time he kind of told me without me doing anything particular that \"I should fuck off\"/ \"nobody likes me here\" and \"I should leave\", that \"he really dislikes me\" and \"doesn't want to see my face\". Additionally he said nobody at the place there likes me, which I don't think is true.\n\nGenerally I'm an easy going person and really really rarely I meet people who don't like me. Almost never I met somebody who is that rude, so I was dumbfounded about what to do. He lives right in my neighbourhood and chances are I'll meet him when shopping for groceries etc.\n\nHow would you deal with that situation and person in the future? :/\nAlbertsson01: Ask everyone there very loudly if it\u2019s true that they all don\u2019t like you, telling them that this is what he just said to you.\n\nIf they don\u2019t all condemn him and and defend you, you\u2019re indeed hanging out with the wrong crowd. I\u2019m sure they would though.\nPretend-Nerve8357: This usually backfires \nWhat if the crowd actually likes the guy that hates you?\nAlbertsson01: You\u2019re right that this could happen if your position in the hierarchy of the group is low due to e.g. not being a very confident person, which can lead to the others in the group not respecting you. \n\nIf you\u2019re generally a confident person and well respected, it won\u2019t happen to you. So I don\u2019t agree at all, that this \u201cusually backfires\u201d.\n\nBut even if lack of respect is part of the reason the others in the group don\u2019t back you up, it\u2019s still a profoundly shitty thing to side with someone who is so mean and immature.\n\nSo either way it\u2019d be a reason to look for new people.\nPretend-Nerve8357: \u201cWell respected\u201d is very subjective though \n\nHard to quantify\nBeing confident has little to do with it too, OP could be a confident prick, you don\u2019t know\nAlbertsson01: I\u2019m talking about the natural social dominance hierarchy, which is part of every group of people that gets together (I know people don\u2019t like admitting this, but anthropological literature backs this up).\n\nThe dominance hierarchy has no direct relation to any moral values, so that even a prick can occupy a higher position in the hierarchy.\n\nThe hierarchy is indirectly related to moral values in the way that in a group that shares and actively supports \u201cgood\u201d moral values, a prick would likely get kicked out of the group.\n\nIf you ask an anthropologist trained in human behaviorism to watch a video of a group interaction, he\u2019ll be able to easily break down which hierarchical relations are present in the group. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s really subjective.\n\nAnd confidence is definitely a defining factor when it comes to how you will behave in the group, how you react to others \u201ctesting\u201d your position in the hierarchy etc., thus greatly influencing your position in the hierarchy as well as wether or not you will be able to maintain the position.\nPretend-Nerve8357: Wow, we got a Jordan Peterson fanatic over here\nSo many buzzwords being used without a clear understanding of each of the words \n\nPlease throw in \u201clobsters\u201d and \u201cPareto principle\u201d next time \nIt\u2019ll give more oomph without adding actual substance to your argument\nAlbertsson01: Nothing to do with Jordan Peterson. Just read one anthropological book on this topic and you should be able to get up to speed.\n\nBut funny how the word \u201chierarchy\u201d or \u201cdominance hierarchy\u201d immediately gets people like you triggered.\n\nJordan Peterson didn\u2019t invent any of these concepts.\nPretend-Nerve8357: Your comment sounded like a copy pasta edit of a Peterson lecture \nIt was hilarious\nAlbertsson01: I don\u2019t think Peterson talks about human social group behavior, at least I\u2019ve never seen it.\n\nI\u2019m aware that he talks about dominance hierarchies in a more broader sense of societal structures and that he advocates \u201cclimbing up\u201d these hierarchical institutions.\n\nWhat we\u2019re talking about here is completely different. We\u2019re talking about direct human to human contact in a small social group.\n\nStill seems to me like you were just triggered by the word dominance hierarchy.\nPretend-Nerve8357: Haha you\u2019re the one that posted that long manifesto earlier\nNews flash : No one askedz \n\nI\u2019ll call a spade a spade. You are a spade \nYour ideas are rooted in Peterson philosophies. I\u2019m surprised you are that old and no one told you. I\u2019m sad that you went your entire life and no idea how blind you were. \nBut again, it\u2019s ok. You sound 80. It\u2019s almost over.

Please see a therapist. Get help. You are 37.\nAlbertsson01: My thinking? I presented a specific scientific concept. It has nothing to do with Peterson\u2019s statements on dominance hierarchies. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know where \u201cfallacies\u201d come in. It\u2019s literally just a concept.\nPretend-Nerve8357: Here take an upvote . \nAs a 17 year old, I feel nothing but pity for you. \nWhat a sad life you must lead to let a teenager troll you \nHahahahhahahahahahaha\nAlbertsson01: More like what a sad teenager you are.

{"full_text": "Agile-Shine4302: Calisthenics Carryover to Weightlifting\nG'Morning BWF, this post is about my experience from starting weightlifting after a year of calisthenics, as well as why I personally believe people should start with calisthenics first, and then do weightlifting.\nI started calisthenics late 2020 but took it seriously In 2021.  Around 7 July 2021 I was 65kg 183cm and couldn't do 1 dip or pull up \nFast forward to now I can do at least 15 dips and 10 pull ups, hold an L Sit for about 4 secs \nCan do Tuck Lever,frog stand and skin the cat. Essentially early progressions. But what I found interesting or what the base of this post is, is that I bench pressed for the first time 3 months ago and wasn't consistent with it. I could barely do the bar as I was shaking alot, I eventually got 65 kg but now after 1 month and half consistently doing it I've found that I've increased it to 80 kg . My current stats are 183 cm 83 kg \n I'm not too sure if that's normal but I believe going into calisthenics first is the best, cause you'll come out of it with a base in calisthenics strength and probably be able to pick up some neat tricks along the way. Also you can carry over the strength into weightlifting\nTankTopBro-1992: Nah, weightlifting should be your first approach. Calisthenics did nothing for my actual strength so had no real carry over to weights. But after lifting for a year I was much much at chin ups, pull ups and push ups. Plus way bigger than I ever was when I was doing calisthenics. Frankly if you just want strength and muscle you do weight lifting. The only benifits I see from doing calisthenics is that you can do calisthenics moves, and no one really cares if you can do pull ups or levers, but if you have 16\" or 17\" arms lean then most people give you glances.\nAgile-Shine4302: I'd say that's relative to your goals - aesthetics,functionality and or strength\nI personally feel that beginners should pick up functionality and strength first. 10 pull ups is impressive if you can do that you'd probably fare well in its counterpart of lat pull downs\nDips are dips i guess, that benefits bench press as well. Regardless I don't think people should chase aesthetics purely\nTankTopBro-1992: Functionality is what people who can't pick up heavy weights use to justify not being able to pick up heavy weights. There has never been a single case in my life where something I needed to do depended on me being able to do a pull up. Beginners should start with weights, the standard exercises are easier to learn, easier to progressively overload and don't fluctuate like your bodyweight. People get a real hard on from trying to prove calisthenics is as good as weights when it comes to actual results and it's just not the case. If you want to do calisthenics the. Great, but pretending like they are the equivalent of a good weight lifting program just makes you seem inexperienced or dishonest or both. Enjoy that hit of reality, ba bye \ud83e\udd19\nrokdukakis: Yeah man pushups and pullups are so hard to learn /s\n\nThere's never been a single case in my life where I needed to squat 500 lbs for one rep (yet I have done this in a PL meet, belt and sleeves, 3 whites). Most real world activities require strength-endurance with rarely much more than your body weight. Having extra strength capacity is cool and great, but it generally comes at expense of other areas. Everything is a tradeoff.\n\nThe key is that calisthenics can build muscle and muscle transfers to everything. Will that muscle be immediately trained for heavy 1RMs, no. It will be trained for decent relative strength to your bodyweight with endurance, mobility and conditioning built-in. \n\nPeople get a hard on from beginner lifting programs that basically extract easy newb gains and CNS adaptations. Then they believe this is the Only Way. Time to permabulk and maximize strength at the expense of everything else.\nTankTopBro-1992: Sorry, didn't read your novel kiddo. I got though the first sentence and realised you had to dumb down your argument to \"push ups and pull ups make up enough of the bulk when it comes to bodyweight that I can build an opening case with that\". Wrong, have fun coping, enjoy the rest of your day, ta ta \ud83d\ude18\nAgile-Shine4302: I don't know why nor do I really care , but why have you felt the need to project whatever insecurities you have to other people? There's no  need for such attitude and In all honesty it's cringe. Stop it, get some help\nTankTopBro-1992: Assuming people are projecting is projecting kiddo.

These outrageous shifts of profit from worker compensation or consumer rewards into shareholder compensation -- that is consistent with a singular moral perspective.  \n\nIf you aren't bright enough to at least weigh competing moral perspectives, you have no business in any sort of leadership role.  The new executive has no time for altruism except as an element of public relations and marketing.  What will get you top marks at Harvard Business School is also what will define you as an inhumane savage if you ever get your hands on any actual reigns of power.  \n\nIt isn't that shareholders deserve no respect (though private profit from mere passive ownership of the means of production is an outrageously counterproductive way for any society to divide up any significant portion of its newly generated wealth), but that even with capitalist assumptions, there are other competing values also worthy of consideration -- consideration that runs contrary to the modern claptrap that passes for \"business ethics.\"\nCycad: I can clearly remember when my Dad was retired in the early 90s that he said accountants were destroying his industry.

It has been easier to increase profits by juggling debt and finances than to invest in research and products. Hence its become a self perpetuating cycle.\n\nAnd in terms of warping morality, we are at the sharp end here in London where its virtually impossible now to have a comfortable lifestyle without access to an outsized financial sector salary, which sucks talent away from productive jobs in another self perpetuating cycle. \nthebabaghanoush: &gt; This was due to all the top positions going to finance guys not people who had come up with hands on experience of the industry.\n\nI work for a very small software company that refuses to take outside funding.

Well, now it's time for a philosopher to fight back. And put the case for why Coyne's arguments don't stack up\n\nireedthingz: Pigliucci examined Coyne's arguments, but he did not actually say anything to prove them wrong. As far as I'm concerned, Coyne's conclusion still stands. Ultimately, the human body is a massive complex machine. Our brain is made of atoms that respond to physical stimuli. \nConsider the following: When you drink alcohol, the alcohol effects the molecules in your brain. As a result, you become drunk. Doesn't being drunk affect your \"free will\"? Consciousness is all in the brain. \nIf there is a factor called \"free will\" that affects your decisions, then where does it come from? Your own brain? But the brain is just a machine. I still think that free will is nothing more than our conscious experience of complex chemical reactions in the brain.\nTLDR: free will doesn't exist; it's all in your head.\n[deleted]: Except Coyne's conclusion is bullshit because he can't explain how the brain works.\n[deleted]: He doesn't need to.\n[deleted]: Then he hasn't proven anything.\n[deleted]: You haven't explained your logic. Your point may make sense in your head, but it doesn't follow obviously from your premise. Explain it, please; so far you're just making declarative statements.\n[deleted]: You can't make a final determination about the operation of any thing with out understanding how it works from the most basic level all the way up. We don't know exactly how a brain works so how can we tell if it deterministic?  You can't.  Does this really need to be explained? It's really simple logic that most humans should just \"get\". \n\nfrom the article:\n\n&gt;Jerry\u2019s position on free will is not scientific (it is a metaphysical stance), and his two \u201clines of evidence\u201d are lacking [...] because of his misreading of the neurobiological literature.\n\nHe reads about how little bits of the brain work in neural chemical mechanical ways and makes a determination that the entire structure is similar.  That's like saying that since the hard drive in a computer spins in circles that a computer is simply a series of gears.  \n[deleted]: You can also see a long system of pulleys with a single rope with a weight at the end and know that if you pull the rope the weight will move either up or down without knowing the position and size of every pulley. The brain consists of glial cells and neurons; signal conduction is robust, reliable, and entirely determined by its current state and its input. It's enough to know its deterministic.\n\nThat doesn't mean we can draw a big diagram of it or predict what it will do, but it does suggest that it is deterministic.\n\nYou're working off of intuition, not rigor or formalism, hence my comment that it makes sense in your head but perhaps not in everyone else's. For the record, employing a bit more humility goes a long way towards inspiring discussion instead of drawing criticism.\n\n&gt;Does this really need to be explained?\n\nYes, it does; don't be an ass.\n[deleted]: Working off of intuition is acceptable on an internet forum, it's not acceptable as *proof* for or against free will.  \n[deleted]: Fine, if you just wanted someplace to spill out your intuition and didn't want to have a serious discussion, then I won't waste my time.\n\nFor the record, I'm open to my ideas being wrong if it can be satisfactorily demonstrated; I meant that you're obviously not going to take the effort, so I won't take the effort either.\n\nHow disappointing.\n[deleted]: Sorry, I don't have the time or inclination to teach you logic. I thought pointing out that this Coyne is not using it would be enough. If you want more proof than that, RTFA.\n\n&gt;In a \"causal\" chain A-&gt;B-&gt;C (with an \"if and only if relation - \"B\" occurs if and only if\n\"A\" occurs) we can predict \"C\" from \"A\". But if (like the square root function) A can result not only in \"B\" but also in \"B'\" (B prime), then B'-&gt;C'-&gt;D'-&gt;etc. and the train heads West instead of East! \n[deleted]: Insults don't mean much when they come from unintellectuals.\n[deleted]: What insult?\n[deleted]: &gt;Sorry, I don't have the time or inclination to teach you logic.\n\nIf you really didn't know what I was talking about and that the above quote is insulting, then that's another case of your not thinking before posting.\n[deleted]: I'm not completely responsible for your state of mind.\n", "prompt": "DrRichardCranium: On Free Will --- \n\n\nEvolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne recently argued that free will does not exist.

I would personally be in favor of breaking Google up into non-profit (to serve organic results) and for-profit (for advertising) entities.\neleitl: It is possible to obtain Google-like capabilities with an open source P2P search engine. It wouldn't even necessarily be even slow, especially if symmetric domestic broadband is developing, and personal cloud computing can be rented for very little money.\nZorbaTHut: Speaking as someone who used to work at Google, I find this *extremely* questionable. The Google engine is a horrifyingly complex beast that throws a huge amount of data around, and that's something P2P is extremely bad at.\n\n(yes yes, \"but bittorrent throws a lot of data around!\", no it doesn't, I'm talking about saturating gigabit ethernet ports on every one of thousands of computers. Bittorrent can't do that because people don't have anywhere near that much internet connection available.)\neleitl: &gt; Speaking as someone who used to work at Google, I find this extremely questionable. \n\nIt is currently only possible if a lot of people rent out a lot of servers all over the world, and use these to index and to process queries. The local node instance on residential broadband would just have a few GBytes worth of full text index, and contact the nearest node(s) who further farm out the query, with the asker being the gather point.\n\n&gt; and that's something P2P is extremely bad at.\n\nP2P is good for a distributed web crawler. The current infrastructure would prefer the bulk of the query processing to be done by machines on high-bandwidth, low-latency links which are close to the backbone while distributed all over the world. \n\nThere are two gigapeople who are online. \n\n&gt; Bittorrent can't do that because people don't have anywhere near that much internet connection available.)\n\nIn principle there's no reason why not a few millions of people wouldn't be on GBit Ethernet in a local (city-wide) mesh topology within less than a decade.\nZorbaTHut: I think you're dramatically underestimating the amount of data that Google deals with. Google isn't a full-text search engine. Those died with Hotbot. Google does vastly more complicated processes - even Pagerank is a good example of that - some of which require *vastly* more data and processing than a simple full-text search engine does.\n\nInternet connections aren't low latency compared to what Google requires for its current performance.\neleitl: &gt; I think you're dramatically underestimating the amount of data that Google deals with.\n\nWith two billion Internet users, 0.01% of these installing software on infrastructure they control will outclass all the hardware in Google's datacenters by CPU and by disk storage.\n\nNot by intermediate bandwidth. Not yet.\n\n&gt; Google isn't a full-text search engine. \n\nWhat most people need is a decently ranking full text search engine, with an up-to-date index. This can be done in a P2P fashion, especially in the future where residential connections have particular bandwidth/latency and local loop topologies.\n\n&gt; Google does vastly more complicated processes\n\nI think you're injecting unnecessary mystique into the process.\n\n&gt; even Pagerank\n\nPagerank (which is not what they currently use) is a trivial algorithm.\n\n&gt; some of which require vastly more data and processing than a simple full-text search engine does.\n\nI'm not interested in replicating Google. I'm only interested in an open source P2P search engine that doesn't care about serving ads and offers similar indexing scope and recency.\n\n&gt; Internet connections\n\nI have microsecond latency within the datacenter. There's no reason why residential mesh would come close to that, on the local loop.\n\n&gt;  for its current performance.\n\nWe do not want to clone Google. We want to have a decent search engine.\nZorbaTHut: &gt; 0.01% of these installing software on infrastructure they control will outclass all the hardware in Google's datacenters by CPU and by disk storage.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that this isn't enough. Modern distributed computing systems care surprisingly little about CPU and disk. The important bits tend to be the huge working sets that need to be accessed with low latency. Generally we're talking about working sets that flat-out cannot fit in RAM, and curiously, we've *always* been talking about that - the working sets tend to expand at the same rate as RAM does.\n\nThen we end up comparing datacenter networks that can throw gigabits of data around with millisecond/microsecond latency versus residential networks that flat-out can't - and, again, this isn't a situation where the residential networks will catch up, this is a situation where they're both advancing at roughly the same rate - and the residential networks will always be inferior.\n\n&gt; I think you're injecting unnecessary mystique into the process.\n\nI apologize, I'm still under NDA for a lot of stuff and I'm having to explain why I think this wouldn't work without giving any real numbers or figures :)\n\n&gt; We do not want to clone Google. We want to have a decent search engine.\n\nA \"decent search engine\" implies certain things, like search quality equal or greater to that of Google, and spam prevention. I don't think you can achieve that with a residential network. At least without *far* more coding genius than Google can harness.\n\nAnd I'm not convinced that any open-source project can harness that much coding genius. :)\neleitl: &gt; Modern distributed computing systems care surprisingly little about CPU and disk\n\nNot so very modern. (I used to be in the Beowulf FAQ, through no fault of my own).\n\n&gt; The important bits tend to be the huge working sets that need to be accessed with low latency\n\nIn case of querying a large distributed index you need scatter/gather kind of traffic, which can be adequately handled by topology-aware supernodes.\n\n&gt; Then we end up comparing datacenter networks that can throw gigabits of data around with millisecond/microsecond latency\n\nIt is pretty easy and cheap to rent nodes within such, especially using cloud abstractions. And if you really have a million systems, some of them will wind up in the same datacenter. This is pretty common with such sparse networks as Tor already. Usually there aren't that many data centers with good connectivity and affordability.\n\n&gt; and the residential networks will always be inferior.\n\nI don't see how a switched optical local loop network would be much different from a few nodes sharing the same datacenter. And of course we're talking about \"good enough\". A topology-aware network with a few ten thousands distributed nodes would be quite enough for its user base. We're not trying to replicate Google, we're trying to build a search engine which is sufficiently fast and has a sufficiently large scope.\n\n&gt; I apologize, I'm still under NDA for a lot of stuff \n\nI understand that -- there's however enough leaks about how Google does things, and how Google *can* do things, as they do not have access to magical hardware, only commodity/nearline hardware scaled very big. This has been done with computational commodity cluster people, which resulted in similar solutions, and at times superior solutions.\n\n&gt; like search quality equal or greater to that of Google\n\nYou can start with search rank, and actually do end user nodes rank results, with reputation tracking and graph mining to detect and nuke circular reputation clusters attempting to game ranking.\n\n&gt; I don't think you can achieve that with a residential network.\n\nRight now you could probably have enough colo nodes so that residential will be only 10:1 or maybe 100:1, so colo nodes act as supernodes for residential nodes. Sure, you will need lots of diagnostics and discovery traffic.\n\n&gt; At least without far more coding genius \n\nThere are 7 billion people on this planet, of these 2 billion are online. While open source projects do not necessarily result in excellence by itself, there are open source project which resulted in excellence. I think a good P2P search engine would draw sufficient talent, with time. As you mentioned, it's a hard problem do it right.\n\n&gt; And I'm not convinced that any open-source project can harness that much coding genius. :)\n\nI agree. A lot of open source projects are crap. But not all of them are.\n\n\nZorbaTHut: &gt; In case of querying a large distributed index you need scatter/gather kind of traffic, which can be adequately handled by topology-aware supernodes.\n\nNote that I'm not just talking about the index, I'm talking about the ranking parts as well. The index is relatively simple (still really nasty due to the scale involved, but *relatively* simple.) The hard part is generating the information about what pages are \"good\" and what pages are \"bad\" and what pages are spam.\n\nThat's where those giant gigabit interconnects come in real, real handy.\n\n&gt; I don't see how a switched optical local loop network would be much different from a few nodes sharing the same datacenter.\n\nDistance and quantity. When Google has a few nodes sharing the same datacenter, that's a hundred thousand nodes. Residential networks are going to have, like, a few dozen nodes at best on the same area.\n\nAnd they'll be separated by miles instead of meters. That stuff adds up.\n\n&gt; We're not trying to replicate Google, we're trying to build a search engine which is sufficiently fast and has a sufficiently large scope.\n\nThe problem is that I think you *have* to replicate Google for this, otherwise people just use Google :)\n\nAnd you get a whole host of problems if you succeed, note. Any big search engine is vulnerable to its own success - as soon as you're big, you become a fucking *huge* target for spammers, which makes your job easily an order of magnitude harder.\n\n&gt; I think a good P2P search engine would draw sufficient talent, with time. As you mentioned, it's a hard problem do it right.\n\nI'm just not convinced by this, unfortunately. For a project of this scope you need a *lot* of brilliant people working together. That's something OSS is unfortunately bad at - with the exception of the corporate-backed projects, even the flagships of the OSS world have at most a small handful of really good people on them.\n\nI mean, look at it this way. You're talking about finding a small number of people who could replicate Google on distributed commodity hardware for cheap. Sure, they *could* give that software away for free, but how many people wouldn't choose to sell it instead?\n\n(And then look at the fact that nobody's done it yet, and that should be a sign that the problem is really horrifyingly difficult.)\n\nNote that I'm not saying OSS = crap. Far from it, there's some great OSS projects out there. But I think the economics that make the big OSS projects work are economics that kind of fall flat when you're talking about a single unified distributed-computing effort like this.\n", "prompt": "fregoli: Google is polluting the internet\n\noptiontrader1138: A complicated question, to be sure.

Mixed fabrics, unclean skin of pigs, murdering adulterers, essentially the entirety of Leviticus is stuff that doesn\u2019t fly these days. The bible regularly contradicts itself as well, so it is literally impossible to be a Christian that follows everything within it. Singling out gay Christians as potential hypocrites is flawed imo, you should question every Christian as rigorously if you follow the same logic.\nFiggywurmacl: Yup I completely agree and think it's ridiculous too.\nBrockStar92: That\u2019s not what I was trying to say. I meant it\u2019s completely ok to be a Christian and accept the bible is a flawed and confusing book, Christianity does not mean \u201ctreat the bible as gospel\u201d (pun fully intended). It\u2019s not hypocritical to believe in god and try to live what you understand to be a Christian life and accept that human understanding of morality has advanced in 2000 years and what was written in the bible as moral at the time no longer applies. \n\nI\u2019m an atheist btw.\nFiggywurmacl: I disagree.

You can\u2019t say \u201cthat\u2019s not what Christianity is\u201d to the POPE then say \u201cwhy do I care what you think\u201d.

That's a very strong word.\n\nAgain, if we throw out half the rules of chess can we still say we're playing chess? Does everyone individually get to pick which parts of the book apply to them? Because that defeats the whole point of a religion.\n\nHow about instead of telling me how I feel about religion you address even one of the points I've made.\nBrockStar92: The \u201cpoints\u201d you\u2019ve made are irrelevant. This isn\u2019t chess, it\u2019s not a game, there\u2019s no winners or losers. Religion is a spiritual matter.

You're just being obtuse and insulting because you can't make a single point.\n\nYou have - take your ball home and cry because you're losing the game - energy.\nBrockStar92: There are no rules, it\u2019s spirituality. How you have faith is your own business. I can call myself a Christian and belief that the bible was divinely sent from god, or I could believe it\u2019s a collection of texts written by flawed humans trying to understand god and either would be an acceptable way to be Christian. People would argue about it but nobody would be \u201cright\u201d because fundamentally religion is built on faith more than scripture and rules.\nFiggywurmacl: That's cool man. I can call myself a chess player during a game of monopoly too.\nBrockStar92: You really can\u2019t get your head around how religion is not a board game. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to explain that to someone today. Fuck me there are some thickos on Reddit.\nFiggywurmacl: Ya some people are so thick they don't know what an analogy is. It's wild out there.\nBrockStar92: It\u2019s a completely redundant and irrelevant analogy. Might as well use baking as an analogy for moral philosophy.

Thanks in advance.\nFL-Irish: Re: the old friends, the whole hard drugs/alcoholic scene are pretty toxic in general, and extremely bad for young families, so if they're heading in that direction you need to REALLY limit how often you see these friends. (as you have with the one who's on drugs) Maybe be there for them in a pinch, but it doesn't even sound like you're enjoying hanging out with the alcoholic one. I don't think you're judging them as human beings. I think you're just protecting your normal life from stuff that has the potential to drag you down. \n\nSo moving on, it's hard to assess your situation. You say a few things have fallen through -- that's pretty common in the adult world, honestly, where everyone is busy with life. So, to go from that to a possible idea of being \"bipolar?\" That's quite the jump! Do you have any reason to suspect mental health issues? If so, it might be worth making a one-off appointment with a counselor just to discuss that. Anyway, hard to judge from what you've said. \n\nSo I'd continue to reach out to the acquaintances. Something like, \"Hey, the wife and I are considering doing X this weekend. Any chance you guys would like to join us?\"\n\nIf the answer is they can't, then just say, \"No problem, maybe some other time!\" Keep the energy and enthusiasm level high. You don't want to be giving off negative or disappointed vibes. Check in by text at least once a week.\n\nAt the same, don't invest all your eggs in this one social basket. If there are other couples who have potential, make it a habit to reach out and mention potential things you could do together. A picnic. A show. A barbecue. Go out for dinner. A movie. A farmers market. Go to the gym or the dog park. Hit a garage sale. \n\nIt's easier to make friends when you've got more than one thing going on, and you can issue casual invitations that don't seem high pressure. \"Oh, we're doing this if you're interested. Let us know!\"\n\nDon't get discouraged. I think you're on the right track. Good luck!\nHighlightSame7499: Thank you soooo much for this. I really needed it.

{"full_text": "akosgi: Truth be told: You probably have ego problems.\nYep, even you.\n\nA common misconception is that having a big ego is reserved for people who think highly of themselves. Sure, they have big egos, but believe it or not, your self-loathing-ass probably does too.\n\nThe concept I'm trying to convey here is when you fill your own head with thoughts of yourself constantly, be them negative or positive, it all constitutes a big ego. Over time, you create this self-image that you become tied to, and thus, it becomes fragile. And, due to this big fragile ego, you refuse to take the actions necessary to get outcomes you desire, because your head is so over-inflated with thoughts of yourself that you aren't giving your thought space the necessary room to interact with and understand the rest of the world. Your subconscious is terrified of anything that can challenge this fragile ego, and so you freak out at the thought of stepping outside your comfort zone and putting yourself out there.\n\nCouple points:\n\n- You're not that important. The only person thinking so much about you is YOU. And the more you think about yourself and how you suck at social skills, are ugly, are afraid of rejection, are this/that, the less you can think about the people around you who you actually WANT to interact with. (disclaimer: because I know some pedant in the comments is gonna bring this up: this isn't targeting those who genuinely DON'T want to interact with others. But seriously, why are y'all on /r/socialskills if your goal isn't to interact with others?)\n\n- When you switch your perspective to learning about and understanding the people and world around you - even in ways that it doesn't affect you - you'll see a profound change in the way you exist. Sure, you'll get rejected. But you'll realize that *it doesn't fucking matter.* You're not so important that this rejection is the end of some great value you brought to the table. \n\n- Approach the world seeking to learn from it and contribute to it. If you have nothing to contribute, learn. If you have nothing to learn, contribute. If you have both, do both.\n\n**TLDR:** The long and short of it is that the more you think about yourself, whether it's good or bad thoughts, the less you're thinking about others and the world around you. I hope this helps some people get over social hurdles that they constructed themselves.\n\n*edit:* Wanted to add a section about actually changing these things. Whenever I feel like something is \"easier said than done,\" or \"hard bc I've been this way all along,\" I call upon a very simple concept: discipline. As I stated in a comment, discipline is doing something that sucks, but you know is good for you, even when you don't want to. And \"not having discipline\" is a cop-out, since it literally is just doing things when you don't want to. There is no great chasm between zero and one. Do or do not, there is no try. You'll never get it if you don't start it, and you'll never have it if you don't keep at it. So discipline yourself to stop your spiraling negative thought processes - meditate, learn to harness your mind and stop letting negative thoughts fill your head. Discipline yourself to go to the gym even when you're tired as shit. Discipline yourself to go and talk to the person you're nervous to talk to, even when you don't want to. Just do it. There's no rocket science here, it's just a matter of doing until it becomes habit. Good luck!\nSunkenStone: I've seen this concept of 'the self-loathing are actually secret narcissists' increasingly frequently, and, since you seem to have bought into it hard, you're as good a person as any to ask: What good comes from this framing? Is it intended to spur the self-loathing into action by adding another item to their list of flaws? Is its purpose to justify those who reject the self-loathing by saying, 'It's okay, they were a narcissist anyway.' Who benefits?\nakosgi: The point is this ego discussion is a starting point from which the rest of their self-declared \"flaws\" will stem from - and addressing it makes things simpler. But they have to want to change, of course. And that goes back to ego.\n\nIdeally, everyone benefits. They get over themselves, they get over their self-loathing, and everyone they interact with enjoys their company, and it becomes a positive feedback loop of life.\nSunkenStone: &gt; The point is this ego discussion is a starting point from which the rest of their self-declared \"flaws\" will stem from\n\nWhat do you mean by this? That the idea is to make 'you have a massive ego' the central flaw in a self-loathing person's mind? You state the ideal outcomes, but none of them rely on this specific framing being at the root of things.\nakosgi: You're greatly simplifying what I'm saying to fit your narrative against my theme.\n\nThe point is, the more time and mind space you waste on thinking about yourself, the less time and mind space you have on learning and growing from the world around you. When you enter social interactions, you want to have a growth and contribution mentality to see things through. For many, it requires understanding that when they're spending so much time thinking about themselves, it's an ego problem, and this initiates a different train of thought than their status quo.\n\nIt's a pedant's exercise to look at a single element of the overall message and attempt to completely discredit the value around it. I wrote another post specifically for pedants that do this:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/iydnj9/protip_not_everyone_will_say_things_exactly_how/\n\nAnd as an aside, if you're not seeing the amount of responses that have said this has actually helped them think differently about the way they are and it's working for them, then that's on you.\nSunkenStone: When your initial post is so nebulous, it makes sense to want to \"simplify\" it to something concrete so it can be parsed properly. I have no problem with this:\n\n&gt;  The more time and mind space you waste on thinking about yourself, the less time and mind space you have on learning and growing from the world around you. When you enter social interactions, you want to have a growth and contribution mentality to see things through.\n\nI do have a problem with this:\n\n&gt; For many, it requires understanding that when they're spending so much time thinking about themselves, it's an ego problem, and this initiates a different train of thought than their status quo.\n\nThe way you originally phrased this in your OP was indistinguishable from a description of narcissism. True narcissists, people with NPD, are commonly understood to be unfixable, fundamentally flawed people. [This comic](https://old.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/rbuw44/truth_be_told_you_probably_have_ego_problems/hnsr3qd/), which you responded positively to, shows the much more likely outcome of telling a self-loathing person that they're actually incredibly vain. It doesn't spur them to action, it creates another layer of paralyzing shame.\n\nYou seem partial to calling people pedants, both in this comment section and in the past. Isn't that a bit hypocritical coming from you? Shouldn't these people who are getting flack for phrasing their advice in frankly abusive ways (or \"behind a wall of negativity\" as you would put it) just discipline themselves and make their messaging more palatable? Especially when the unpleasant bits are unnecessary for getting the theme across. Or does discipline only apply to one's self and you can't call on other people to practice it? I get that in a \"I can only control my actions and my reaction to the world and I have to make the best of that\" way, but this specific instance does have a bit of doormat energy.\n\nWith regards to your aside, I'm not responding here because I have some abstract notion that this could hypothetically be bad. When I was a lot less stable, things like your first two paragraphs in the OP and the comic linked above were directly and severely harmful to my mental well-being. I don't deny that it helps some people. I just have doubts that the number of people it helps and the degree to which it helps them outweighs the number of people it harms and the degree to which it harms them. That's why I bothered commenting in the first place; I just don't see how this could help more people than it hurts.\nakosgi: Alright, I got time today.\n\nPoint 1:\n\n&gt;The way you originally phrased this in your OP was indistinguishable from a description of narcissism.\n\nThis is a straw man of my discussion, and then an attack on that straw man. I have not claimed them to be narcissists, and am therefore not saying they are unfixable, fundamentally flawed people. Then again, I was never outright accused of the narcissists stuff, so there is plausible deniability to claim that's not what was being insinuated. But one can infer.\n\nPoint 2:\n\n&gt;This comic, which you responded positively to, shows the much more likely outcome of telling a self-loathing person that they're actually incredibly vain. It doesn't spur them to action, it creates another layer of paralyzing shame.\n\nThis is not how I interpreted this comic. I read it as this person found it so profound that they are actually taking the time to process it. Interpretations differ.\n\nPoint 3:\n\n&gt;Shouldn't these people who are getting flack for phrasing their advice in frankly abusive ways (or \"behind a wall of negativity\" as you would put it) just discipline themselves and make their messaging more palatable? \n\nOf course. But then, shortly thereafter,\n\n&gt;I get that in a \"I can only control my actions and my reaction to the world and I have to make the best of that\" way\n\nSo the solution was basically discussed immediately. And then finally, this thought is ended with \n\n&gt;this specific instance does have a bit of doormat energy.\n\nwhich is, again, a personal interpretation of this. Taking it with such a negative connotation is exactly against the prior citation that I made.\n\nPoint 4:\n\n&gt;I'm not responding here because I have some abstract notion that this could hypothetically be bad\n\nBut then,\n\n&gt;things like your first two paragraphs in the OP and the comic linked above were directly and severely harmful to my mental well-being\n\nThese two sentences conflict with each other. \n\n&gt;I just have doubts that the number of people it helps and the degree to which it helps them outweighs the number of people it harms and the degree to which it harms them\n\nThe overall popularity of this post begs to differ. But also, that statement is in direct contraction with\n\n&gt;I'm not responding here because I have some abstract notion that this could hypothetically be bad.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm unsure as to what the point of all this is.\n\nedited for format\nSunkenStone: To clarify, I am explicitly saying that you have portrayed the self-loathing as narcissists. I don't think you need to say it directly in order to have done so, either. If I described someone as, \"having a head so over-inflated with thoughts of themselves that they aren't giving their thought space the necessary room to interact with and understand the rest of the world; their subconscious is terrified of anything that can challenge this fragile ego,\" I would be describing a narcissist. The unfixable, fundamentally flawed part follows from this. If you can't see why I think this implication exists, I thank you for reading but I don't think we'll be able to come to any sort of resolution.\n\nMy point about controlling your own actions goes along with \"does discipline only apply to one's self and you can't call on other people to practice it\". I'm saying that asking people to tolerate the \"wall of negativity\" in order to find the sections of good advice when the advice giver could have simply not put the negativity in, effectively demanding discipline from one's self while not requiring it of others, is doormat-like.\n\nMy last paragraph is not contradictory. I'm saying that I'm not someone merely theorizing that this could hurt people. I know for a fact that it can because things near identical to it did hurt me in the past. Furthermore, because I know it can hurt people, that makes me question whether or not this helps more people than it hurts.\n\nMy overall point is that telling people that if they hate themselves it's actually a sign that they're a terrible person is reckless, and that this implication didn't need to be in your post at all to make it effective. Changing the faux tough love title to something else and just including everything from \"Couple points\" to the end would result in a post with the same impact, from my point of view. For the record I'm not trying to get you to change your post because you're right that it drew a lot of engagement.\nakosgi: Point 1:\n\n&gt;To clarify, I am explicitly saying that you have portrayed the self-loathing as narcissists.\n\nAlright, I appreciate you clarifying. Thanks to this, saying \n\n&gt;The unfixable, fundamentally flawed part follows from this.\n\nIs textbook straw man fallacy - you are purposely misrepresenting my argument (and then applying extraneous characteristics to my argument) in order to present an attack. If anything, I spend copious amounts of effort on this sub attempting to help people change and grow themselves, because I don't believe they are fundamentally flawed or unfixable. You're right, we won't come to resolution here because your interpretation is not fact, so stop presenting it like it is.\n\nPoint 2:\n\n&gt;\"does discipline only apply to one's self and you can't call on other people to practice it\".\n\nYou cannot discipline someone else. You can suggest discipline but not force them to act differently.\n\n&gt;effectively demanding discipline from one's self while not requiring it of others, is doormat-like.\n\nAgain, you keep spewing this interpretation as if I'm supposed to agree. It's not fact. And what's worse is that you have stated before: \n\n&gt;\"I can only control my actions and my reaction to the world and I have to make the best of that\"\n\nSo you clearly understand the constructive theme that I'm attempting to convey, but are actively ignoring it for the sake of argument.\n\nPoint 3:\n\n&gt;telling people that if they hate themselves it's actually a sign that they're a terrible person\n\nThis is not what I've done, but again, you seem to be very loose with your interpretations of my words.\n\nPoint 4:\n\n&gt;Changing the faux tough love title to something else and just including everything from \"Couple points\" to the end would result in a post with the same impact, from my point of view.\n\nIf all this detracted so much, then the post, its current state, wouldn't have received such a positive response.\n\nPoint 5:\n\n&gt;For the record I'm not trying to get you to change your post because you're right that it drew a lot of engagement.\n\nThis is an outright lie. You can't spend an entire post attempting to disassemble my post then end it with this sentence as a CYA. \n\nPoint 6:\n\nIf your overall focus was \n\n&gt;I just have doubts that the number of people it helps and the degree to which it helps them outweighs the number of people it harms and the degree to which it harms them.\n\nThen it shows how shoddy an argument you're making, due to how you've been actively seeking to spin everything in the most disgusting, incendiary, and vicious interpretations possible. I'll admit that some of it is blunt, but when someone actively misinterprets and misrepresents a statement to twist what's been said, misses the actionable advice and resolutions, and then harms themselves (either physically or mentally) because of their twisted interpretation, that's out of anyone's control but that person. \n\nSummary:\n\nI'm sorry that you're doing this and have a thought space where you feel the need to do this, and do hope you, or anyone you're speaking for, can heal and be better.\nSunkenStone: I'm not going to dignify a comment that ends with a \"who hurt you sweatie\"-type remark with a real response, and I'm exceedingly glad I refrained from mentioning the exact nature of the harm I experienced.

Thanks!\n\nDragon_Flags: Here's my two cents; I'm no expert but have been exercising (Endurance, Oly, Power, &amp; Calisthenics) under the guidance of a highly qualified Personal Trainer for a few years.\n\nSuper Sets are great.  Period.  I triple set when I eat, that's how amazing I think they are.  But know yourself by listening to your body.\n\nEat a light pre-game snack before.  Always eat afterwards, ALWAYS.\n\nWhat is Cardio?  The taxing of your heart and blood vessels.  Running in the morning is optimal.  Run when it's bitching cold, run when it rains.\n\nYes, your routine targets all the muscles.  But you have accessory exercises in which I feel are unnecessary, such as calf exercises and bicep exercises.  Unless you're doing this for \"show muscles\" they're a waste of time.  Large compound exercises will develop functional strength and train your motor skills.\n\nYour Monday as a compound of BW with Legs is overkill.  Legs deserve their own day.  Focus more on Squat Variations/Deadlift Variations/Glute Ham Raises/Sprints/Jumping.\n\nAre there any benefits to yoga or tai chi when it comes to Strength/Endurance/Fat Loss?  Yes, and more.\n\nDips or HSPU's?  Why not both?\n\nKeep up the good work!  Ask if you have any questions or need emphasis.\n161803398874989: &gt; What is Cardio? The taxing of your heart and blood vessels. Running in the morning is optimal. Run when it's bitching cold, run when it rains.\n\nI run much, much better in the evening because in the morning I'm not properly awake.\nDragon_Flags: 1. It's generally cooler in the morning than it is mid-afternoon, so the morning, or running at dusk, is the best time of day to head out in the Summer, unless you enjoy being chained to your treadmill.\n\n2. Most races take place in the morning, so you can get your body acclimated to the time of day that a race is being held.\n\n3. If you live on a busy street, there aren't as many cars on the road at 5 a.m.\n\n4. If you have a busy day ahead of you, you can get up early and just get your run done and out of the way, instead of waiting until later in the day, and then having to skip your workout.\n\n5. Morning workouts actually help you wake up so that you're more alert throughout the rest of the day.\n\n6.

{"full_text": "reasonably_doubtful1: Theists need to believe in libertarian free will in order to provide an adequate response to the problem of evil.\n\notah007: &gt; Hart\u2019s defense of universalism and his apparent rejection of libertarian free will made me consider whether the four propositions below are jointly compatible:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. God exists.\n&gt; 2. If God exists, then there is no world that is better than the actual world.\n&gt; 3. We do not have libertarian free will.\n&gt; 4. Everyone will eventually go to heaven.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this post, I will argue that these four propositions are not jointly compatible.  \n\nUm...who actually believes all four of these? The argument is pointless because nobody holds all of these beliefs simultaneously anyway.\nfitzroy95: number 2) is clearly bullshit.\n\nIf God exists, (s)he can create whatever kind of world (s)he wants to, including a world of misery and suffering in order to teach people things, or a world of happiness and light which rains puppies and unicorn farts blow flowers everywhere. Or anything in between because God's \"plan\" is ineffable, and as such you can't presume anything about God's will, intentions or plan.\nReddit_Repartee: You're really not keeping to the theist definition of \"God\" here. God isn't just a powerful being, according to the tradition being considered here, he is omnibenevolent. If a powerful being created the universe with malicious intent or anything other than maximal good possible, he wouldn't be \"God\" by that very definition. You can certainly try to attack the idea that God is necessarily omnibenevolent, but a Christian would likely say that a non-benevolent God is like a married bachelor -- it is a contradiction. I'm not a theist, but if you're going to attack the theist's argument, at least entertain his primary axiom.\neterneraki: Omni benevolence is not an attribute that all religions accept as fact.\nReddit_Repartee: Agreed completely. However, the author of the argument being considered is from the Greek Orthodox tradition, a subdivision of the Christian tradition. Therefore, attempting to parse the argument outside of that tradition is like trying to critique one view of  metaphysics by using a completely different, potentially incompatible view.\neterneraki: This is the first time I'm hearing that greek orthodox adherents believe in omni benevolence, but I guess if that's the case then we can continue down that argument. But then \"best world\" is relative and separate rabbit hole\nSocile: As my previous comment was removed for expressing an opinion, I will assert as fact that I am more benevolent than the Judeo-Christian \u201cGod.\u201d  I would simply choose to give one less child terminal cancer.  Therefore, I AM more benevolent than God.\n\nAlso, by virtue of being real, I am more benevolent.\nJWOLFBEARD: This is riddled with fallacies. For instance, what shows that one less case of cancer provides greater benevolence?\nSocile: Preventing suffering.  This is one example.  I could eliminate diarrhea altogether with a thought and prevent loads of suffering.\nJWOLFBEARD: Yes. But there could be major repercussions to eliminating diarrhea that would cause greater suffering.\nsawbladex: couldn't you just fix that?\n\nSure, it might be an infinite rabbit hole of fixing, but omni-whatever is the biggest infinite, so there you go.\nJWOLFBEARD: Right. So that shows that there may not be a better level of beneficence available.\nsawbladex: By shows, ... you mean a really weird thought experiment that makes assumptions that the world can only be exactly the way it is .... for some nebulous goodness.\n\nA god whose max goodness involves me be hit by a car is one I could do without.\nweebeardedman: But, the thing is, \"gods plan\" isn't about you. That's the whole point, it doesn't matter at all what happens to individuals, it's what is good for humanity as a whole. God might be all powerful, but hes also all knowing, and knows that every action has a consequence. Being all powerful is \"pointless\" if you're trapped into acting with what you think will result in the \"best outcome.\" If, for example in this \"car crash,\" you die but the other person would kill more than 2 people...net gain. Or, if the crash resulted in someone being inspired to study safety related engineering and ended up saving many more lives...net gain.\n\n\n\nIf, for things to be \"the best they can be\" for everyone, and that involves you being hit by a car, then you gon be hit by a car. \n\nAt least that's how I understand the whole suffering existing thing if a God could exist.\nSocile: There are people who seem to suffer (and/or die) for no reason at all (diseases, mutilation, psychological suffering, etc.).  To say that this is necessary on a macro scale is an extraordinary claim from no evidence and would require quite a lot of evidence to be anything but a joke.\nknaet: The thing to remember is that much of the theological approach here is definitive. For example, the following \"truths\":\n\n1. God is that which nothing greater (i.e. \"gooder\") can be conceived.\n2. God exists.\n3. God is omnibenevolent (among other things) (again, by definition, because he is the \"goodest\").\n4. God created the universe as best as it possibly can be, because god is omnibenevolent.\n5. Suffering is a part of the best possible option.\n\nThere are certainly some issues here, but that's the gist of it. It leads to all kinds of weird conclusions...but that's neither here nor there.\n\nAnd remember, theology is ultimately based in faith, which is to say the virtue of actively *not* relying on evidence.\noffensivename: &gt;which is to say the virtue of actively not relying on evidence.\n\nThat's not entirely true. Faith doesn't mean rejecting all evidence. It's simply a means to bridge the gap between what you can prove and what you cannot prove. People with a belief in the supernatural rely on facts as much as anyone else. They just hold personal belief and experiences to be of equal or greater weight when it comes to such matters.\nknaet: I didn't mean to say faith is a rejection of evidence. I mean to say that faith is believing in something *without* it.\noffensivename: Fair enough. Though I don't think that's exactly right either. I would say that it's believing in something without a certain level of evidence. Incontrovertible maybe? Is that the right word? Theists have all kinds of evidence for their beliefs. It's just not evidence that atheists find credible. The same goes for people who believe in ghosts or psychics or other supernatural occurrences.\nknaet: That is a really good point. I've never really thought about them as seeing their reasons to believe as evidence, and from their perspective it must look like it. I generally think of evidence as a scientific or empirical thing, but there is certainly an argument to made against that.\n\nDo you think it detracts from the perceived value of faith, though, if they see themselves as actually using evidence? I don't know what doctrine on this actually says...\noffensivename: I'm not familiar with a religious tradition that would consider having some sort of evidence to devalue faith. If you look at Christianity specifically, the Judeo-Christian God often gave direct evidence of his existence through miracles, directly conversing with people, etc. Then there's Jesus who played it a bit more cool when it came to declaring himself God, but provided evidence of his divinity in the form of miracles as well.\n\nIn present day, isn't that what the whole field of apologetics is about? Much of it centers around attempting to prove the unprovable by using logic and reason. Then of course there's people like Ken Ham who use generally pretty bogus science to attempt to prove their beliefs. There's obviously a lot of Christians who are not down with what Ham is doing with his creation museum and Answers in Genesis website, but I think it has more to do with it being bad science than any philosophical objections to an evidence-inclusive belief system.\nknaet: Hmm, I may be remembering incorrectly. I have some pretty distinct memories of my church days where it was frowned upon to bring up evidence or proof, because god values faith in and of itself. Relying on evidence implies some sort of doubt in the Word itself, and we know from the example of Thomas that doubt is a bad trait to have. \n\nThe strict adherence to faith is what drove me away in the first place...and now I'm starting to wonder if it was my understanding of what faith meant more than anything. Or perhaps it's just how the methodists approach it that I didn't like? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm happily divorced from the church, but it's a weird thing to analyze from this side of that choice.\n", "prompt": "reasonably_doubtful1: Theists need to believe in libertarian free will in order to provide an adequate response to the problem of evil.\n\notah007: &gt; Hart\u2019s defense of universalism and his apparent rejection of libertarian free will made me consider whether the four propositions below are jointly compatible:", "orig": "&gt;\n&gt; 1.

{"full_text": "ScienceWasLove: Electrical advice for pole barn\nI have a 28' x 35' pole barn that is in the process of being finished. \n\nI am currently planning the install of the electrical circuits. \n\nI have a 100 amp square d panel with lots of breakers from 10 to 30 amps I picked up at a yard sale for $50. I say this because I have lots of room in the panel. \n\nFirst question: I was planning on putting  1 gang outlet (my FIL thinks they should all be 2 gang) on each pole (13 total) at the height of the second 2x4 that runs horizontal. This would also include an outlet at the panel and one at the pillar between the garage doors. I am not sure if this should be separated into one or two 10, 15, or 20 amp circuits. The largest load will be a big air compressor and maybe a drill press, grinder, and chop saw down the road. My dad has a dedicated wood shop - so I won't be going crazy with that equipment. Would you use double or single gang?\n\nSecond: Next I was planning on running two lighting circuits. One for the interior and one for the exterior. The pole barn has a second floor. I want to setup each circuit so they can be turned on/off at three places - two man doors on the pole barn and one man door on existing garage - I plan to run these wires with the service wires in a separate conduit. Can I run 15 4 foot twin 80 watt fluorescent  lights on one 10, 15, 20 amp circuit? I was planning on running 5 lights over each bay and 5 in the attic. Is this over kill? How would you light the space? \n\nThird: Should I have any problem using a bathroom fan timer to power a switch for the air compressor and for my cordless drill charger?\n\nThanks. \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/uie4lfl7ghexqxi/2015-06-23%2007.59.02.jpg?dl=0\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/d9wzyjo4xb36ckx/2015-06-23%2007.59.06.jpg?dl=0\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/t690kaoabmppj15/2015-06-23%2007.59.15.jpg?dl=0\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ffj28dhj3icgry1/2015-06-23%2007.59.30.jpg?dl=0\ndz93: Put all the outlets on 20A breakers unless you know the load will be higher. The compressor should probably be on a circuit by itself depending on the amp draw. \n\nWhat I usually do in pole barns is wire every other outlet on its own circuit. So you'd have two total circuits for your general use outlets and every other outlet in line will be on different circuits. So, for example, you'll have one outlet on circuit one, then the outlet next to it would be on circuit two. Then the next outlet back on circuit one. Its just good practice to do this in case you have two high amp devices plugged in near each other. Not necessary but good practice. \n\nAnything on a 20amp circuit should use 12 gauge wire. Do NOT use 14. A lot of people use for 14 for outlets to save money. It'll work and it'll be fine if you use 14 but its not a good idea. We always use 12 gauge for 20 amp circuits unless the situation calls for something different. \n\n\nIf you want to know how to size your circuits just take the wattage for an individual light, (80w) and divide it by 120v. That comes out to about 0.7A per light fixture. Multiply that by the amount of lights you have and there's your total amps for your circuit. \n\nI'm sure I left a lot of details out so please ask if you need to know anymore. Ill be glad to help. \n\n\nEdit: And I know this goes without saying but ground everything. A lot of times people don't care about grounding things. I'd recommend getting grounding tails that screw into each metal box you use for your outlets. By doing this, if there's ever a short somewhere or something comes loose inside a box, it'll trip the breaker before anything gets too hot and causes a fire. Its not likely but there's always that chance. \n\nEdit 2: If you have more than 20amps worth of lighting or close to 20, which I doubt you do, I'd recommend splitting the lighting up into multiple circuits. Use only 20 amp breakers or smaller for the lighting. Like I said, you'll just have to calculate the amp draw.\n\nAnd could you provide more information about that bathroom fan timer? Why not use a normal switch?\nScienceWasLove: Thanks. The bathroom timer would allow each device to run for 60 minutes and shut off. For the air compressor it would prevent it from running all day and the same with the charger. \ndz93: I'm not sure about that. I've never had to put a compressor on a timer. Maybe someone else can give some better advice for this. If it was me, I'd just go buy a more heavy duty timer. But if you have questions about any of the other work being done or if you're unsure about something don't hesitate to ask. There is no dumb question when it comes to electrical work lol. \nScienceWasLove: Turns out my compressor is 13 amp. I was going to use a time like this: \n\nhttp://www.capitalelectricalsupply.com/product-p/intermatic-fd60mc.htm?gclid=CjwKEAjwh6SsBRCYrKHF7J3NjicSJACUxAh7aM1UHvJztOc43SmM_3CNViWKhvMa0x-wjNWYC0smIRoCnwbw_wcB&amp;utm_medium=shoppingengine&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;cvsfa=3622&amp;cvsfe=2&amp;cvsfhu=496e7465726d617469632d464436304d43\n\nbut it is rated at 10 amps. \n\nI will see if I can find one with a higher rating. \n\nThat particular timer is kinda neat because the timer is mechanical like an old school alarm clock and mechanics trips the electric switch. \ndz93: Use a 20A breaker on the compressor. Sometimes they draw higher amp when starting than what its rated for. It'll run at 13 amps but when it kicks on it could get up around 15 amps for a few seconds. It may not be enough to trip the breaker but just use a 20 amp. That's what I'd do. \n\nAnd yes, you'll want a timer that can handle the amp draw from the compressor. It shouldn't be too hard for you to find. \n", "prompt": "ScienceWasLove: Electrical advice for pole barn\nI have a 28' x 35' pole barn that is in the process of being finished. \n\nI am currently planning the install of the electrical circuits. \n\nI have a 100 amp square d panel with lots of breakers from 10 to", "orig": "30 amps I picked up at a yard sale for $50.

I find the floors a little bouncy and would like to stiffen everything up. The 2x10 joists span 14ft, which from what I've read is code but bare minimum. I have access below the kitchen where there is a 2.5ft crawl space. I want to sister these with plywood and then add blocking.\n\n\nHow should I stagger the seams? Do the first layer 3ft 8ft 3ft pieces. Then the second layer do two 7ft pieces? \n\n\nI'll use construction adhesive between layers but should I use 16D nails or screws? \n\n\nShould I leave a small space between the subfloor and plywood to prevent any future squeaking?\n\n\nI also though about adding a beam perpendicular across the center of the crawl space to cut the joist span in half. It would actually be three separate beams to avoid having to remove any of the existing lines that are in the way. Although every joist would still rest on a beam. The posts are supposed to sit on footings but I'm thinking some cement blocks should suffice.\n\n\nHere's a bad photo of the [crawl space](http://imgur.com/lMm9Wgu)\n\nI also have much more work in the crawl space once the floor has been stiffened up.\n\nThanks\nslowman4130: why plywood? \n\nplywood has every other layer going 90*, so only half the plies are going to be helping you. You're better off laminating another 2x10 to the original ones, or putting in a beam down the middle like you suggested to break the span. \n\nIn theory I suppose you could add a 2x6 \"shoe piece\" to the joists to make them like an upside down \"T\" beam, but probably more hassle than it's worth, when you can just add a beam down the middle and break the span. \nPaxonator: Well many say plywood is just as strong, and easier to install. Also it doesn't fluctuate in size as much as regular lumber. I cannot get 14ft 2x10's beside the originals. Longest on many might be 10ft due to all the lines under the crawl space being in the way.\n\nI've read about doing the 2x6 along the bottom of each joist. Just have not heard of many people actually doing it.\n\nThe beam would probably solve all the bounce issues.\ntherealpygon: Just as strong: No.   \nEasier to install: Yes.   \nDoesn't fluctuate in size as much: Doesn't matter as much.\n\nIn order of effect on bounce:\n\n1. Center Support\n2. 2x10 sistering + Blocking\n3. 2x10 sistering \n4. Plywood sistering + Blocking\n5. Plywood sistering\n6. Blocking\n\nIn order of effort, exactly the reverse of the above.\n\nPlywood has half the strength of its solid wood counterpart -- adding 3/4\" plywood to each side of the joists would approximately be equivalent to having 3\" joists (2.25-2.5\" actual). With blocking it should do a fair amount to help the bounce. If you're in a position to be able to add a center support or use 2x10s, however, I would go with that.\ndbhyslop: I sistered the joists under my kitchen and it made a tremendous improvement in the stiffness of the floor.  Since they don't need to go all the way onto the sill plates they're easy to install.  I used construction adhesive and lots of screws, maybe three every foot or so.\nPaxonator: Did you use regular dimensional lumber or plywood?\ndbhyslop: Regular lumber.  The plywood sounds crazy.\nPaxonator: Believe it or not I've seen Mike Holmes use plywood on one episode. Also this old house has a tutorial as well.

We get along, talk about all kinds of topics, support each other, our personalities are quite similar, and we usually bond over cats. But the other day we kind of had an issue.\n\nWe were texting and he told me he had just shaved, so we started talking about shaving. He mentioned how he likes to shave his whole body except for his legs and arms, and I said I like to shave my whole body. So he asked me if I shave \u201cdown there\u201d.\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, we get along and talk about all kinds of topics, we\u2019ve talked about sexuality before (but in a more general way) and it\u2019s totally fine by me, but I personally don\u2019t like talking about that private stuff. So I laughed and sent a thinking emoji. A couple minutes later, he asked if I was embarrassed, and I said that I just don\u2019t really like talking about that stuff. He asked if I was scared, and said that he likes being open with me. I said I like being open with him as well.\n\nHe sent a smiley emoji, so I thought everything was fine.

Why is he mad? Because I didn\u2019t tell him whether I shave down there or not?\n\nThat was the other day. I didn\u2019t say anything to him, and he hasn\u2019t tagged me in any cat posts\u2026 I want to make up.

Also note when she changes pose with her hand or leg that she keeps her expression and body completely still - she's clearly a pro and has rehearsed those hand movements enough to do them in her sleep. So even if there is slight residual blur because of hand movement, the image as a whole would appear sharp.\nLostiniowabut713irl: Flash is slow shutter. There are some high speed syncs out now, but nah, 1/250 is typical. It is the flash duration that freezes motion, not shutter speed.\ndamiandarko2: it\u2019s definitely the shutter speed that freezes the motion\nLostiniowabut713irl: What kind of flash do you use?\ndamiandarko2: oh what\u2019re you doing tryna check my credentials? if i don\u2019t use an expensive flash i\u2019m not qualified to know what shutter speed is? please. shutter speed is what freezes her motion. if the lens was open longer and the flash was on, she would not be frozen\ntimraudio: You are entirely incorrect.\n\nFlash will freeze motion better than shutter speed.\n\nI could have Parkinson's, shoot at 1\\30 and still get perfectly sharp shots with a flash.\n\nAnd less so than \"checking your credentials\", I think he was checking if you had ever used flash before, as the ability to freeze motion is usually the first thing people notice when they get their first flash.\nErikasKabak: 1/30 is not slow, that is very normal and usable speed if you are shooting at 24mm, it's only a small fraction of a second.\nTry doing 1 full second without a tripod, on a moving subject with a flash, 10 flashes, 1000 flashes.\nThen try no flash and 1/200 of a second.\ntimraudio: I've shot hundreds of sharp photos with multi-second shutter speed and a flash.\n\nI used 1\\30 as an example as that's about as low as anyone would go before blur becomes an issue in natural light, \"1\\2*focal length equivalent\" is a good rule of thumb for avoiding hand shake, 1\\shutter speed if you have ibis (but obviously that doesn't stop the subject moving, only the camera). If you're shaking with Parkinson's you could drop to a 10mm lens and still have blur issues at 1\\30.\n\nAnd I can promise that my setup takes sharper photos than 1\\200 shutter speed natural light, hell I'm exposing for less than 1\\10th of that time usually (you expose with light, not shutter speed).\nErikasKabak: I was talking about 1 full second, not 1/30. 1/30 is fast, I've seen sharp images in 1/15 so what?\nI'm saying that if you have 1s shutter and a moving subject, no matter how much light you have you won't freeze the subject, unless your shutter is higher. Shutter is responsible for freezing the subject in the image. Light is responsible for Illuminating the subject. You can freeze the subject with insufficient light, the image will be dark, but the subject will be frozen.\ntimraudio: Yes, you will freeze the subject with a flash.\n\nAnd any shutter speed can be sharp on a tripod...\n\nLook, here's a frozen subject on a 5 second exposure with lots of movement from the camera. https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/TS560x560~forums/60528177/3aec642ce45447758c7d5de5e0c9a538\n\nThere's no such thing as \"insufficient light\", only the correct light for the photo you want to take.\nErikasKabak: Ok I understand what technique you are talking about. The subject freezes here only because it's dark and the sensor gets only a fraction of a second Illumination, the movement you see in the image happens before or after the quick Illumination, but at the time the flash shoots from begining to end the subject is not moving, ir moving so slow that it doesn't make a difference. But this is just copying what the shutter does - illuminate the subject for a period of time to the sensor, the shorter the Illumination the more frozzen the subject will be and the longer - the more blurred it will be.\nWhat I was saying that there is no way to freeze the subject with long illumination unless you have this specific scenario where you have to have everything dark enough so that the subject is visible to the camera only when the flash goes off.\nThe light streaks around the girl aren't frozen, because of the shutter not the flash, if there is no light on the subject it will not blurr, but we are photographing light and light will always be blurred in 5s exposure time when it's moving.\ntimraudio: The camera doesn't decide when the flash goes off or how bright it is, the photographer does.\n\nThe sun or lightbulb doesn't dictate how bright the image is, the photographer does.\n\nA photo is made up of whatever light hits the sensor, opening the shutter just gives the sensor the opportunity to be hit by light, if no light (or light beyond its dynamic range at a given gain\\iso) hits it, then you're not going to get anything.\n\nAnd yes, a camera in 2022 will do things automatically, but offering an easy option for people that don't know how to take photos in no way detracts from what a photographer is. At least no more than the demo track on a Casio keyboard makes the person that pressed that button a musician.\nErikasKabak: and the point?\nMy point still stays the same. The shutter will dictate how much time you record the light. Yes it's controlled by the person, but it still is responsible for it.\nYou can't take a frozzen picture of a light bulb that is moving and constantly shining on the sensor without making your shutter higher, not 1s.\ntimraudio: I'm not at home at the moment, but I'm happy to prove you wrong when I get back\nErikasKabak: Ok. If you want to. 5 second shutter, a shining light bulb, no other light, no turning it off, no obscuring it or turning the camera away, moving at 4mph. I want to see an image where the light bulb frozen in action.\ntimraudio: Deal, on the provision you write a full apology post on r/shitredditsays when I prove you wrong.\nErikasKabak: if you don't cheat and prove it. Not just a photo of a frozen lightbulb m, but somehow I could see that you did it the way I wrote,  and show that, then ok\ntimraudio: Exif data will have all the info you need.\nErikasKabak: Not all. How would I know if you didn't use a flash that's not connected to the camera you took the photo with or any other light? How would I know if you didn't obscure the light bulb in any part of that 5 seconds, or turned it off? All I would see would be a light bulb and data with 5s shutter, but it's meaningless, because you can do 10 other things to make that light bulb freeze in the photo\ntimraudio: I love how you're already desperately backtracking and making excuses.\n\nAnd you haven't even promised me my apology thread on shitredditsays yet!\nErikasKabak: How am I backtracking?

{"full_text": "-ondo-: YSK that you can take large corporations to small claims court and you may have a good chance of winning\n(I am **NOT** a lawyer)\n\nWhy YSK: So you don't feel powerless when a large company gives you service you're not happy with. (Not to say be a Karen. Treat companies and workers with kindness and respect at all times)\n\nMy personal example comes from buying a new truck a handful of years ago. I went to the dealership and ordered a truck from the manufacturer so it was exactly how I wanted and I wouldn't have to settle for what was in inventory. I waited the 6-8 weeks and received my truck. Beautiful new truck just a bit dusty from being delivered.\n\nI took it home from the dealer and started the process of detailing it. One of the reasons I bought it, besides kind of needing it, was so I had something to keep nice and clean. I kept my former truck for work so it would get dirty instead.\n\nAs I was working on the paint on the outside I noticed small blemishes in the paint under the clear coat. Not easy to see but they were inside the paint and all over the truck. I wasn't happy at all especially considering what I paid. I went back to the dealership knowing full well it wasn't their fault but I had to start somewhere.\n\nTheir service manager and \"auto body guy\" both looked at it and agreed, the paint shouldn't be like that. They put me in touch with the auto manufacturer's regional representative and he offered me $800 in dealer accessories. I had just ordered the truck with everything I wanted so this didn't help me much. After a few weeks of talking to the rep and not getting any real offer to fix or make up for my paint, I went to my local reputable auto body shop and got an estimate to fix the paint.\n\nBlemishes under the clear coat generally can't be \"fixed\", gotta repaint usually. The auto body shop said they couldn't/wouldn't try to fix it but gave me an estimate to repaint the panels with flaws for $4800.\n\nI got nowhere with the auto rep again so I went to my local courthouse and filed a small claims with the auto manufacturer (not the dealer). The claim was filed for $6000. $4800 for the estimate and $1200 for putting up with weeks of their bullshit (a number I just pulled out of my ass).\n\nA week before the court date I got a letter from the manufacturer's legal department offering me $4800, the amount of the estimate. I answered by the email they sent declining the offer. My counter offer was $5900 just to show them I went down but also \"screw you\". Two days before the court date they replied, agreed to the $5900, and sent me paperwork to sign.\n\nThe big thing is they didn't want to bother sending a representative to small claims court, wasting the the reps time and just costing money anyway. If they didn't send one then I would have won so it was easier in their eyes to just settle and write a check.\n\nI don't get as upset at bad service or products anymore knowing at least there's a chance things can be made right.\n\n-- Do not take legal advice from me.

Please excuse spelling and grammar --\n-- Have a great weekend! --\nPyanfars: Unfortunately, city hall where I live is like that. Any lawsuit against them less than 10K, they just cut a check.\nBLMwarriorLGBT: what, you just gotta mention how you're going to sue your city hall for $9,999 and they'll just pay you to think twice?\n\nhow many lawsuits can you come up with here?\nSwissyVictory: Most Americans can retire semi comfortably with a million dollars. That's only 101 lawsuits.\nPhotonic_Resonance: So I saw this in a meme, but there was an article headline recently stating that Millennials will need $3 million to \"comfortably retire\". Obviously, there's plenty of places both in and outside of the US where $1 million is more than enough to live comfortably, but I am curious how old that \"$1 million is a retirement measurement\" idea is at this point.\nItWasTheGiraffe: Rule of thumb is that a 4% withdrawal rate on your retirement will reliably fund your expenses longer than you\u2019d ever expect to live. With $1m banked, that\u2019s only $40k a year. That $40k goes further than a $40k salary, as you\u2019re drawing from tax-advantaged accounts and long term cap-gains which are taxed lower than income, but it\u2019s definitely not enough for a life of luxury.\nSwissyVictory: Yeah and you're going to need more if you retire early (like in this senario where you retire immediately).\n\nMost Americans don't retire with 1million dollars. But if I was going to quit my job in the next few years, I'd want atleast 1million.\nItWasTheGiraffe: Definitely agree. Medicare being available at 65 means there\u2019s a much higher bar to clear to retire younger than that. Also that social security still pays out a significant sum if you\u2019ve paid in your whole adult life so retiring early (less paying in) and withdrawing earlier (62 vs 70) both mean you end up taking a smaller benefit.\nSwissyVictory: And you need to factor in, if you're in your 20s to 40s there's no garentee that social security will even be around when it comes your turn, and if it is the collecting age might be signifigantly older. \n\nI wouldn't factor it into my retirement plans unless I absolutely had to, especially if you're retiring signifigantly early.\nItWasTheGiraffe: I agree that you shouldn\u2019t *rely* on social security but it\u2019s pretty na\u00efve to think it won\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a political impossibility to kill a program that millions of the most active voters in the country rely on. And it will never pay out less than it takes in, which is an absolute, worst case, of 70% of full benefits.\nSwissyVictory: Social security only has 13 years left of cash reserves. After that it's going to be cut back to about 80% being funded entirely by current taxes. \n\nPopulation is in decline so the proportion of people who (under the current system) can draw from social security to working class americans going to keep getting larger.  That means more people drawing from it and less people paying in, cutting that precent. \n\nAt the very least it's going to need to be serriously fixed, the age raised again, or benifits will need to be drastically cut. \n\nThen it raises the question, if social security isn't drastically fixed, what's the point of paying into it your whole life if you can't touch it until you're in your 80s, or the payments are so small it's u livable anyway. \n\nMost Republican politicians are against fixing it, and it's their voting base that's in jeopardy.  Some senators like Ron Johnson want to kill it completely.\n\nI dont think it's niave at all to think it won't be there or atleast anywhere close to the same in 30 to 40 years.  Atleast not the the point where you're betting on it being there for your retirement or you're in trouble.\nItWasTheGiraffe: &gt;\tit will never pay out less than it takes in, which is an absolute, worst case, of 70% of full benefits.\nSwissyVictory: Do you have a source on that? All the sources I can find only talk about what happens in 2035. \n\nThe percentage of Americans over 65 has risen 4%, and the percentage of working class Americans (15-64) has fallen 2% from 2010 to 2020.  If that trend continues alone that's less than 66% benifits by 2065.\n", "prompt": "-ondo-: YSK that you can take large corporations to small claims court and you may have a good chance of winning\n(I am **NOT** a lawyer)\n\nWhy YSK: So you don't feel powerless when a large company gives you service you're not happy with.

Was thinking about asking something along that line at some point.\n\nI do Kung Fu forms as well as breathing excercises as an addition of my bw-routine. Not as a warm-up, rather as a \"yin\"-part to it. I do the Wing Chun-forms, as demonstrated by Wong Shun Leung (direct teacher of Bruce Lee or Bruce Lee's Si-Hing which means \"older borther\") [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crmGYEvLVcw) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ckHE4X8yUk) (Done correctly, they can also be regarded as body-line work, since you're supposed to have a straight spine, like in the hollow hold, and tight abs). I do them really slow, so they become more of an [internal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neijia) excercise. I also do the [Micro Cosmic Orbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQ7V2P124) as often as possible. It would be recommended to learn excercises like these from qualified teachers, you need to be corrected, at least in the Wing Chun forms.\n\nI'm thinking about going more into Chi Kung, but actually am pretty happy with my routine right now. Also, what i like about Wing Chun is that it is more of use and a little bit more applyable than Chi Gong or Tai Chi, combines learning something useful, interesting with working out. Obviously, i have a background in Wing Chun, but at the moment i'm also experimenting with Kali-stick drills on top of that, great for mobility. \n\nSo what i'm suggesting is: Find something that you like and integrate it into your routine.\nresolvetochange: Do you believe in all of the energy talk? I like concepts like yoga and kung fu but I look at them like stretching (yoga) and breathing/hot yoga (kung fu). The spirituality / mystics / energy talk turns me off of it a bit though. Just curious what others think about it.\n\nuser23187425: I don't believe it, i experience it.\n\nI can totally understand your reservations. I hate all that guru-shit. But over the years, i've made some experiences. When you start learning to treat yourself with acupuncture and it works, you don't doubt anymore. \n\nIt doesn't have to be spiritual, at least not in the new-age-sense. That's what i really like about the chinese systems, they are down to earth. (Mostly.) I also have my priorities straight. I'm not looking for spiritual enlightenment, i'm looking to be involved in this world. (Which might not be so much different, according to some approaches.)\n\nEDIT: \"\u00d6tzi\" had [acupuncture points tattooed on his body for self-treatment](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/new-tattoos-found-otzi-iceman-support-prehistoric-acupuncture-theory-1485224). This knowledge has just been lost in the west, but fortunatly, not all together.\nresolvetochange: I rather like a few chinese systems, things like acupunture, cupping, etc. I've experienced them because it seemed like something cool to try. They did make me feel good and it was interesting but in terms of medical effect I don't think it made a difference. I do believe that diligence in just about anything is very good, be it breathing exercises / meditating / stretching / etc. So I do believe that any routine people do can help them, I'm just not sure it's because of the value of their routine.\n\nRegarding acupuncture, I've read studies that acupuncture has been proven to have no medical benefit but does show improvement in patient condition. The conclusion of several of these studies is that acupuncture is an efficient placebo effect. I don't doubt that acupuncture can change the way you feel and may have benefits through that but personally I can't put stock in it's energy thing.\nuser23187425: The thing with the studies is that they usually don't apply chinese diagnostics but western diagnostics and test acupuncture based on that. Now what would your result be if you used chinese diagnostics and used western medicine on that, with regards to the the effectiveness of western medicine?\n\nThere are practical reasons for that, science obviously has to define the subject of it's research by its own means. But don't underestimate that there is also a lot of systemic resistance to other knowledge in the science system.\n\nI've had exposure to meditation and stuff like tai chi from my youth on, but to really appreaciate it and feel it took me another ten to fifteen years. The deeper effects are more subtle. But they are completely real for me today. And they are not so out of this world, just look at how mindfulness as a concept is exploding at the moment, this is just one tiny but integral part of all chinese systems.\nintredasted: Here's hoping you'll never run into bedroom problems...for rhinos' sake.\nuser23187425: Thank you, but the usual energy work is quite sufficient to improve my bedroom fu. ;)\nintredasted: So is mine and I don't do any.\n\nHigh-five for quality sex in any case, though!\nuser23187425: Well, the common denominator is bodyweightfitness, so let's attribute it to that!\nintredasted: Hear hear!\n", "prompt": "processus: what's everyone's take on qigong/chi gong/chi kung exercises?\nI know Yoga's pretty popular and well regarded here, so I was wondering if any of you guys have experience with the Chinese \"equivalent\".

If they fight over it then does the last man standing get to claim the culture as their sole property? What if there are 2 Sikhs and 1 Hindu; do the Sikhs get to say that the Hindu is not a part of their culture, or that he has not experienced what it is like to be Indian?\n\nSo, boiling it down; it has a silly history, it has no hard definitions, and it can be used as an invisible weapon to exclude, and potentially insite hatred, towards others.

Very sad story and ending.\nMirions: Pretty sure the woman who lied about the events is still alive, too (if not the murderers as well). This wasn't that long ago in the country's history.\nIKindaLikeRunning: She still denies that his death was her fault (it was).\nnworb200: It was her husbands fault. She had a play in it, but even if everything she said was true her husband still shouldn't have tortured and killed a kid.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Lol no it was 100% HER FAULT for lying. You forget the entire situation would\u2019ve never even happened had it not been for the fact SHE LIED\nSt1834: That's not true.  You can watch [this interview](https://www.matteroffact.tv/full-interview-timothy-tyson-author-blood-emmett-till/) with an historian who investigated the whole thing.  Her husband was actually told something by someone else who was in the store when Till was there.\nBeautifulArtistic649: He never whistled at her though so that\u2019s not true. It was HER who told him in fact she quite literally confessed and said SHE did it. It even says ON the video \u201cCarolyn Bryant, the white shopkeeper who testified that Till had made sexual advances, now says \u201cthat part\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nHow could somebody in the shop have told if he never even did it in the first place?\nSt1834: You're confused.  She might have confessed (this part apparently wasn't recorded by the author she was talking to) to lying at the trial when she exaggerated the encounter and said that Till grabbed her waist.  She didn't lie to her husband or say anything to him.  Someone else in the store told him something.  \n\nAnd accounts differ on whether Till whistled and, if so, why.  His cousin said he whistled at Bryant as a joke.  Some other people say he whistled at a card game.  His mother said he whistled as a verbal tic.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Exactly so there is no concrete proof or claim HE whistled at HER. Also I\u2019m not lying, she admitted TO telling her husband.\nSt1834: Again, she was referencing her lying at the trial when she told the jury that Till grabbed her waist.  That was all she said she lied about.  As for way before that, what led to her husband finding out about this encounter, someone at the store told her husband something.\n\nAnd every account from his friends and family he was with agrees there was a whistle of some kind, just disagrees as to why.  No one says it was malicious.  What Till's mother said about him whistling to overcome a speech impediment is the most likely explanation.\nBeautifulArtistic649: No she wasn\u2019t she said she was lying about him whistling in the first place she confessed on her deathbed. He couldn\u2019t have found out from somebody at the store BECAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED. \n\nOkay, a whistle of some kind doesn\u2019t mean it was directed at her that\u2019s my whole point so what could anybody have told his husband?? \u201cA black boy randomly whistled while your wife was walking by\u201d?? Like what?\nSt1834: &gt;[Carolyn Bryant testified in 1955 that 14-year-old Emmett Till grabbed her and verbally threatened her three days before her husband and brother-in-law abducted and tortured the teenager to death.

Bryant\u2019s wife, Carolyn, was working in the store and spent about one minute alone with Till before others heard him whistle at her. (As Vanity Fair reports, he was said to have a lisp and may not have actually whistled.)](https://eji.org/news/emmett-till-accuser-admits-she-lied/)\nBeautifulArtistic649: What does this prove\nSt1834: It doesn't really prove anything.  Nothing needs to be proven.  This is just teaching you the sequence of events.  Bryant didn't say she lied to her husband, like you think for some reason.  She lied at the trial when she said Till grabbed her.  Till did whistle, for some reason.  Someone at the store saw it and told her husband about it.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Wrong again like I literally just told you she said she lied about him whistling AT HER and multiple other things. He never whistled AT her so why would they go and tell somebody and why would he assume it was at his wife? Also one link is just the same exact thing and doesn\u2019t include the information you said about somebody talking about the whistling\nSt1834: Yes, that is what you keep saying but, as the articles I show you show, that's not right.  Again, she never actually said Till whistled at her.  The people with him have said he whistled.  The most likely explanation was provided by his mother, that it was a speech impediment.  Someone in the store saw this and told her husband.\n\nAgain, Bryant said she lied at the trial.  The lie was that he grabbed her.\nBeautifulArtistic649: What you just said don\u2019t make no sense. How could she not have mentioned the whistling YET claimed they sexually assaulted her?!She surely did both. And also it\u2019s not as if her husband heard about it and went ASAP to go kill Emmet no he had to GO HOME, discuss it with her, and THEN he got her family members and came back and killed Emmet. So if she didn\u2019t lie about the whistle why wouldn\u2019t she said her husband was wrong when he came home to her?? She knew EXACTLY what he was doing and let it happen. It\u2019s her fault. Why would somebody mention Emmet whistling and then go tell somebody that makes 0 sense why would anybody care\nSt1834: &gt;How could she not have mentioned the whistling YET claimed they sexually assaulted her?!She surely did both.\n\nNo.  She said at the trial not that he whistled at her, but that he grabbed her and actually talked to her.  She exaggerated at the trial. Everyone agrees there was a whistle.  The grabbing and verbal assault is what she lied about.\n\n&gt;And also it\u2019s not as if her husband heard about it and went ASAP to go kill Emmet no he had to GO HOME, discuss it with her\n\nNo, her husband was away on a trip and didn't come back until a week after this encounter.  Then, someone who witnessed the encounter told him about it. He and the person who told him about the encounter went to find who it was.  They went around trying to find him and questioning several young black men.  He figured out it was Till, grabbed his brother, and they went and kidnapped him.\nBeautifulArtistic649: No she lied about him whistling AT HER. I never said he didn\u2019t whistle.\n\nNo he didn\u2019t because he literally got his family members to come with him to do it. \n\nAlso like I said WHY would they say a black boy whistled?? How is that relevant to anything\nSt1834: &gt;No she lied about him whistling AT HER. \n\nShe didn't say anything about whistling.  Again, his cousin said he whistled at her as a joke.  Others said he whistled at a card game.  But this was all in interviews long after the incident.\n\n&gt;No he didn\u2019t because he literally got his family members to come with him to do it.\n\nNo he didn't...what?  These are facts.  He came home a few days after the incident, a friend told him about the incident, they went and figured out it was with Till, then he and his brother kidnapped Till.\n\n&gt;Also like I said WHY would they say a black boy whistled?? \n\nBecause he did.  All accounts agree he did.  The most likely reason was a speech impediment.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Why tf would a random ass person care that a black boy whistled and WHY would he assume he whistled at his wife that\u2019s my whole point it makes 0 sense\nSt1834: It wasn't a random ass person, it was a friend of the family.  And something like that was taken as an incredible affront back then.  Till's friends and family who were with them describe running home and being terrified at the perception that Till whistled at her because people got lynched over that stuff.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Okay so, your telling me.. he whistled, somebody told her husband be whistled and he was like \u201coh my god he must\u2019ve whistled at my wife!!\u201d???\nSt1834: Sounds like you don't understand the significance of whistling.

The Mississippi Delta region was at the epicenter of an eruption, where \u201cthe Ku Klux Klan and night riders were part of our daily lives,\u201d Wright recalls in the book.

Which is really stupid because I don't think I know anything about anyone in the class, at least not on a personal level. I am positive they know nothing of me, unless they want to talk about how mean I use to be... but I don't really want that.\n\nThe teacher told us to think about what truths and lie to tell, I was going to be sarcastic and write down \"My favorite color is orange, my second favorite color is blue, and my third favorite color is pink\" or something stupid like that. But he said not to write something stupid like that.\n\nThe class is HUGE. There wasn't even enough seats around for people to sit in. So hopefully they don't get to me, but I am sure we'll be playing this dumb game until Friday.\n\nTips on anything would be helpful here\nseryue: i find that taking deep breaths beforehand and periodically reminding myself to pause and talk at a moderate pace helps a ton!\n\nPractice reciting exactly what you want to say to yourself, it can help not going in blind even if you know your general idea of the truths and one lie\n\nIf making eye contact worries you it can help to just focus on the space of nose between their eyes or on their eyebrows ! Generally no one notices the difference, good luck!\nRosemaryKitty: Thank you! Making eye contact sometimes worries me, but I guess it just depends on who I'm looking at. But thanks! I will just look at noses hehe\n\nWhen talking, how can I keep a good tone, like, speaking clear and not speaking nervously or quietly? \nseryue: I still have this problem myself actually! Controlling my voice is one of the things I\u2019m still trying to improve. So far I\u2019ve found that nervous speaking is deterred by a slow and steady pace, making sure to take breaths in between sentences ! It\u2019s better to be a bit slow than to be too fast after all, I\u2019ve been told people sometimes struggle to keep up with me lol\nThis also applies to volume, if you\u2019re afraid that a large group of people can\u2019t hear you don\u2019t be afraid to go a little louder, chances are that you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re shouting but it\u2019s because your own ears are the closest pair to your voice \n\nSometimes i find that my voice shakes when i speak and it\u2019s definitely very hard to control. It sounds repetitive but steady breathing helps a lot! I\u2019ve even heard professional speakers\u2019 voice shake in front of crowds at school, definitely do not feel bad if it happens to you because even the pros get it sometimes!\n\nAnother tactic i found was useful is to pretend like you\u2019re acting as someone else, smile even if you feel scared and act like you know what you\u2019re doing even if you don\u2019t. No one else can tell your fake confidence from your real confidence ! \u201cFake it till you make it\u201d has become my new motto for speaking in front of crowds. Similarly i also keep  in mind the phrase \u201cif you act like you know what you\u2019re doing, no one will question you\u201d. I\u2019ve found it helps me put on that \u201calter ego\u201d act a little better. Also!

{"full_text": "Sliated: CMV: The Electoral College Should be Replaced with a National Vote Using Score Voting\n  \n\nFrom everything that I have seen, switching the U.S.\u2019s voting system from an electoral college using plurality voting (meaning that whoever gets the most votes wins), to a national score voting system (where all candidates are given a score from 1 to 10, with everyone\u2019s scores added up) would be hugely beneficial to the country for the following reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I\u2019d argue that one of the biggest flaw with the U.S.\u2019s current voting system is the frequency that voters feel as though they need to vote for \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d. When it\u2019s time to vote for the president, you only have three options: vote for the democrat candidate, vote for the republican candidate, or have your vote not count. While it is possible to vote for a candidate that you may like much more than the democrat and republican finalists, you might as well not vote at all. This is due to something called the spoiler effect, where if there are similar candidate, the votes get split between them. This is because you only have the ability to vote for a single candidate in an election, so the best strategy for an individual is to use it on one of the two candidates who is most likely to win.\n\nWith score voting, you\u2019d be able to vote in a way that more accurately reflects your true opinions towards the candidates. You\u2019d be able to give a third party a higher rating than any of the other candidates, while still showing preference towards a democratic or republican candidate over the other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. When our current system of plurality voting is compared to the other primary methods of counting votes, the voters will, on average, have candidates that they approve of less. On the flip side, score voting results in the average highest approval of any other voting method. (source: [https://tinyurl.com/y6bptoz7](https://tinyurl.com/y6bptoz7) ) People defending the electoral college like to bring up that it has almost always elected a president that was in line with the popular vote, though this is in comparison to a national popular vote using the plurality system, meaning that the electoral college is slightly worse than one of the worst voting systems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. \u201cTyranny of the majority\u201d is frequently used as an argument against direct democracy, or just democracy in general, with the example of two wolves and a sheep deciding on what\u2019s for dinner. The issue with this is that the electoral college does not fix this issue, and can even make matters worse. Let\u2019s expand on that example to see what voting system protects the sheep the best.\n\nLet\u2019s say that we have three states: A, B, and C. Each state has only three citizens, which are some mixture of either wolves or sheep. Now imagine that state A has three wolves, and states B and C each have one wolf. In a direct democracy, it would be 5 wolves vs. 4 sheep, meaning that the sheep would get eaten. If the election used an electoral college, we would have 1 wolf state vs. 2 sheep states, meaning that the sheep would be safe.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that prove that the electoral college works? Well, in that scenario it does, but imagine the same example, but with the wolf and sheep populations swapped. In the direct democracy, the sheep would be safe, but in an electoral system, the sheep would get eaten. The electoral college can only avoid the \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d by occasionally flipping the election results from what a pure democracy would have been. This flip will help as often as it hurts.\n\nNow, if we were to use score voting, we can imagine the sheep giving 0 points to having sheep for dinner, and 10 points to having something else, as it is life and death for them. The wolves might give 7 points to having sheep, and 3 points to having something else, as they would still prefer sheep, but having something else wouldn\u2019t be too much worse. In a popular vote of just two wolves vs a single sheep, the sheep dinner would get a total score of 14 (7 + 7 + 0), while something else would get a total score of 16 (10 + 3 + 3), thereby saving the sheep. If you were to switch the number of wolves and sheep, the sheep would still be safe, which cannot be said for the electoral college.\n\nNow, that is if the animals were honest in their votes; if they were strategic, the wolves would give 10 points to a sheep dinner, and 0 points to something else, meaning that the sheep would still get eaten. This strategic use of score voting essentially becomes approval voting, which still offers a significant increase in group satisfaction over plurality. Score voting can\u2019t solve all issues, but it can solve many more than our current system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. One other commonly touted benefit of the electoral college is that it promotes getting a wide range of support across the entire U.S., instead of just the population centers. There are several issues with this reasoning. First of all, this equates geography with political interests too highly. While each state does have different interests, not all of these interests are uniform. For example, a candidate were only to focus on the biggest states, both Rhode Island and Utah would be ignored, but the candidate would end up representing Rhode Island much better than Utah, because of how similar Rhode Island is to the big states, and how dissimilar Utah is to any other state.\n\nNext, if you want candidates to give attention to all of the states and not just the biggest population centers in the country, then they will focus on the biggest population centers in each state. The (unobtainable) goal of focusing on the entire country is driven by the desire to win over a diverse population of voters, but the irony is that the biggest population centers are the most diverse places in the country. If a candidate wanted to focus their campaigning to win over more voters in a population center that they already had majority support in, they would need to win over different kinds of voters, just as if they were to go campaign in more rural parts of the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Another proposed benefit of the electoral college is that it serves as a separation of power. However, I\u2019d argue that it is the opposite, as the individual power of each voters is consolidated by the much smaller group of electors. In a popular vote, you would need to persuade millions of people to vote for you to win, but in the electoral college, you would only need to do that for 270 people. Additionally, a state\u2019s electors are almost always entirely unknown to the voters in that state, so the voters, who are truly voting for the electors as opposed to the actual president, don\u2019t actually even know who they are voting for. Lastly, states can ultimately just ignore the votes of their citizenry, and assign whatever slate of electors that they choose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look forward to seeing your responses!\nyyzjertl: Score voting is a bad idea for two reasons. First, it can effectively disenfranchise the innumerate: people who lack a basic understanding of numbers will be unable to score candidates according to their actual preferences. It can even be confusing to voters who _do_ understand numbers, but don't understand what it means to assign a score to a candidate. Second, it is vulnerable to tactical voting. A minority of strategically voting voters can overpower the preferences of an honestly ranking majority.\n\nA Condorcet method is much superior to score voting.\nSliated: I\u2019d say that score voting isn\u2019t all that hard to understand, and we already use it a lot in our daily live (e.g. Amazon reviews). If you asked someone to rate something on a scale from 1 to 10, I seriously doubt even a percentage of the voting population would be confused by that.\n\nEven if strategic voting became an issue in a score voting system, it people would adapt to this, and largely treat it as approval voting, which still gets much better results than plurality voting.\n\nI was previously in favor of the Condorcet method, though it does have some significant issues. The main one is its poor performance with strategic voters. I\u2019d argue that it is also harder to understand than either plurality or score voting (both in terms of placing and counting the votes). Additionally, it would be harder to implement in current voting machines than score voting.\n[deleted]: &gt; The main one is its poor performance with strategic voters. I\u2019d\n\nSurely this is a good thing not a bad thing?\nSliated: By poor performance, I mean that the Condorcet method elects candidates that, on average, are found to be less satisfactory to the voting base when compared to score voting. I\u2019d argue that voter satisfaction is the most important criteria for voting.\n[deleted]: but that's only true if you take score voting as a true reflection of satisfaction, which given the strong incentives in score voting to vote disingenuously you cannot. Also the condorcet winner will always be, by definition, the most generally acceptable candidate to the electorate as a whole. Score voting only gives greater satisfaction results by ascribing quantities to the amount of satisfaction people have: it doesn't make more people satisfied it just makes some people more satisfied... allegedly. So condorcet gives better overall satisfaction.\n\nEdit: having read your other comment I now understand what you're saying here. I think you're making two mistakes. Firstly you're comparing apples and oranges. Since a rational voter would vote honestly under condorcet and strategically under score voting those are the satisfactions you should look at. The \"satisfaction of a strategic voter under condorcet\" is not something you need to worry about, as there's no need to vote strategically under condorcet and so the only people who do so are people who do not understand how the system works - they will learn to understand it in time (indeed: small wonder they are not satisfied, it would be very unsatisfying to vote strategically in an election where you didn't have to and are not rewarded for doing so). Your second error is this idea of being able to quantify satisfaction in terms other than the condorcet criterion which I deal with in my other comment.\nSliated: A separate survey is conducted after the voting to determine how satisfied people were with the candidate that one the election, with these surveys not having any impact on the election, and only existing for data collection. Additionally, these satisfaction scores were generated using a simulation, where each issue represents a different axis on a grid, and each voter and candidate are a point on that grid, with the distance between the voters and the winning candidate can be objectively calculated, and are used to determine how satisfied the voters were (source: [https://rangevoting.org/UniqBest.html](https://rangevoting.org/UniqBest.html) )\n\nThe Condorcet winner is preferred over every other candidate to the voting base when, though this does not indicate the magnitude of the voters\u2019 preference. To show this, I\u2019ll go back to the example of the two wolves and one lamb voting on what to have for dinner. Eating the lamb would have two votes, and eating something else would win one vote, so eating lamb would be the winning choice; and as there are only two choices here, it would also be a Condorcet winner. However, if we were to use score voting the Lamb would indicate significant preference towards eating something else, and the wolves would only show a mild preference towards eating lamb, which would result in something else being eaten instead of the lamb. Now, if the wolves were to vote strategically and show the maximum preference towards eating lamb, the lamb would get eaten, but the point here is that score voting is the only system where the lamb would have a chance of winning at all (without also flipping the win to the wolves in certain scenarios).\n[deleted]: Thanks. I'm aware of the methodology you outline in the first para and don't see how it is relevant to the point made.\n\nThe Lamb has no chance of surviving because the wolves would vote strategically, why wouldn't they?\n", "prompt": "Sliated: CMV: The Electoral College Should be Replaced with a National Vote Using Score Voting\n  \n\nFrom everything that I have seen, switching the U.S.\u2019s voting system from an electoral college using plurality voting (meaning that whoever gets the most votes wins), to a national score voting system (where", "orig": "all candidates are given a score from 1 to 10, with everyone\u2019s scores added up) would be hugely beneficial to the country for the following reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

That statistic changed my mind because - despite my initial preconceptions - I could simply not think of any way that 1/3 of African-American men commit prison-worthy crimes.  If the number had been much smaller, I could have gone on assuming that judicial racism was a minor factor.  But 1/3 means it has to be a large and disturbing factor.\nchampionofobscurity: &gt;&gt;That statistic changed my mind because - despite my initial preconceptions - I could simply not think of any way that 1/3 of African-American men commit prison-worthy crimes\n\nDid you question how the arrived at that number though? Because what percentage of that 1/3 is a bunch of dudes sleeping off their booze in the drunk tank? &lt;&lt; That matters, because those individuals do not accurately reflect the issue that is trying to be displayed. It fits under a broad point, with a narrow definition.\nGnosticGnome: No, that's prison and not jail.  I.e. went to trial and was convicted.  If we include jails it's even higher.  See [here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ascii/LLGSFP.TXT) for a slightly outdated version.\nchampionofobscurity: You're getting hung up on the specific thing you mentioned, My argument is that most people will look deeper. and find an component they disagree with.\nGnosticGnome: Maybe, but I personally couldn't.  I couldn't think of any plausible thing to quibble on.  Were prisoners lying to their wardens and claiming to be black?  Surely that's super rare.  Were people sneaking out of jail, getting a new false identity, then getting convicted with the new identity?  Again, surely super rare.  Do we systematically undercount the number of African-Americans present in the country?  Maybe a little.\n\nAnyway, I'm just giving you an example of a statistic that changed my mind.  I assume you just want anecdotes, right?  Or were you hoping for a social statistic on the number of people who say social statistics change their minds?  \nchampionofobscurity: I'm not looking for a statistic, nor am I looking for anecdotes.\n\nI am looking for perhaps someone who can shed light on the reality of social studies and show that my point of view or frame of reference is incorrect. \nGnosticGnome: The reality is that \"social science\" is a very broad field.  It contains crap that merely reflects the biases of those producing it, and it contains experimental designs that have to work because a lot is at stake and the people funding it care only about consistent results.\n\nIf you are just looking at academic journals where researchers are incentivized by publication count, of course you'll find a lot of shoddy work.  If you look at focus groups assembled by expensive advertising firms or political consultants, you aren't as likely to find that.  There may exist some companies and candidates that just want an echo chamber, but many demand (and reward) consistent results that help them narrowly tailor messages to specific groups.  If the approach in Racine should differ from the approach in Peoria, they want to know and quantify that.  And there are (dark-side?) social scientists who will help them do it.  A pragmatic CEO or candidate will not just trust her own assumptions about Peoria but will want those studies to change her view and make sure it matches reality on the ground.\n\nIt's of course not just market research.  I mean, before you place a Starbucks or a middle school, you want to know what is happening to the demographics of that area.

Unless you're playing with dry sand which is lame. \n\n\nI saw this and thought, gee look at the lengths this person went to because his neighbors are irresponsible. \nILoveLampz: How are his neighbors irresponsible for owning a cat?\n[deleted]: I love all animals including cats, but I don't feel like they should get a pass just because they are cats. Why is letting your animal roam freely and unsupervised acceptable behavior? Can you give me another example in which people find this okay? \n\nYou're responsible for your animal. If you wanted to be a part time caretaker you could volunteer at a shelter. \n\n\nEdit: this isn't about cats, this is about cat owners. \nILoveLampz: This sounds like an extremely sheltered mentality. Cats literally evolved with humans because they roamed around our property and killed rats/mice. They stayed because we fed them. \n\nKeeping them locked up in a house is a far worse fate than your kid accidentally grabbing a turd while building a sandcastle.\n[deleted]: &gt;Cats literally evolved with humans because they roamed around our property and killed rats/mice. They stayed because we fed them.\n\nSo did dogs... Are you okay with people letting their dog roam the streets? \n\nI don't think the argument that \"they evolved this way\" really holds a lot of meaning unless you don't consider yourself responsible for your pet. The environment has also changed significantly. Letting them roam in rural country is pretty different. \n\n\nAlso, I'm curious why you think I'm sheltered. I didn't get that. \nILoveLampz: Dogs can bite/kill you, cats can't. Your comparing apples to oranges. If your in a downtown apartment, no you can't let them roam free. If you have a backyard you can set up a tent in, then I'm assuming you have the ability to set up a kitty litter box and let them see some sun once in a while.\n[deleted]: &gt;I'm assuming you have the ability to set up a kitty litter box and let them see some sun once in a while.\n\n\nPlease quote me where I have said that you can't let your cat outside. You can absolutely let your pet outside. The whole point behind this is you should keep an eye on what they are doing. This is where the responsibility part comes in.\n\n\n&gt; Dogs can bite/kill you, cats can't. Your comparing apples to oranges.\n\nYes, and we're not comparing how dangerous these animals are. We are discussing the level of responsibility the owner has over the pets actions. \n\n\nI guess its okay for small dogs to roam freely since they can't kill you?\nILoveLampz: I don't think we'll get anywhere with this argument. I grew up with cats and dogs, and open garage, sandbox, and they could do whatever they want. I grew up in a neighborhood where everyone let their cats roam free, and never heard a negative thing about it. We probably have opposite experiences and yours help you justify your argument the same as my own.\n[deleted]: Nope, our experiences are similar. You probably don't hear about it often because it is to some degree a pointless argument. Cat owners don't really care.  So what can people really do about it? They just accept it.\n\n\nI just think its hilarious that some how people think that responsibility for their pet stops at their door. Sort of a out of sight out of mind situation. On top of that they wouldn't allow it for anything else. Its hard to believe someone can think their pet crapping in a childrens play pen that isn't even your own is okay. \ngreg19735: They wouldn't allow it for anything else because the other situations are ridiculous. Cats, dogs and other pets are all different.\n\nAnd really who cares? People can be great owners for their cat and let them roam around outside. I've never owned a cat and never had an issue with other people's cat.\n[deleted]: So its okay for someone elses pet to crap in this kids sand box? \n\nWe're not talking about the differences between kinds of pets. We are talking about responsibility for a pets actions, regardless of what kind of pet it is. \ngreg19735: no, it's not. but that's basically one of the few things that might happen.\n\nAlso, there's plenty of other wild animals. A responsible owner covers the sand box regardless. Deers, foxes, squirrels and other stuff are also out there so the sandbox is probably going to be covered. \n[deleted]: A responsible person shouldn't have to protect against or clean up after someone elses pet.

The story portrays it like college was out of the question because of money, but i know tons of people who who couldn't afford college so they took out loans. Also a poor girl with stellar grades from the ghetto would be a prime candidate for financial aid. Another story ran on NPR the other day about how poor high acheivers should always aim for the best schools they can because their chances of getting financial aid are very good, and their earnings potential after graduation will be much higher so they can pay off any loans they have. The story centered around a Hispanic girl from the middle of nowhere who was very poor but a high acheiver in school, and she applied and was accepted to Dartmouth with financial aid so she only had to pay 5,000$ per year. The girl Melanie in this story was in the same boat, but i feel her bad attitude was what stopped her ultimately. \nProfessorRiffs: Maybe she's smart enough to not take out student loans?\nnotgod: Sometimes you have to take some risks. If a person knows what they want to do before college age, then go for it. Pour your heart and soul into your \"thing\" that you found to value so much, without the loans. But for the rest of us, we have the option to taking out the loans to expand our capabilities and maybe figure something else out what we want to do. There's always the option of not taking out loans when you don't have a \"thing\" but it will be more difficult to climb the economic ladder. That's almost assuming your goal is to climb the ladder, you are entirely entitled to not - you can stay exactly where you are or drop down a few rungs if you choose to not climb. \nOriginalStomper: &gt;Sometimes you have to take some risks.\n\nAgreed.  But the risks are disproportionately greater and more intimidating when you are a poor person of color with more chance the risk will not pay off and NO financial safety net.\nnotgod: If you're already poor and no way to pay it off - what is there to lose making an attempt? \nOriginalStomper: When you are poor with no credit, not paying your bills means getting evicted.  Not paying bills is serious.  The underprivileged know that the system works against them -- why should they believe they can take on debt with no adverse consequences?  How would they know?\nnotgod: Because then you're stuck in the same spot for the rest of your life. Pay the important bills, work with the billing company to get into a payment plan, get your shit turned off. Otherwise you're stuck. I'd rather try and fail then just spend my life doing the same thing. Read some biographies of people that have made it, they went for broke and succeeded by taking chances. Society wants you to keep paying your bills, fall in line, be average. If you're fine with that, good, if not, otherwise start making some changes and take some risks. Nobody is going to give you success. \nOriginalStomper: Stuck in the same spot struggling to pay rent and keep the utilities on is at least familiar for these people, and far less scary than being homeless.\n", "prompt": "unquietwiki: Three Miles: when kids from the poorest congressional district, see what the rich kids have for schooling\n\nRobotPigOverlord: I listened to this and i have a question:\nThe girl Melanie was poor, however, what was stopping her from applying to colleges and just taking out student loans?", "orig": "The story portrays it like college was out of the question because of money, but i know tons of people who who couldn't afford college so they took out loans.

I feel very alone, like I am an alien, nobody would find anything interesting about me. I constantly suffer under these pathetic feelings, want to fight and come out of this shit life. Forgetting things has became a habit for me. I can't really focus. I don't have that zeal to do things. Sorry for the bad english but that's all I want to say. Thanks for reading this.\nZavke: I would suggest 2 things here (in order):\n\n1) Go into therapy. It\u2019ll do wonders to discuss this with a professional and a good one will be able to guide you, teach you techniques and so much more\n\n2) Get a hobby for introverts. There are a lot of hobbies out there that you can do mostly on your own but where social interaction with likeminded people is possible. I\u2019m not saying that all of the people there will be introverts but very often they have wholesome communities that are extremely accepting to all individuals. \n\nSome examples (from personal experience) is the Goth community (but stay very clear from the Emo community as they can be very toxic) and the Warhammer miniature (creating/painting/playing) community. Just avoid any competitive gaming.\nhikingaustin: I myself don't like indulging in gaming shit and all cause it's not productive at all. I am looking for a community where people are creative enough and have visions. I want barrage of energy that could drive me like a human being not like a bot. I want to talk to people and understand them more clearly ( I am a very self centred guy) be it a girl or a guy. I want to feel alive I am dead right now.\nZavke: Wow, quite an aggressive answer from a self proclaimed introvert. Get of your high horse judging communities you haven\u2019t experienced for yourself and calm down because it sounds like you want to be able to run without even knowing how to crawl first. \n\nJust ignore my second point, you desperately and urgently need therapy in order to function like a normal person in society.\nhikingaustin: I am sorry I don't meant to be rude there. But you are the only one who understood what's wrong with me (very happy that you understood me). Yeah I need to be calm first. What should I do? I blurt out random things. My thoughts are not even organised. You said rightly I don't think and act like a normal human being. My emotions are dead. I pinpoint small things out (I constantly search for perfection in others but I am callous myself) , I judge others badly (but I won't say to them). I am insane but I am not a bad guy at all.\nZavke: I wouldn\u2019t call you insane by any means. In fact your story/situation reminds me of one I\u2019ve experienced myself and seen happen to multiple people that I know. Don\u2019t focus on the end goal but try to enjoy the journey, otherwise you\u2019ll just remain frustrated and unfulfilled since reaching those goals will just leave you feeling empty afterwards (again, speaking from experience)\n\nTake my advice and get therapy. It\u2019s the gonna be hard work (I won\u2019t sugarcoat it) but it remains the fastest and easiest way to a better life and better you. \n\nThere are other ways but they will require much more personal discipline that you seem to be able to muster at the moment. \n\nAnd never underestimate the positive influence of a wholesome community, one of the first things you will have to let go of are any preconceived notions and prejudices you have against anyone and any thing.\n", "prompt": "hikingaustin: Be in my shoe and help me\nI am 22 years old, had a very hard time growing up.

Chestflys are also great for lower pec isolation but they are uncomfertable for me.

And your question about if this is hitting majority of major muscle groups yes i thinkso but lmk what you think i could improve because there's always room to improve.

See comments!\n\nEDIT2: spoke too soon. reduced the frequency of the alarm but didn't eliminate it.  It alarms even when the hoses are simply dangling into a bucket, but less often\n\nPictures of the current setup here http://imgur.com/gallery/rCs8R\n\nThe unit is a Rheem \"Prestige\" heat pump water heater.\n\nWhen I originally hired a plumber to install the heater, he used PVC pipe for both the primary and secondary condensate line outs, connected together further downstream with a tee.\n\nThe water heater alarmed that a condensate line was blocked so I removed the fixed PVC piping and replaced them with transparent vinyl tubing with removable garden-hose style connectors so I could see what's happening.  I manually poured water down the line to confirm they're not blocked.  Everything drains smoothly.\n\nI let the vinyl hoses hang off of the unit into a bucket for a few days, rather than the normal drain, and the unit never alarmed while gradually filling the bucket with water.  But now that I connect them to the drain pipe it alarms.  There's no obvious water blockage.\n\nCould it have something to do with the pressure of being looped into a longer, narrower PVC drain pipe (third picture)?   Seems unlikely but I'm out of ideas.\n\nWater is definitely not backing up into the unit.\n\nAny other things to try?\nMattRRead: is there an \"air gap\" where the drain terminates?\nmbacarella: I think so.  The drain drops on top of a sump pit and the sump pump definitely works; I can hear it run when I pour water into the drain.\n\nIt's remotely possible that once in awhile the place where the drain pipe terminates is below the water level in the sump pit.  I didn't double check that (it's in my crawl space so a bit of a PITA to get to).\n\nIt's like at the end of 15 feet of piping though.\n\nWhat's your assumption here?  Are you thinking having the pipe below the water level in the sump pit can put enough back pressure on the condensate line to make the sensor think it's blocked?\n\nThe alarm does go off intermittently.  I wonder if it only alarms for as long as the pit is full, and then when the pump clears the pit it clears the alarm in the water heater.\nRebuildingABungalow: Exactly.  The pressure is stopping water flow so It\u2019s like you\u2019ve got a clog until the sump dumps. Try replacing your first pvc 90 with a pvc 90 T and run a pipe up from there to create a vent. That might fix it without having to get to the sump. \nmbacarella: https://imgur.com/XQx5v89\n\nDid something similar.\n\nAdded a T immediately downstream from the vinyl T, pointing up, to vent the pressure (didn't want to mess with cutting out and replacing that 90)\n\nSo far so good! Was alarming every 12 hours before adding this.  Now hasn't alarmed in almost 3 days.\nRebuildingABungalow: Nice! Glad to hear it. To finish it off now, I would slap two 90s on that, point it towards the wall and up with a little flat cap with some holes drilled in it. Then boom, it\u2019ll look almost professional. \nmbacarella: Spoke too soon.  Still alarms. Even with the hoses just dangling into a bucket.  Simply takes longer.

But why stop there ? Is time a constraint ?\n\nYou can strengthen pretty much the whole body if you add in progressions for horizontal push(PPPUs) and pull (Tuck lever rows) to your current routine which already has vertical push, pull and legs. You might have to split up the days into push/pull days like in the recommend routine or into verical/horizontal days (my current routine) with rest days inbetween. \n\nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Train everything so that there are no weak links. The choice is upto you though :)\nihatepepperballs: Back and forearms/wrists are my biggest weakness right now, so that's what I'm focusing on.\n\nBy the way: how could I split this into two parts? I would like to do the first half in the morning, then the second one in the afternoon.\n\nThanks for the input :)\nn3ox1ne: Its a 2 day split. For example, Monday would be horizontal day with pushups/rows/core. Tuesday would be rest day and Wednesday would be vertical day with pullups/dips(will move to hspu after getting good stable handstands)/legs. Thursday would be rest and Friday would be horizontal again and it just repeats like that every day, rest, train, rest.\n\nThis is my personal routine modified from the recommend one. It makes sense to me and works for me. It might be different for you. Stick to the recommend routine for 2 or 3 months atleast and then make changes if needed. Good luck and enjoy this journey :D\nihatepepperballs: I feel like that's too much rest time, especially for a teenager. I want action, dammit :D\n\nAre you sure it would be more beneficial to split it into two days when I could do the whole thing in one?\nn3ox1ne: Your recovery time will have to increase especially after progressing to the intermediate movements. The tendons and joints will need more rest between sessions. Otherwise you will overtrain the body and get injured. Remember this is not a race. Take it slow and stay injury free. This is all my opinion though.

This company has shown itself entirely willing to use their platform to manipulate their users' emotional state. \n\nIn that context, *how* they use the data and in what way they target and present ads *should* be a concern for everyone.

You're susceptible to things that humans are. Small things can have great effect without you knowing. You're not bulletproof. \nGrommmit: They may have *an* effect, but the news stories that Facebook delivers me does not dictate my emotional state. If their aim is to make me roll my eyes 3 or 4 times a day, they achieve that.

Seems a bit backwards to me.\nPerryDigital: You're nieve to believe the human mind is as simple as you choosing to not believe Facebook and thinking that any influence over you is done with. There are much more subtle things at play. Think about how people like Derren Brown work. Imagine being shown stories that keep subtly nodding towards a certain colour.

Most academics today dislike that definition, for (in my experience) most of them don't actually love wisdom but instead find philosophical puzzles/problems fun and interesting. \nRed_Marcus: This touches on what I'm wrestling with, we use science, mathematics and historical research to build theories of knowledge for ourselves as well, so can those be considered part of philosophy? I know philosophy used to encompass all areas of inquiry until it was broken down into individual academic disciplines like mathematics, economics, psychology and political science, etc...\n\nI am picturing a Venn Diagram in my head of the different disciplines and where philosophy intersects with mathematics and economics and what have you.\n\nSo would you consider science, mathematics, economics etc... necessary tools to use in philosophy? How would the majority of academics define it?\nJurgioslakiv: We don't actually use the sciences etc to build theories of knowledge. We use them to build knowledge sets, but not to answer the question, \"What is knowledge?\" Philosophy tries to figure out what counts as knowledge, what are the requirements for something to be true, etc, which is quite different from what the sciences and other areas of study are doing.\n\nAt the core of every discipline lies philosophy though. At some point every discipline relies on philosophical tenets and axioms in order to start. The sciences for instance, rely on certain claims established in philosophy of science. So to that extent it's not as much that philosophy needs to use math, science, economics etc, but rather that all of those disciplines inherently use philosophy at their core.\nRed_Marcus: ok, so philosophy provides us with the axioms we need to actually do the other disciplines.\n\nThe example I was thinking of Karl Marx's political philosophy. He developed a utopian system in his head, but had he used more empirical data or deductive reasoning (which doesn't deductive still count as philosophy?), maybe he would have trashed his model.\n\nSo I'm trying to understand to what extent philosophy is considered the establishment of axioms to build other areas of inquiry off of, and to what extent philosophy builds models off of these axioms. \"What is truth?\" would be considered axiomatic level and \"overthrow the proletariat\" is based off of many more assumptions, but they are both considered philosophy. \nyelbesed: As the marxist theories have caused hundreds of millions of death and oppression in his name I would not use him when I start out to define philosophy. In spite of some kind of rebel popularity of it in some corners.\nRed_Marcus: Yeah maybe that was in bad taste. Don't take it the wrong way, I love capitalism.

{"full_text": "Kavec: What if PETA was wrong and its consequences.\nI am talking about the typical discussion: why People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) do not want people to harm animals but they are OK with eating plants.\n\nThe answers about that are akin to \"duh! killing a plant is not the same thing as killing an animal!\", but they kind of avoid the interesting points:\nhttp://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/why-is-it-ok-to-eat-plants-and-not-animals/\n\nNevertheless this article hits the nail on the head when it enunciates the subject of the discussion:\n\n&gt; But what if we don\u2019t know enough about plants? It\u2019s easy to understand why this discussion could lead someone who enjoys eating meat and other animal products to conclude that we might as well eat animals, since not eating them could lead us down a ridiculous slippery slope where we might not be able to eat anything. Such a conclusion, unfortunately amounts to nothing more than an excuse to justify our consumption of animals. \n\nMy guess on the matter is a little bit difficult for me to explain but I'll do my best (specially not being English my mothertongue, not at all):\n\nLots of people are able to stare at a dead fish and feel nothing, but when they see a dead dog and they feel realy bad. I think this happens because for an average human it is easier to relate to a mammal than to a fish, both being ~~human~~ living beings. What if we go farther away from the mammals. What if we talk about plants: we feel a little bit bad if a big tree is cut down, because some of us can relate to that as we are both of us human beings. But I think most of us agree that this reaction is, in average, a lot less stressful than someone cutting a dog in front of us.\n\nWe can observe in life that dying is most likely an stressful experience for all living beings, in some way or another. Keeping that in mind, let's go even farther: bacteria, body cells, etc. One might presume that they fight against death as furiously as a person who is drowning and is fighting for some air. Does it mean that antibiotics are unethical?\n\nFor me the solution to this puzzle is to change the formulation of \"Ethical Treatment\" (as in PETA) which is usually understood as \"avoiding pain\" to other living beings. IMO, what we really want to avoid is **our own pain**. Thus if you allow other humans to get hurt, you feel you will be likely to get hurt as well. Same thing goes with animals: if you allow people to hurt animals which we relate to, it is easy that these people get insensible also to human suffering. With plants this risk is very little, this is why PETA would not care about people eating vegies.\n\nDoes it make sense? Any ideas on the matter?\n\n---\n\n**Edit**: I agree with the general argument that \"plants have no nervous system\", but I still would not be sure that this means that they have no feelings. I would like to add some relevant information to this discussion:\n\nVery relevant: TED Talk, The roots of plant intelligence http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/stefano_mancuso_the_roots_of_plant_intelligence.html\n\nAskscience: Are bugs able to feel pain? http://ww.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ib81m/are_bugs_able_to_feel_pain/\n\n**Edit2**: I am not saying that it is OK to be cruel to animals. Not in the least. I am just wondering if the typical moral arguments that support it are flawed, and discussing some alternatives.\n\nIn the ancient times, people would not consider a tree as a living being. Now we do. Some centuries ago almost no one would believe that animals had feelings. Now we do. Our understanding and perception about the matter varies over the time.\nbobbaphet: The consequences would be irrelevant, even if plants had feelings. The reason why is because it would be completely unreasonable to not eat plants. The typical moral argument is not flawed even if plants did have feeling because the only other alternative would be to starve yourself to death, *which is completely and totally unreasonable*. Only an insane person would think otherwise. Whether or not plants have feelings is irrelevant.\njohnbentley: &gt; even if plants did have feeling because the only other alternative would be to starve yourself to death, which is completely and totally unreasonable.\n\nWhat if the plants where not only conscious but self conscious?\nbobbaphet: So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\njohnbentley: Yes.\n\nIf you develop a condition where you need a heat transplant, and none are available from the organ donor list, it would be immoral to kill another (adult) human so that you might live. The wrongness doesn't lie in species membership, it lies in that other (adult) humans are self conscious.\nbobbaphet: &gt;Yes.\n\nwhich is completely and totally unreasonable. Only an insane person would think otherwise.\n\njohnbentley: But you don't address the heart transplant case.\nbobbaphet: Yes, I usually don't address irrelevant things.\njohnbentley: Why is it not relevant?\nbobbaphet: Because regardless of what is true, not eating plants is not an option, unless you are insane and suicidal...\njohnbentley: That is possibly the most intellectually dishonest response I've come across.\nbobbaphet: \"Yes you should not eat plants if they are conscious\", is what the most intellectually dishonest response is. That is totally ludicrous!\njohnbentley: I never made that claim, and that you are back there demonstrates your intellectual dishonesty.\nbobbaphet: Yes you did. \n\nI said: \"So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\" \n\nYour response was: \"Yes\". \n\nYou are the one being intellectually dishonest here. Or perhaps you just forgot you said that? \n\n\n\njohnbentley: I forgot nothing. Your recent reference \"if they are conscious\", not \"if they were self conscious\".\n\n\n\n\nbobbaphet: So if they are conscious OR self conscious, we should starve ourselves to death?...Nonsense either way.\njohnbentley: That this is not my view is further evidence of your intellectual laziness.\nbobbaphet: If that is the case, then you should have not said \"Yes\" to the question...\njohnbentley: I answered \"Yes\" to\n\n&gt; So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\n\nI didn't answer yes to \n\n&gt; if they are conscious OR self conscious, we should starve ourselves to death?\n\nI'd like to know what criteria you have for judging it morally permissible to take or save a life. If it species membership then we have nothing left to discuss.\nbobbaphet: &gt;I answered \"Yes\" to So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\n\nExactly, which is completely and totally ridiculous...\n.\njohnbentley: It may well be ridiculous but the intellectually honest course is to say why. One way to say why is to show why some other criteria is the right, and vastly superior, one.\nbobbaphet: &gt;It may well be ridiculous but the intellectually honest course is to say why.\n\nBecause you are advocating **committing suicide**..**.Which is insane**... I thought that part was obvious...but I guess not... Get back to me when you want to have a **reasonable** discussion...\njohnbentley: But I addressed the argument from committing suicide (in the sense of letting yourself die rather than kill others) in the heart transplant case. You ignored it. You seem to be a bigot, having entrenched ideas that you shy away from examining.\nbobbaphet: I ignored it because it's irrelevant because committing suicide is literally insane... Like I said, I am only interested in reasonable discussions. You are simply being unreasonable. \njohnbentley: So you think a healthy person should be killed so their organs should be distributed to save the lives of others (who will die without the new organs) so they don't have to commit suicide (the sense in which you are using \"commit suicide\")?\n\nIf that is your position it is unorthodox and immoral.\nbobbaphet: Nope, no one should be killed to save another, unless you are talking about committing suicide because you don't want to kill plants...talk about unreasonable...\njohnbentley: &gt; Nope, no one should be killed to save another.\n\nRight, then why would it be right to kill a plant, who counts as one if they are self conscious, to save the lives of others?\n\nIf they don't count as one in virtue of self consciousness what criteria do you use before a being counts as deserving the right to life?\nbobbaphet: I already answered that but you just can't understand it...\njohnbentley: Point to your answer.\nbobbaphet: &gt;because committing suicide is literally insane...\njohnbentley: But you are happy for those who have faulty organs to commit suicide rather than kill another for their healthy organs.\n\nYou believe your own position to be insane.\nbobbaphet: That is quite literally the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard...\njohnbentley: That's question begging.\nbobbaphet: No it isn't. It's my opinion of your statements...\njohnbentley: The question is (at least one form of it) \"Why is self consciousness as a criteria for the saving or taking of life wrong?\"\n\nJust asserting that self consciousness is the wrong criteria (by calling it \"insane\") is not anywhere near an attempt to explain why. That is what makes it question begging. \n\nAny attempts by me to have you get at the details end up with you studiously avoiding those details. It is as if you but your fingers in your ears and just shout: \"It's insane, it's insane\". \n\nI illustrate why no one can seriously hold the view in some cases letting your self die ('committing suicide' as you characterise it, a plausible characterisation) rather than take the life of another is morally good. But you persist with \"committing suicide is literally insane\".\nbobbaphet: You're insane. Seek professional help.\njohnbentley: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem\nbobbaphet: If you actually knew what Ad hominem was, you wouldn't be saying that. Ad hominem can only occur in the context of an argument. I was not making an argument, I was just telling you you should seek professional help because you're insane. \njohnbentley: Your response to my argument is to characterise it as so wrong to be evidence of insanity. Your response is paradigmatic ad hominem. Whether I'm insane or not has no bearing on the truth of my claims or the validity of my argument.\nbobbaphet: I don't care about your argument. I'm just saying you're insane. :)\njohnbentley: Then it's a plain old non sequitur.\nbobbaphet: So what?\njohnbentley: It is irrelevant.\nbobbaphet: Yes, your arguments are irrelevant, I agree.\njohnbentley: No your claim of insanity is.\nbobbaphet: No it isn't.\njohnbentley: Yes, this is the meaning of a non sequitur. The conclusion in no way follows from the premises. \nbobbaphet: Is this an actual person talking? or some alien robot computer?\njohnbentley: That still doesn't address the issue. Your intellectual dishonesty is complete. Your next move is to try and claim to be a troll, to make it seem that you really could explain your sincere views if you wanted to.\nbobbaphet: It's wrong to not eat plants because not doing so would kill yourself. What part about that can you not understand? It's quite simple, a 5th grader could understand it. Holy god man...\njohnbentley: But it is not always wrong to kill yourself. The organ case shows that. In the organ case why is it not wrong to kill yourself?\nbobbaphet: Completely false. Dying from a failed organ is not the same as killing yourself. It's dying from a failed organ...\njohnbentley: At last! Some progress!\n\nYou can differentiate \"killing yourself\" or \"commit suicide\" from letting yourself die. If by \"committing suicide\" or \"killing yourself\" you mean taking active steps to end your life then this (edit: is) plausibly different from letting yourself die by failing to act. This second kind of death we could call \"death by omission\".\n\nDying from a failed organ is death by omission, you don't kill another human and you therefore die. So too in the plant case, you don't kill a plant and therefore you die.\n\nBoth cases are death by omission.\n\n\nbobbaphet: You can twist it around however you see fit, your statements are still totally ridiculous. Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: Why would one case by death by omission and not the other?\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\n\nCommon sense: \"sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts.\", \"\"the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way\"\n\nSomething that you are lacking.\njohnbentley: If both cases aren't death by omission (you've been good in allowing the assumption that there are no alternatives to a plant sourced diet) it should be very easy for you to say why, using common sense or whatever you like.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: Repeating that phrase just reveals your unwillingness to address the point made. A point made clearly and plainly. \n\nIt could be because you start to feel the weakness of your own position but I think it more likely that you are unused to the most basic level of intellectual enquiry.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: So if you are very young, you don't have to wait for your faculties to mature to start exercising basic thinking and arguing skills. You could join a local book reading club, for example, in order to become used to addressing and discussing issues. \n\nAt the moment you are incapable of disagreement. That capability ought be your first goal.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\n", "prompt": "Kavec: What if PETA was wrong and its consequences.\nI am talking about the typical discussion: why People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) do not want people to harm animals but they are OK with eating plants.\n\nThe answers about that are akin to \"duh! killing a plant", "orig": "is not the same thing as killing an animal!\", but they kind of avoid the interesting points:\nhttp://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/why-is-it-ok-to-eat-plants-and-not-animals/\n\nNevertheless this article hits the nail on the head when it enunciates the subject of the discussion:\n\n&gt", "generated": "Kavec: What if PETA was wrong and its consequences.

{"full_text": "Crishy65: Core and breathing\nI recently restarted with BWF after a lengthy health and job induced hiatus. Going through the new and improved (I assume) RR, I ran across the Deadbug excercise. For me very timely because I have also become more serious about singing, and a lot of what Nick-E writes in his tutorial, especially the parts about breathing, is exactly what my singing teacher is telling me I need to focus on. It did lead to some questions, though. I wasn't sure whether this was the right sub to ask, but I figured that singers who actually exercised their intrinsic core muscle groups would be here. ;-)  \n1. My primary focus would currently be less core strength and more core endurance. Are there any other core exercises that train endurance or is deadbug all the way to go, just holding longer and longer?     \n2. I have become a bit obsessed with breathing the right away while engaging the core. I tried while running this morning and am not sure I actually got it. Do you guys engage your core when doing cardio type exercises, including avoiding accessory breathing?\nstickysweetastytreat: I train with a few choir singers so this is based on that, not first-hand singing experience.\n\nThe core is composed of multiple layers of muscles. What exactly is your teacher telling you to focus on in singing with your core?\n\nThere is no one right way to breathe all the time. Someone who only does chest/neck breathing 100% of the time can indicate someone who has a lot of trouble letting themselves relax. Someone who only knows to belly breathe means their belly is shifting in &amp; out.. which means not optimal for doing things that require a lot of core stabilization. And of course it isn't so black/white, it's not like \"you absolutely should not do ANY belly breathing when you're doing ANY kind of exercise at all\" Why are you not sure you got the \"right\" engagement when you were running? \n\nAlso-- no matter what, no one's core is completely off (unless there were some underlying condition), the core is supposed to be on at varying degrees throughout daily life activities.\n\nYou might be overthinking things, but I can't say more about that until you explain more about the connections you saw between the dead bug &amp; your singing teacher's comments.\nCrishy65: You are right, I probably am overthinking it. I just figured even if I don't need it, extra exercises for the inner core muscles can't hurt.\n\nThe connection is in the first part of the deadbug tutorial where he talks about correct breathing; I immediately recognized that from my singing lessons.\nstickysweetastytreat: Based on my conversations with them-- my impression was that the difference is when working out, you need to engage your core to keep everything pulled in whereas singing is more being able to let your belly expand and pull back in to maximize the air you can control with your diaphragm.\nCrishy65: That\u2019s correct - which is why I was only looking at the INNER core muscles, i.e. those that you need for that control and why deadbug made so much sense.\nstickysweetastytreat: Having your deep core engaged means everything is compressed in.

And if they do, so what you'll have the emotional stability to deal with someone rejecting you or not liking you.\n\nTo start raising your self-esteem, write down good things about yourself. Listen to the people who love you and who've been there. For example don't discount good things your mom or grandma has to say about you, they're not just saying it because.\nBarcaLiverpool: Very well said!\n\nI have made several significant changes in my lifestyle in order to better myself.

{"full_text": "DancesWithDownvotes: Question about one-armed pushups\nI'd been doing regular pushups but they've gotten easier and easier.\n\nFor reference, I'm a 6'3 male, about 360.  \n\nI tried some one-armed pushups, and they seem to be KILLER.  What I wonder is if I can just switch to doing ONLY one-armed pushups and expect some strength/size gain.  What do you guys think?  Save me the \"you're too big, hurt yourself, safety\" crap.  You know what's ALSO dangerous?  Weighing 408lbs like I did 3 months ago.  And weighing 360lbs now.\n\nThanks so much for the input.\n\nETA:  I apologize that it seems unbelievable.  I'm not here to impress anybody.  I just wanna look the way I want to look one day, and if this'll get me there that'd be great.  Just a question, and you're the closest to experts I can get. :)\n[deleted]: ..have you read the FAQ? I know it doesn't explicitly answer your question, but it should give you some idea of what the answer will be. \n\nFirst off, doing a OAPU at your weight is incredible. So incredible, it's actually kind of hard for me to believe. Although I want to believe this is true, simply because of how incredible it is.\n\nMay I ask how your form was? Straddle or straight legged?\n\nAs for your question, it depends on how many you're capable of doing. If you can only do 2 or 3, you'll have a hard time getting enough volume to make progress, so I would recommend scaling down a progression and working up to 8x3. But if you can do 4 or more, go for it. \nDancesWithDownvotes: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaabsolutely straddle.  Going down I turn  my shoulder down toward my hand, and push back straight coming up.\n\nSo, even though my muscles are dead tired in a similar way to other things I'd done more of, you think 5x3 isn't enough?  Not that I mean to sound like I'm arguing, I guess just being uneducated about these things I wonder what the difference is. \n\nI'll definitely try 8 sets of 3, but I wonder if my chest will hold up. lol\n[deleted]: My bad, I meant 3 sets of 8, on a lower progression.\n\n5 sets of 3 may work, try it and see how your body responds. Eventually you'll want to increase the reps of course. \n\nGood luck. \n\nOne more question, are you currently losing weight? Because I you are, by the time you get down into the 200lb range, you'll be extremely strong both proportionally and in general. \n\n\nDancesWithDownvotes: Doing keto, so it's making lifting a little harder since I'm not doing CKD or whichever it's called, if I can help it.  I've hit a plateau for the last 2 weeks for some reason.  Probably eating too much.  I go to town on baked chicken, man.\n\nHow long do you think some noticeable progress might take?  I know everybody's different, but exercises with the same muscle group I've seen results in 2-3 weeks before.  But these things are beastly, it's hard to see them getting easy any time soon.\n[deleted]: &gt;How long do you think some noticeable progress might take?\n\nThat depends on a lot of things. I can't give you a very accurate estimate without seeing you in person, but I'll do the best with what I've got.\n\nHow long have you been working out? How many times a week do you workout? What's your routine like? How are your sleeping habits? Do you drink/smoke? \nDancesWithDownvotes: I've been focusing chest for 3-4 months now, along with all the work that comes with living on a mountain, cutting down and moving trees, wood, heavy things, etc.  Lots of on the go.\n\nMy routine is optimized around achieving a 5x5, chest/triceps one day, biceps/shoulders the next.  Repeat.  If I get to doing 5x5 without failure I make it harder somehow, which is why I'm here today.\n\nNo drinking/smoking.  Sleep 6-8hrs a day.  \n[deleted]: Ok, given that routine, and the fact that you're still technically a beginner, you should progress relatively quickly.\n\n***But***\n\nYou're routine is imbalanced. This could lead to serious shoulder problems down the road. \n\nFor every pushing movement (e.g. Push-ups, dips) you do, you need a pulling movement (e.g. Pull-ups, rows) to balance it out. This will keep your shoulder from developing imbalances, which can seriously mess them up. Check out the FAQ in the sidebar for examples of exercises, and more info on routines. \nDancesWithDownvotes: I'd heard that about beginner gains, and I've been counting on it.  I've weighed this much for a long time, so maybe having to push ALL this weight around for so long will serve some benefit once I start losing more.\n\nThe whole idea was me noticing that I'd lost weight and how things were getting easier.  But since cancer and chemo, some switches have flipped in my head.  I don't WANT them to be easier, you know?  I feel like if I can keep things hard, I'll keep getting stronger and seeing progress.  I honestly enjoy the challenge...except jogging.  Screw running/jogging.  I hate it.  But it's a necessary pain I guess.\n\nI dunno if genetics help, but dad was a 5'7 ripped beast, and mom's tall and square...so maybe that helps.\n\nI've noticed lots of great things about my body, how it responds to what I give at it and throw at it, it's AMAZING to wake up one day recovered from something I put myself through before.  \n\nI wish I'd cared this much years ago.  But oh well, I deserve to have to take the tough road.  \n\nThanks so much for your help. :)\n[deleted]: &gt;I don't WANT them to be easier, you know?

{"full_text": "Greedy-Diet: The Emerging Right-Wing Vision of Constitutional Authoritarianism\n\n[deleted]: Interesting that the article never actually *disproves* anything that Vermeule is saying.\nPanzerdrek: Vermeule never actually made legal arguments himself. It was pure rhetoric. In fact his very argument relies on wholly rejecting stare decisis which is a cornerstone of law not just in the US but in much of the world and even as far back as Roman law. \n\nThis is really an argument about what law is and what it ought to be. What Vermeule is arguing is essentially for a literal fascist legal system where a strong centralized administrative state dictates morality to the masses via an unregulated executive. That ought to be terrifying to any person that has any love of the central principles of our system of government.\n[deleted]: &gt; Vermeule never actually made legal arguments himself.\n\nNo, but he made philosophical arguments. Carl Schmitt isn't just \"pure rhetoric\", he's a serious thinker, and the challenge he poses to liberalism is profound. There can be no law without authority, and liberalism's rejection of social authority makes it intrinsically incoherent. Liberals can only ever rule either through deception (exercising authority but claiming not to) or else in erratic and self-undermining ways (see: right-libertarian antigovernment nonsense, also the entire radical left-anarchist tradition).\n\n&gt;stare decisis which is a cornerstone of law not just in the US but in much of the world and even as far back as Roman law.\n\nStare decisis doesn't apply during a genuine state of exception, that's Schmitt's whole point.\nPanzerdrek: Except that's a fundamental misreading of liberralism. The fundamental concept of liberralism is that authority resides in the people, and that authority is temporarily granted to leaders in a constrained way, both through the mechanisms of elections *and* rule of law. Vermeule's arguments presents a complete caricature of liberal judicial philosophy ignoring both its history and its moral underpinnings. His argument is at best a rather uncharitable reading of liberralism and just as likely is disingenuous. \n\nThe core conception of the constitutional framework of the US is that power ought to be devolved where practical and constrained where not. It's designed to prevent the very thing Veremuele is advocating for: the tyranny of an executive that imagines itself above the rule of law but able to impose it on everyone else based on principles it conveniently gets to define. It's nothing short of fascism, and much love fascism it claims to attack a mythologized decadence while creating a myth of its own supremacy, while ignoring that it is achieved only through blood and corruption. It ignores the fact that any government is a government of *people*, not some platonic nonsense, and people are deeply, deeply flawed.\n[deleted]: &gt; The fundamental concept of liberralism is that authority resides in the people\n\nNo, that's the fundamental concept of *nationalism*, not liberalism. Liberalism centers fundamentally upon the authority of the autonomous individual will, regards any power from outside this autonomous will as a negative force, and accepts social authority only if absolutely necessary. Liberal political theory is endlessly obsessed with the problem (one unresolvable and fundamentally formulated on a mistake, in my view) of how to keep society together while still protecting \"individual autonomy\" from social influence.\nPanzerdrek: That's not what nationalism is. A state can be nationalist and it can be a dictatorship. Nationalism is just the belief in and promotion of one's nation. Authority need not rest with the people. Fascism for example is nationalist but the power resides in the party.\n\nLiberalism relies on what is commonly called \"the consent of the governed\" and while liberty is paramount, so is equality. And while the concept of liberralism as it's used today had evolved significantly since the days of Locke and Co., It is still a major underpinning of our legal philosophy. Utilitarianism has creeped into the picture more and more over time, but the idea of the consent of the governed isn't in any way \"incoherent.\" Nor is the idea of separation of powers. What it is is *pragmatic*. What \nVermeule is proposing is essentially utopian. It might sound good in theory, but thousands of years of history shows is it's awful in actual practice.\n[deleted]: &gt; Nationalism is just the belief in and promotion of one's nation. Authority need not rest with the people.\n\nThis is just cartoonishly false. The core idea of nationalism is that a primordial national people (defined racially or culturally) exists prior to the state, and this people has a general will that ought to be represented and carried out by a legitimate state.\n\nNationalist dictatorships always claim to be governing in accord with the Will of the People, and if they don't in practice then they strive to manipulate the peoples' will through propaganda, or else label dissenters as not \"truly one of the people\" and eliminate them.\n\nLiberal political theory is fundamentally concerned with protecting individual autonomy. Note the term **\"consent\"** of the governed, which presumes an autonomously willed social contract by all parties free of any distorting social influence. Of course free will doesn't really exist and so liberals disagree endlessly, incoherently, and unresolvably over what constitutes autonomy vs coercion/manipulation, but that's the theory anyway.\n\n&gt;What Vermeule is proposing is essentially utopian. It might sound good in theory, but thousands of years of history shows is it's awful in actual practice.\n\nFor thousands of years of history theocracy was the norm. The Pharaohs, the Chinese emperors, the Roman emperors, medieval kings, Islamic Caliphs, the Sapa Inca and Aztec tlatoani, all claimed more or less absolute authority by divine right. It is liberalism that is the aberration.\nNemoTheElf: Just because it was the norm doesn't mean it was good or effective. There's a major reason (well reasons) why theocracy isn't practiced in any modern nation anymore, and likely won't  ever again.\n[deleted]: &gt; Just because it was the norm doesn't mean it was good or effective.\n\n\"Good\" according to whom? Authority, whether individual, collective, hierarchical, or divine, is necessary to define what is good and bad in the first place. \n\n&gt; There's a major reason (well reasons) why theocracy isn't practiced in any modern nation anymore, and likely won't ever again.\n\nBecause it was replaced by a different political theology: that of nationalism, where \"the people\" take the place of God or the Emperor as lawgiver. This simply locates authority in a different source, it does not denounce authority altogether and claim to base society on the radical absence of social power relations, the way liberalism and leftism does.\nNemoTheElf: &gt; \"Good\" according to whom? Authority, whether individual, collective, hierarchical, or divine, is necessary to define what is good and bad in the first place.\n\nThe elite associated with the religion, generally. High priests, bishops, abbots, whatever the authority of the religion of the time. Not so much for people who aren't part of that religion or don't play a role in the hierarchy. \n\nIt also tends to encourage gross corruption within the hierarchy, so it ends up being bad for the religion long-term anyway.\n\n&gt;Because it was replaced by a different political theology: that of nationalism, where \"the people\" take the place of God or the Emperor as lawgiver.

{"full_text": "thefpnerd: Why are my triceps the only things that hurt???\nOkay, so a bit of context first. I've been doing pushups for years, consistently getting higher in volume, speed and weight (in a backpack) for about 5 years. During the first while I got pain in most places, shoulders, chest and triceps (maybe even lats). Obviously I expect that. After that initial period of time though, I only ever got pain in my triceps? Nothing else hurt anymore, I thought, 'oh it's probably just taking longer to develop' but NO. I refuse to believe after over 4 years of doing this exercise, that my triceps are still \"just weak\", surely there is something wrong right? Anyone else experience this, if so, how did you fix it? It's not the same pain as I get in other muscles or even when I do triceps based excersizes like dips or skullcrushers, it's sharper and js really impeding my performance.\nTop-Conversation678: When you say hurt what do you mean exactly? Pain during workout or the day after when its sore? If you mean pain during workout then just increase the load, if you mean pain from soreness keep in mind that soreness is not a direct indicator of muscle growth infact its the opposite and means you overdid it\nthefpnerd: I mean it's painful at the insertion points of the muscle (so at the base near shoulder and near elbow). It sort of radiates in a straight line down at every rep? I'm at about 50 reps with 10kg on my back, so I'll try increasing load. I still don't think it's normal though?\nTop-Conversation678: That sounds like a medical problem my friend, that or you could be doing the exercise incorrectly, i used to do dips wrong which led to me having elbow pain until I fixed my technique it didnt go away\nthefpnerd: Yeah, I've checked everything on the technique front so it won't be that. I'll call the doctor and see if he can get it checked out, after that, I'll INCREASE THE WEIGHT!!!\n--Lars--: Yeah increase the weight, what could go wrong.\n\nDude, seriously, you are having major troubles and your only thought is after visiting the doctor to increase the weight? Maybe you should recheck here what your goal is because if its wrecking your elbow and your shoulder then you are spot on, everything else not so much.\nthefpnerd: Sir, don't worry, it was a joke. I know that's an idiotic idea and wouldn't have posted here if I didn't feel as though something was more seriously wrong.

Then start off small.\n\nBut if you have been doing large amounts of only pushups every single day for years but not doing anything else. This WILL lead to injury.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: CMV: I don't think physical punishment (whipping/spanking, slapping hands, pulling ears) is ever the proper way to deal with misbehaving children.\n[deleted]\ntwoVices: I'm late to the party on this one, but I feel very strongly about this.\n\ntl;dr: hitting kids is not necessary. Kids are much smarter than most people give them credit for. Negative behavior usually comes from somewhere. The idea that hitting a child who has misbehaved is ok, yet hitting an adult who has misbehaved is cruel and/or unusual just compounds the absurdity. Talk of emergency: kids pick up on the emotional/behavioral cues of the parent.  Mom and dad freaking out and talking loudly, saying no no no will get the point across.\n\nSorry, I'm on my phone, but effective discipline is based, how we do it, on explaining expectations, explaining consequences, and following through with consistency. The \"time out\" is not a punishment, but literally a time for the kid to get out of the poor behavior pattern and begin to relax. Discussion happens going into and coming out of time out. The result, when done calmly and consistently, is a kid who learns how to breathe and think through problems, and then talk them through.\n\nTaking things away would be consequences discussed beforehand. Thus, a choice is given and made to accept the consequence. The actual \"punishment\" part, if the consistency is there, rarely happens. Kids understand by calmly telling them (in age appropriate language) that their behavior isn't ok, and the need to make an adjustment or there will be consequences.\n\nThe toughest part is the consistency. Always being on point and following up with clear expectations, warnings, and consequences is very draining, especially at first.  There is lots of pushback, and lots of time learning how to stand correctly in the corner with discipline.  Once kid realizes that you are going to do what you say, and you have a reason for doing it, they begin to self-regulate.\n\nI have two very willful, rambunctious kids. They can be crazy, but with very little guidance, they shape right up.  I'm very proud of how grown up they behave, yet are totally just kids. I try to treat them as human beings, and try to explain things to them with as little bullshit as possible. Turns out, it's very little.  Kids are whip smart and deserve to be treated with respect.  Hitting is not respectful, and it's just plain unnecessary. \n\n\n\n\nbinlargin: I think it depends on who you are, where you live and how you want your kids to behave in response to situations they encounter in life. If you live in the ghetto and you don't want your kids to be punch bags or fuck toys then they need respect for and command over violence. If you're in the leafy suburbs trying to raise doctors and lawyers then you want them as far away from that sort of trouble as possible.\n\nIt's a class thing. People who don't need violence should recognise that that's a privilege that not everyone can afford.\ntwoVices: This cmv is about parents hitting their kids. Not about how people are treated in their neighborhoods.\n\nEven if it was, can you explain to me how parents using physical violence to discipline their children would be helpful to keep kids from being \"punch bags or fuck toys\"?\nbinlargin: Children should respect their parents as role models and protectors, they emulate their behaviour. If you grow up in an area where violence is king and your parents are nonviolent then you are either nonviolent yourself and get trodden on, or you learn respect for and command of violence elsewhere and obtain role models with vastly different views to your parents.\n\nIn that sort of culture the threat of and willingness to use violence when wronged is a valuable tool, children emulating parental violence is training in this tool. To shy from violence in such an environment is to be weak and exploited.\n\nSo what I'm getting at is it's important to not assume that everyone is middle class and living in nonviolent society, and make blanket assumptions about what is right or wrong based on that. People need to play the cards they've been dealt, not someone else's.\ntwoVices: I don't think that you have any idea what you're talking about. How you treat family and how you treat outsiders are completely different discussions. \n\nThis is reader meet author all over the place.  \"Violence is king\"? \"Leafy suburbs\"? I'm willing to bet that you don't have any experience with the populations you're romanticizing. Are you from Decatur?\ncornelius2008: I won't say the above commenter is right but, they bring up some interesting ideals.  Base on my somewhat small personal circles the folks who would be easily bullied where I grew up are the folks who grew up without getting hit as children and those that wouldn't be bullied are those who were.   It may not be a correlation and definitely isn't scientific but, I think the idea deserves some investigation. \ntwoVices: And I can think of a couple people who were bullied by parents who went on to be doormats by others. It's anecdotal.\nbinlargin: Bullying isn't the same, it's not what I'm taking about at all. You can bully someone without touching them and turn them into a doormat.\ntwoVices: What *are* you talking about? You assert that hitting your kids is class based. How is that?  You talk about the \"mean streets\" like someone who's never taken the bus.  You're mixing this all up into some romanticized the wire scenario that you've never experienced.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm simply trying to advocate for children when even their \"trusted\" adults think it's OK to hit them. It's not. That's all I'm saying.\nbinlargin: You really need an appeal to authority to settle your ad hominems? I'm British, ex-council and generalising. I live down the same street as my parents, I'm in my late 30s and still drink with lads I went to school with. I never went to college or university. My friends at home consist of skilled manual workers, minimum wage, the unemployed and some criminal underclass. My roots are working class poor.\n\nI work away from home as a software consultant, brought in to fix problems that can't be fixed in house so I interact a lot with upper management who are disproportionately toffs. I have friends in most of the large cities in the UK, they're mostly very fucking middle class.\n\nTwo days ago I helped break up a fight between one guy and another who'd sold coke to and stole money from his 14 year old sister, yesterday I had lunch with an antenatal group, four of the eight being doctors.\nSo I think I'm quite well placed to make non-judgemental observations on attitudes across class boundaries, at least in British society. \ntwoVices: You're not Mike Skinner, mate. And if you were it wouldn't matter. You're waxing romantic and it's not important to the point:\n\nHitting kids is not OK, and it's not necessary. \n\nSince you assert that I have made some logical fallacies, the onus lies on you to explain yourself, to argue your point. Please do so.\nbinlargin: I've stated my position on why it could be useful, you attacked me as a person.\n\nYou're guilty of the same shit you accuse me of, but in your case you're romanticising a perfect family relationship where the parents exist outside of power struggles and teach how to navigate a world of law abiding pacifists.\n\nI'm sorry if your parents were violent bullies and this has tainted your view of the world, but that's not everyone's experience. There's merit in refraining from violence where possible and not bullying people, but to rule out all violence and threats of it in all situations because some people have it bad, that's just foolish.\ntwoVices: I think you're trying to explain your ad hom assertion, right?  I never said you were wrong because of any personal attack.\n\nAgain, this cmv is about corporal punishment. You keep bringing up class and other interpersonal relationships that have nothing to do with the actual topic. I keep trying to bring the conversation back to the topic and you keep trying to be Britain's foremost street poet.\n\ntl;dr- I didn't say you're wrong because you're clueless. I said you're wrong **and** you're clueless.\n\nSo, when/how did I make an appeal to authority?\nbinlargin: I suggested that you were seeking an authority to appeal to.\n\nAnyway, I don't see how this conversation can bear the sort of fruit we come to this subreddit for. I find your view as blinkered as you find mine offensive, and it's just an argument at this point. So unless you can try to engage me in a way that both understands and tries to change my view we're wasting our time here. \n\nHave a lovely Christmas off.\n", "prompt": "[deleted]: CMV: I don't think physical punishment (whipping/spanking, slapping hands, pulling ears) is ever the proper way to deal with misbehaving children.\n[deleted]\ntwoVices: I'm late to the party on this one, but I feel very strongly about this.", "orig": "tl;dr: hitting kids is not necessary.

{"full_text": "spyridon_: What do you do when all suggestions fail?\nEarlier today I was standing in a secluded outside area behind this bar where the society meetings are held at my college, resting my head against the wall and feeling utterly dead inside. I cant even count how many times ive gone to a society meetup or event with the intention of being social and meeting new people and failed. Id just spent around an hour sitting at the edge of the group trying to think of things to say, and whenever I did talk the reaction would be muted, polite laughter or people giving eachother those \"oh my god why the fuck is he even here\" looks\n\nGenuinely I just wanted to smash my face against the wall and die, I visualised it and tried to determine whether I could die from the impact. When im in groups its like I have a shirt with a quote from mein kampf on it something, people turn away from me and ive become good enough at reading body language that its like every second I exist near other people feels like another huge misstep, my presence is simply wrong. \n\nBut im doing it all, I hold eyes with the few people who can be bothered to look at my asymmetrical and repellent fucking fish face, I smile, the reading I get back isnt interest or desire to know me better, its just a sort of puzzlement, maybe some of them are amused at my audacity to even think I could socialise on their level. I dont know\n\nCan I give up? Am I entitled to give up and just not have to fucking do this anymore?\nSuperhippie1000: You're definitely making up problems in your head. Nobody feels that way about you but yourself. Also you mentioned you sit there trying to think of something to say. That's counterproductive. You don't wanna be up in your head when you're trying to socialize you wanna be present and in the moment. \n\nFailure is a natural part of the process. If you haven't succeeded yet then you haven't failed enough times. Keep trying and keep learning and you'll get there eventually.\nspyridon_: Ive been doing this several times a month for around 3 years now\nSuperhippie1000: Doing what? Not actually putting in any effort and instead creepily staring at people and expecting them to just be your friend? Trying the same failed but comdortable method over and over isn't really trying. You have to try new things proactively.\n\nBefore you even do that you need to get your life on track. Get your diet right and exercise. You also need to be doing proactive things with your life such as work, education and hobies. I also highly highly recommend meditation and yoga.\n\nThen when it's time to socialize you need to bring value. Don't go out to meet people and try to suck value and friendship out of them for your own sake. Rather go out and say to yourself \"how can I make these people feel good? How can I make them smile? How can I improve their day?\" If you do this rather than getting all up in your head and thinking about whether they like you or not, you'll have friends in no time.\nspyridon_: I started doing cardio 2 years ago on a recommendation by my therapist, id say my diet is fine, I dont eat fast food or anything\n\nI dont think I do just sit there, I do make an effort to say things, I try to say things relevant to the conversation and largely get ignored or stared at, most of them dont seem to be conversational geniuses but they get by\n\n\n", "prompt": "spyridon_: What do you do when all suggestions fail?\nEarlier today I was standing in a secluded outside area behind this bar where the society meetings are held at my college, resting my head against the wall and feeling utterly dead inside.

Do you have any examples of what she is doing wrong and why?\nHermemes: It's not unfair, it's exactly what she's doing here. Let me quote from a transcript that I've found. \n\n&gt; Before you come to ethics, you must answer the questions posed by metaphysics and epistemology: Is man a rational being, able to deal with reality \u2014 or is he a helplessly blind misfit, a chip buffeted by the universal flux? Are achievement and enjoyment possible to man on earth \u2014 or is he doomed to failure and distaste? Depending on the answers, you can proceed to consider the questions posed by ethics: What is good or evil for man \u2014 and why? Should man's primary concern be a quest for joy \u2014 or an escape from suffering? Should man hold self-fulfillment \u2014 or self-destruction \u2014 as the goal of his life? Should man pursue his values \u2014 or should he place the interests of others above his own? Should man seek happiness \u2014 or self-sacrifice?\n\nThis series of polar questions all summarize the polar relationship between her image of the heroic man against her image of the villainous man. These aren't the basic questions of ethics and I consider it ethically wrong to present them as such. \n\nIn fact, the thesis of the speech seems to be that everyone needs philosophy solely for the opportunity to affirm Rand's conclusions. \naynrandfan: Those aren't the basic questions of ethics--she says so in the part you quoted! Reread it yourself. She says that certain philosophical issues and positions presuppose ethics. Are you saying that these questions are false or in fact not important to the study of ethics?\n\nYou are making baseless, loaded assumptions. She doesn't jump to a discussion of heroes and villains in this talk.\n\nYou are incorrect about the thesis. You should listen to the lecture or read it (there is a book and essay by the same name, and the essay is simply the transcript of the lecture) before commenting on the thesis.\n\nIn fact, you must have already found the article. Read it. You will find that you are in error or ignoring or forgetting what she is saying.\nHermemes: &gt; Those aren't the basic questions of ethics--she says so in the part you quoted! Reread it yourself. She says that certain philosophical issues and positions presuppose ethics.\n\nShe implies that they are in introducing those questions by saying, \"... you can proceed to consider the questions posed by ethics:\"\n\n&gt; You are making baseless, loaded assumptions. She doesn't jump to a discussion of heroes and villains in this talk.\n\nWith those dyadic questions, she obviously poses the possibility of two moral conclusions: one being good and the other being evil. She says nothing more of ethics. I don't want to continue this discussion if you are only going to play the irrational contrarian. \n\n&gt; You are incorrect about the thesis. You should listen to the lecture or read it (there is a book and essay by the same name, and the essay is simply the transcript of the lecture) before commenting on the thesis.\n\nI arrived at this conclusion after reading the transcript. The way she makes straw men of past philosophers, especially Kant, in the following quote proves as much.\n\n&gt;\"Don't be so sure \u2014 nobody can be certain of anything.\" You got that notion from David Hume (and many, many others), even though you might never have heard of him. Or: \"This may be good in theory, but it doesn't work in practice.\" You got that from Plato. Or: \"That was a rotten thing to do, but it's only human, nobody is perfect in this world.\" You got that from Augustine. Or: \"It may be true for you, but it's not true for me.\" You got it from William James. Or: \"I couldn't help it! Nobody can help anything he does.\" You got it from Hegel. Or: \"I can't prove it, but I feel that it's true.\" You got it from Kant. Or: \"It's logical, but logic has nothing to do with reality.\" You got it from Kant. Or: \"It's evil, because it's selfish.\" You got it from Kant.\n\n\n&gt; In fact, you must have already found the article. Read it. You will find that you are in error or ignoring or forgetting what she is saying.\n\nI am doing none of these things but, in your apologetics, I necessarily must because it is the first dogma of objectivism that Ayn Rand can never be in error. You've made no empirical point in any of your reply and only rely on this vacuous, contrary rhetoric. I'm sure you'll tell me that you haven't. In that case, I will be satisfied that I am correct in my assessment. \n\nIn other words, I doubt your defense is detached enough to make any substantial point and I'll simply let those third parties who read this exchange to decide for themselves. \naynrandfan: &gt;\"She implies that they are in introducing those questions by saying, .\"... &gt;you can proceed to consider the questions posed by ethics:\"\"\n\n&gt;With those dyadic questions, she obviously poses the possibility of &gt;two moral conclusions: one being good and the other being evil. She &gt;says nothing more of ethics. I don't want to continue this discussion &gt;if you are only going to play the irrational contrarian.\n\nShe correctly says that there are certain essential questions on which ethics rests, and when it comes to the field of ethics, there are certain major questions, which she states. This isn't all she has to say about ethics. Her main ethical essay is The Objectivist Ethics which is free for viewing here:http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ari_ayn_rand_the_objectivist_ethics\n\nIf you want her essential treatment of ethics, it is there. Other than that, for your position to hold water, you'd have to give an argument for why those aren't important ethics questions, or why those questions are flawed.\n\nMaybe in this talk that is all she says about ethics (which I am very sure is not the case, but I will take it for granted for now), but you have to see the thesis of the entire lecture--that man needs philosophy in order to live. She isn't trying to prove her ethical theories here.\n\nAnd yes, with those questions, there is a right/good answer and a wrong/evil answer. What is the problem with that?\n\nI am not being an \"irrational contrarian\"--you are implying that Ayn Rand is wrong when she is in fact not. And you are mischaracterizing her. I am pointing to facts, i.e. empirical knowledge, that you are in the wrong. If you keep the context, you were the one who made the original comment, and I am defending an unjust mischaracterization of her. You are the one who started the \"contrary rhetoric\" and I am showing that you are not proving your case.\n\n&gt;\"the first dogma of objectivism that Ayn Rand can never be in error\"\nDo you have any proof for this insulting claim?\n\nSpeaking of how one should make empirical points to make one's case, how is it that Rand is making straw men of the philosophers you quoted?\n\nAre you implying that you are \"detached\" enough from your dislike of Ayn Rand to make \"any substantial point\"?\n\nSure, I welcome third parties to view this. I think that if one is going to criticize someone, one should address what they actually say, and prove that he or she is wrong using some sort of argument. You have failed to do this. Until someone does this, I won't be responding. And I will not respond to insults either.\n\nHermemes: You've written this:\n\n&gt;Those aren't the basic questions of ethics--she says so in the part you quoted!\n\nThen you've written this:\n\n&gt; She correctly says that there are certain essential questions on which ethics rests, and when it comes to the field of ethics, there are certain major questions, which she states.\n\nWhich is it? Either these are fundamental questions of ethics or they are not. They cannot be both. \n\n&gt; Maybe in this talk that is all she says about ethics\n\nMy response is obviously addressing this speech and not Rand's moral philosophy in general. \n\n&gt; And yes, with those questions, there is a right/good answer and a wrong/evil answer. What is the problem with that?\n\nThey present a [false dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma) that ignores the complexity of ethics in order to re-envision it as a struggle between Ayn Rand and everyone else. \n\n&gt; Speaking of how one should make empirical points to make one's case, how is it that Rand is making straw men of the philosophers you quoted?\n\nShe's making straw men by literally putting words in their mouths that represent Rand's own conclusions on their philosophies with no charity to the substance of their work. Hume's critique of induction or William James' pragmatism are not reducible to those non-quotes.  \n\n&gt; I am not being an \"irrational contrarian\"--you are implying that Ayn Rand is wrong when she is in fact not. And you are mischaracterizing her. I am pointing to facts, i.e. empirical knowledge, that you are in the wrong. If you keep the context, you were the one who made the original comment, and I am defending an unjust mischaracterization of her. You are the one who started the \"contrary rhetoric\" and I am showing that you are not proving your case.\n\nYes, you are. I've made an accurate observation of Rand's bias in her section on ethics and, through extension, the whole of the speech. At best, you've waffled on the point of importance of her questions to the subject of ethics and admitted that she characterizes ethics as a binary opposition. Otherwise, you've only stated the contrary and accused me of ignorance, i.e. you're made no facts.\n\n\n&gt; And I will not respond to insults either.\n\nThere have not been any insults in my reply, unless you mean to suggest that the very act of criticizing Ayn Rand is an insult to you which I can only guess is what you are referring to given the general character of your replies. \n", "prompt": "aynrandfan: Why Everyone Needs Philosophy.\n\nHermemes: Of course, when it comes to ethics, Ayn Rand divides it in a series of either/or questions that essentially rhetorically make the same point: are you an objectivist or are you a suicidal idiot?\naynrandfan: That", "orig": "'s very unfair to her.

Maybe ballbearing sliding drawer hardware so that the mouse tray could slide out rather than swing out?\n\nAlternatively you could just get a tenkeyless keyboard and that might give you enough room for your mouse pad. I'm doing exactly that for my kids keyboard tray. They don't need super amazing keyboards so I got em some slim chicklet style usb keyboards (~12\" in width) since all I have room for is an 18.5\" keyboard tray\nJimmeeehhhh: &gt;ballbearing sliding drawer hardware \n\nI may have to look into that idea, seems it'd be much better.\n\nHow would I go about doing this?

Even she taking all medications prescribed by doctor; it doesn\u2019t seem to control or lower. Now she has problems with swelling. What are some ways to lower and what to ask doctor to improve her health conditions\nLogical-Wasabi7402: Tell her to ask her doctor for a referral to a dietician. They're specialists in helping with the diet part of things like this. \n\nNote: not a nutritionist. A dietician. Nutritionists aren't certified(at least in the states). Dieticians are.\nMagicJava: I don\u2019t trust much that that industry says. They told us to drink skim milk and that butter was bad for us and that most of what we eat should be processed carbs.\nLogical-Wasabi7402: You sure you were talking to a *certified* dietician and not a wannabe nutritionist that doesn't need any special schooling or tests or anything at all?\nMagicJava: They still preach low-fat options. I\u2019m sure the food pyramid and myPlate were made by a room of intelligent dietitians and we all know those aren\u2019t the healthiest way to eat\nLogical-Wasabi7402: I mean, I wouldn't trust something we show 6 year olds to be properly detailed either. \n\nOf course they preach low fat. Because Americans in particular already eat far too much. And swapping butter for margarine, and whole milk for skim, is a much smaller step than swapping daily burgers for daily salads. Eating too much fat = a higher risk of heart disease. Which is *the* leading cause of death in the US.\nMagicJava: I know there is a correlation between fat consumption and obesity prevalence. Though it\u2019s not the full story. According to this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987052/#!po=23.2673) most of Europe consumes more saturated fat as a percent of total caloric intake. I know it\u2019s from 2010 but it\u2019s the best data could find. Obviously, other than the UK, our obesity issue is worse. \n\nAnecdotally only, I think it\u2019s the type of foods that are unhealthy in other ways are also likely to be fat laden. I\u2019ll be honest, my daily fat as a percent of calories is high but I stay at maintenance. You can\u2019t tell me that skim milk with whole grain cereal is better than the 4 eggs I eat. If I ate the first option I would end up overeating later in the day.\nLogical-Wasabi7402: That's a lot of words about obesity when I specifically said heart disease.\nMagicJava: First, they\u2019re inextricably linked. Second, rates of heart disease in Western European countries are lower than that in the us and they consume more fat as a percent of daily calories. Happy?\nLogical-Wasabi7402: The average European is significantly more active than the average American.

But in broad terms, I believe the world is divided in regions of cultural homogeneity that compete with each other for world hegemony (economical, cultural and eventually political).\n\n\n[This is a map I could agree with, for example.](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/286/a/6/clash_of_civilizations_world_map_by_saint_tepes-d68d0kw.png)\n\n(*edit for clarity : I'm not familiar enough with Ethiopia and Haiti's situation here, so I would not know if they're rightfully taken apart. I mostly agree with Turkey &amp; Japan being hybrid even though it may complexify the map. I agree with Israel being a unique state.)\n\n\nI'm aware that \"homogenous\" here can sound simplistic. I know that all these regions carry internal divisions, and opposing agendas, but I believe their sum of the divergences is less important than the sum of the convergences. In the end it's still about the clash.\n\n\nChange my view.\nGrapeban: Huntington's theory doesn't explain why the greatest clashes seem to happen within civilisations. For example, we have here painted a \"Muslim\" civilisation, and yeah, they have shared cultural roots, but why are we seeing such large clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran? Saudi Arabia is willing to defy its cultural groupings and get American backing, and Iran is willing to do the same to get Russian/Chinese backing.\n\nIt's the same around the world. There are long-standing clashes present between Latin American nations. In Europe and Central Asia we see countries defying their cultural groupings, Ukraine is coming closer to the EU whilst certain Central Asian countries are pulling away from Russia to be closer to China (see the failure of Russia's \"Eurasian Union\")\n\nHuntington never claimed his theory was perfect, but he argued it did explain the most. I disagree, I think a realist explanation based around nation-states own interests trumping all explains most about how the world functions, and I do not think these civilisational bonds truly exist, or at least, they cease to exist as soon as they conflict with nation-state self-interest.\nGnosticGnome: I would actually expect the greatest clashes to occur within civilizations rather than between them.  After all, if two groups have only partially-overlapping goals, they have room for compromise that isn't zero-sum.  If two groups have the same goals, then any compromise is more likely to be zero-sum.\nGrapeban: Huntington's theory specifically said he expected the greatest clashes between civilisations, but even if we move away from Huntington, what you've said doesn't make much sense to me. Why do different civilisations necessarily have different goals? That isn't the definition of a civilisation.\nGnosticGnome: I agree that Huntington hasn't thought it totally through.\n\nBut compare the Iran-Iraq war to the US-Iraq war.  When Iran and Iraq fought, it was over which country should be the hegemonic power over the Middle East, whether Shia Islam or Sunni Islam should dominate religiously, and several other issues.  When Iraq and the US fought, hegemony was an issue - but the US didn't want to impose Shia on Iraq.  As a result, the Iran-Iraq war was much more brutal than the US-Iraq war.  Religious leaders in Iraq knew that the US would not really care about sectarian theology; even many of the bombers during the US occupation attacked rival Iraqi congregations rather than the US.  \n\nIn other words, the fact that the West doesn't care about dominant faiths whereas the Middle East does means that any conflict between the West and Middle East can involve compromises where the Western power refrains from turning mosques into churches.  Likewise, if two Western powers fight over territory, only one can get the territory.  A \"compromise\" has to look like \"I get this half and you get that half\".  See the Berlin Wall. But China is different, because its view of time is not identical to the West.  China can make deals like it did in Hong Kong, where Britain got the territory for a century and then had to turn it over to China.  That kind of deal wouldn't be easy for two Western powers or two Asian powers.\nGrapeban: First, and this isn't a necessarily bad thing, but this idea is a completely different one to Huntington's I think. His central point isn't that civilisations exist, and that's really the only point you and him agree on, his point is that he thinks civilisations will, generally, fight and groups within civilisations will get along.\n\nAnd I think there are many examples that contradict your point, and that the relative tameness of the Iraq-US war is mainly just to do with how the US operates and the nature of the war.\n\nThere's was plenty of brutality in, say, Vietnam, or in the Soviet war in Afghanistan, or the Japanese invasion of China (and most sources I've seen agree that Japan is not in the same civilisation as China). And I'm not sure how you can claim that the Soviet Union and the US were both Western, so I don't see what the Berlin Wall example proves.\nGnosticGnome: \u2206\n\nThe commonality of goals doesn't actually relate to civilizations as much as I'd thought.  Vietnam may have been sparked by Vietnamese vs Vietnamese conflicts and Russia vs US conflicts, but as you point out, Russia and the US really shouldn't be in the same civilization anyway.  And if I'm really putting them together because they're playing the same game rather than because of commonality of culture, then culture/civilization becomes pretty tangential to my argument.  So I don't know that looking at civilizations in a broad sense makes that much sense after all, so much as noting particular commonalities/differences in particular conflicts would.\nDeltaBot: Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/Grapeban. ^[[History](/r/changemyview/wiki/Grapeban)]\n\n^[[Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltabot)][[Code](https://github.com/alexames/DeltaBot)][[Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaBot/)]\n", "prompt": "AE-lith: I believe the clash of civilizations is real and happening.

He is not committed because he believes it cannot be known whether p or ~p. If he did believe it could be known whether p or ~p, then he would believe p or ~p. Believing both or neither is a contradiction.

It is weird that you have to go to those extremes to try to disprove my point.\n\nSynonymous words are different words, but within a specific context they convey the same meaning.\n\nFor example, in the context of what an agnostic believes, he is a disbeliever. In the context on why an agnostic disbelieves, it is because of empiricism. In the context of muslim perspective, he is an infidel, etc.. etc...\n\n&gt; As the definition of synonym states, it is a word with the same or a similar meaning.

But it is interesting how you can read all of this, and in the back of your skull, think that an agnostic is **NOT** same nor similar to the word *disbeliever*.

If you care to reread what I wrote and let it sink in, then you'll understand everything you just wrote is quite silly.\nOxiris: Right. Because in your world, the word synonym exists, but it doesn't mean anything, and they have nothing to do with the words they are synonymous to... for example agnostic and disbeliever. Gotcha!\nNeoPlatonist: i never said that.\nOxiris: Then tell, instead of avoiding of giving a direct answer. **Why is disbeliever a synonym for agnostic?**\n\nTo answer that question correctly, you'd have to consider some of the problems in your logic:\n\n- 1) You don't understand the difference between **\"believe in not A\"** versus **\"not believe in A\"**\n\n- 2) disbelieve does not mean **belief of the contrary position\". (reason why you have trouble understanding #1)\n\nIf a group of scientists review a well written hypothesis, but there is no evidence yet to back such hypothesis, the scientific board will have to withhold belief. They at the current moment would not be believing in the theory. This is what it means to disbelieve. This in no way means that they believe that the hypothesis is false. But I guess it is no use, you weren't able to grasp it then, you are not now.\nNeoPlatonist: Listen, you've already won the award for worst argument in the world. I have no idea what your obsession with synonyms is about. You've even misrepresented my position on them when I was quite clear. I can't even fathom what your sticking point on them is. Why is disbelieve a synonym for agnostic? Because Roget fucking wrote it in his fucking book? As I have said, an agnostic does not believe we can know whether there is or is not a God - in that sense, he is a 'disbeliever'. He is also a  'disbeliever' if we word it \"an agnostic believes we cannot know whether there is or is not a God\" because in neither case does he believe in God, whether he 'believes we cannot know' or 'does not believe we can know - in both cases he still does not believe in God, which is why when a theist looks at an agnostic he calls him a disbeliever.\n\nIt seems your whole trivial argument boils down your belief that 'to believe' is to actively do something (what? I don't know, have neurons in a certain configuration? take one side of an argument and not the other?) while 'to not believe' is to not really do anything (even though yes your neurons are in some other certain configuration and yes you take the other side of an argument) and hey I can't be criticized for not believing p but I could be criticized for believing ~p why because I say so and thesaurus and faq and dictionary and mumblejumble evidence. It is just **fucking stupid**, bro. Just a tsunami of stupidity.\n\n&gt;1) You don't understand the difference between \"believe in not A\" versus \"not believe in A\"\n\nThere is no difference. Explain to me what a 'belief' actually is? Explain to me what it means \"to believe\" something. To take one side in an argument and not another? Do you even Moore's paradox?\n\nDisbelief certainly does mean belief of the contrary position when not believing the contrary entails a contradiction. You might not *say* you believe it, and you might construct ridiculous belief taxonomies to defend your irrational position, but this is simply delusion. If you go outside in the rain and say \"I don't believe it is not raining.\" well *of course* you believe it *is* raining. If you then add, \"I also don't believe that it is raining\" then you are clearly delusional. \n\n&gt;This in no way means that they believe that the hypothesis is false.\n\nOf course it does. They believe the hypothesis is false until it is proven. All hypothesis are considered false until they are proven. And even if it is proven they still hold that it could be proven false again by future evidence. None of this prevents people from trying to prove the hypothesis. You can believe something is false and still try to prove it.\n\nOh yeah and here you go:\n\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agnostic?s=t\n\nSynonym Study\nAgnostic, atheist, infidel, skeptic  refer to persons not inclined toward religious belief or a particular form of religious belief. An agnostic  is one who believes it impossible to know anything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine.

It's flat, the roads are neatly designed in a grid and very wide, all the buildings adhere to the same dull color scheme, a large cookie-cutter design. Use street view to click on any intersection, they all look identical. The entire city feels like it's just grayscale. Some people might read this and think it sounds great, and I've always had trouble putting my finger on what exactly is missing, but there's just no soul there.\nbig_bad_brownie: This post kind of sent me down a rabbit hole of my memories and experiences, and I\u2019m honestly asking myself if Irvine was really that bad or if I was just a bratty 20-something.\n\nIrvine is suffocating because it\u2019s a cage. The sole purpose of the city is to serve as one giant plot of real-estate: residential and commercial. The thought of graduating from the college, working in one of the many office buildings in the area, and eventually buying a condo\u2026 In a superficial sense, it\u2019s very much the American dream. But Irvine is a city explicitly designed to afford this and only this. \n\nWork. Pay off your mortgage. Travel at the speed limit. Come to a full stop at stop signs. Occasionally dine at the Cheesecake Factory. Walk around the city\u2019s shiny outdoor shopping mall on the weekend. Maybe visit a park and watch the geese. Kiss your wife on the cheek. Go to bed. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe whole city is like a controlled experiment: one big exercise in compliance.\n\nI dunno man. I\u2019m in my thirties and not getting any younger. But that still sounds marginally more appetizing than the barrel of a shotgun.\n\nNo thanks.\n_HOG_: You like people speeding and rolling stop signs? And a cage - WTF?\n\nThe planning and infrastructure in Irvine is something every other city in California should aspire to.\n\nA SHOTGUN\u2026OK buddy\u2026talk to a therapist lately?\nmountainsurfdrugs: It's a city designed for cars, not humans. No one should aspire to plan a city like that, it is a soulless corporate hellhole full of neoliberal NIMBY HOA petit bourgeois fucks. Anyone who who thinks it is good should be banished to the woods. Irvine is literally the worst. They are correct about banning adds though.\n_HOG_: Find another California city with as many trees and planned walking paths. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong - not enough junkies in the parks for you or did you get shipped out when you were one?\n\n&gt; soulless corporate hellhole full of neoliberal NIMBY HOA petit bourgeois fucks\n\nYou don\u2019t sound bitter at all.\nmountainsurfdrugs: Pretty much any town in norcal has more trees and actual trails, with the added benefit of not looking like a buisness park. Santa Cruz/Aptos, tahquitz, most of the eastern sierras, eureka, etc. I'm assuming you don't count actual nature or hiking trails though, it has to be concrete/woodchip paths connecting identical looking neighborhoods to identical looking shopping centers, with trees sourounded in concrete, to count, right? \n\nAlso, really cool of you to bring my past drug addiction into this. I wasnt a homeless addict though, buying bitcoin in 2010 and  then a huge amout of gme calls november 2020 turned out to be pretty good choices to make while high on heroin.  I've been clean for the last year and a half now,  i did heroin daily before but no one except my now wife knew. Primarily since i had a life and could afford it.  All those junkies you hate living in the park  would be living a normal life too if they didn't have to spend most of their day struggling to not be sick. Would be great to see some free heroin maintenance clinics in irvine modeled after the ones in Switzerland. It would save a lot of people especially with fetanyl in street drugs now. Im sure you're smug now but just wait till your kid dies from doing some ecstasy cut with fent at a party. Probably better than growing up during the coming climate apocalypse at least. Looking at your post history I can see you're a neolib asshole, I would normally make some kind of joke about that but hearing your noble defense of the great city of Irvine is way funnier than anything I could think of.

I\u2019m sure you are liberal about drug policy for sensible reasons, but allowing people the freedom to own production and IP, hire labor, and discover new markets is bad? I\u2019m really curious to understand what utopia you\u2019re dreaming up where we all have to live off the gov\u2019ts teat, but hey - plenty of access to drugs? Are you sure you have the necessary concrete economic and societal ideologies to be going around slighting people as \u201cneoliberal?\u201d\n\n&gt; Im sure you're smug now but just wait till your kid dies from doing some ecstasy cut with fent at a party.

Now you\u2019re seemingly hoping my child becomes a victim of opiates as well to suit your spiteful disposition?\n\n&gt; Looking at your post history I can see you're a neolib asshole, I would normally make some kind of joke about that but hearing your noble defense of the great city of Irvine is way funnier than anything I could think of.\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty clear that your use of \u201cneoliberal\u201d as an insult has little to do with your understanding of neoliberalism and more to do with your own insecurities and unresolved anger which you\u2019re eager to take out on anyone and everything at every opportunity.\n\nIn a sensible conversation, I think most people would find Irvine has a lot of respectable qualities that can be admired by most people looking for a safe city with easy access to education, economic opportunity, and infrastructure/services. I\u2019m not mounting a defense for Irvine having the character or culture everyone desires in a city, everyone has their preference - like the lack of billboards and advertising. You decided to take the conversation beyond sensible, and tried to insult people, and for that you get my criticism - if you cannot handle that then you know what to do next time I hope.\n\n&gt; I hope you have a nice time with your wife dancing at the gala.\n\nI did.

I hope for your family's sake you are more pleasant to be around irl. Sorry to hear about your friend, and I didn't wish your kid would OD, that is crazy. I'm not particularly angry or spiteful, my life is by in large pretty comfortable, I'm just not souless enough to support a system where the hardest workers make starvation wages while the wealthy, myself included, make more of off passive income in a year than the majority make in a lifetime. you seem to be projecting a whole lot onto me that is not very correct, maybe go spend some time outside in nature or something, it always helps me remember what really matters and feel more grounded.

Weird I know. We are in the process of buying around 1000 acres of forest land typically sold to logging companies in order to not cut down the trees and create a mostly self sustaining commune/militia/homestead community with other idealogically compatible  and capable friends/family.

In the mean time, have you thought about selling shares in your future potential earnings/assets? It's the way of the future and I need another joke security to short.

I think they were trying to make the point that alot of the time diy shows do things that remove character from the homes in favor of mass appeal.

I swear they all look the same. My mom keeps telling me to paint the red brick around my fireplace white. I feel like I'd regret doing that in a few years.\nPixarooo: I just bought a house built in the 70s, and the previous homeowners completely redid the kitchen about 5 years ago. The kitchen is what sold me on the house - deep, cherrywood cabinets, with tan and grey countertop/backsplash and brand new charcoal stainless appliances. And, thankfully, they never touched the red brick wood burning fireplace in the living room. I don't know if I would have wanted the house as much if the kitchen was that standard white on white on white shit that's so popular now. It looks so sterile to me. I can't stand it. And I truly believe that people who paint their brick or stone fireplaces white today are the same people who in the 80s and 90s put carpet on top of their hardwood floors.\nStrangerFeelings: House design now sucks.  I'd rather buy an 80 year old house, then one of the newer ones that'll start falling apart now.  And for \"open\" designs?  Maybe for the kitchen/dining room sure, but not everything else.\n\nI absolutly love coloring in the house too.  Blue/grey walls for the living room, colored backsplashes made from tile for the kitchen.  \n\nIts all so white and bland now.

Many old houses would actually save money with the cost of new insulation, windows, furnace, water heater etc. My buddies old house was old as hell and he needed to redo his wiring as it was original 100+ year old wiring, he kept tripping the fuses and there was one socket per room maximum, he ended up updating that as well. My moms house put in new windows and a much more efficient furnace, went from $500+ per month heating cost in winter to sub $200. They are great, but there is also generally a ton of issues that can crop up quick and cost in the thousands or tens of thousands.\nughhhtimeyeah: If you own a house that's old in Scotland, good luck updating it.\n\nMy parents house is about 200 years old, listed building.

More importantly, I can't imagine any reputable religious or social organization would censure the kidnapped individual's actions.\n\n3) if I were a slave, I would want to kill my owner\n\n4) as an empathetic person in the context of the 3 items above, I would be morally justified in taking violent action against a slave owner in an attempt to free a slave\n\n5) as proof of the moral correctness of this type of action, see the celebration of the lives of figures such as John Brown, Spartacus, Toussaint L'Ouverture, etc, who lead revolts that killed or aimed to kill slave owners in order to free slaves. See also the US civil war, although I suppose slave owners weren't specifically targeted for death in this case, just the armies they mustered to their cause.\n\n6) this is an uncontroversial trope in popular culture, see Django Unchained, the Chris Rock sketch where he goes back in time and shoots a slaveowners, etc.\n\n7) since 1 - 5 establish that it is morally correct to kill a slave owner in an effort to free a slave, and since 6 establishes that this is an accepted trope in US pop culture, Reddit should not threaten to ban chapotraphouse because its users keep saying that slave owners should die.\n\nCMV\nLittlepush: Read reddits rules https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy\n\nIt's right there. This is clearly inciting violence.\npyotr_the_great: I'd be hesitant to say that it's inciting violence, but saying that someone should die probably falls under calling for and encouraging violence. How are they going to die? Of natural causes?\n\n&gt;\"Do not post content that **encourages**, glorifies, incites, or **calls** for  **violence** or physical harm against an individual or a group of people\"\nGnosticGnome: I mean sure, but we don't follow that do we?

I'm not quite following you because convicted rapists are *typically* imprisoned against their will anyhow.\n\nAdditionally, admins can not watch everything so sometimes things slide. To ensure adherence to content policy, we have mods to make sure that the subreddit complies with Reddit's content policy. Even then, they can't check everything.\nGnosticGnome: &gt;Are you saying that imprisonment is equivalent to violence or physical harm? \n\nObviously, yes.  Literally men with guns will force one into a place one doesn't want to go by violent force.  That's clearly violence, and is backed by physical harm.\n\n&gt; I'm not quite following you because convicted rapists are typically imprisoned against their will anyhow.\n\nYes.  And I am permitted to advocate this continue to occur, and to glorify it.  Reddit will not complain one bit if I put a post on the very front page celebrating the police's capture and forcible imprisonment of a rapist.  Add in execution if desired - Reddit won't mind.\nJabbam: Are you arguing that prison is violence?\n\nBecause a common thread on cth is that prison is modern day slavery. That would reframe \"kill slaveowners\" as \"murder cops\" or \"pigs in a blanket fry em like bacon.\"\n\nCth has a history of using codewords. Last year there were several threads advocating softball and using language to imply they wanted more congressional shootings to happen.\nBlackHumor: Prison is obviously violence. It's not something that needs to be argued for, it's just a fact about the world. The process of putting someone in prison involves significant amounts of violence and of the threat of violence.\n\nNow, this doesn't necessarily mean that it's wrong, but it's important to point out that the thing most people say they support (\"political violence is always wrong\") is in fact supported by nobody except Gandhi. What most people mean by this is either \"unsanctioned political violence is always wrong\" or \"political violence should be minimized\".\ntweez: Bit of a tangent, but Gandhi said non-violent resistance was his tactic against the British specifically as he believed they had a collective need to appear morally superior. He said it wouldn't have worked against anyone else, so I'm not sure even he would have advocated for the idea that political violence was always wrong\nBlackHumor: Gandhi was in fact a pacifist generally, to the point where he thought that violent resistance to the Holocaust was wrong.\ntweez: I thought I remembered something about him saying that the non-violent resistance would only work with the British because they would have to be perceived as being of a higher moral standing. I am a forgetful moron though sometimes so I could be totally wrong too. Despite having internet access available, I'm reluctant to search this for myself and confirm I'm a forgetful moron.\n\nWasn't there something about Gandhi forbidding his wife to have some media treatment, but he then later had the same treatment himself? I'm sure there was a thing recently where the media pulled up some quotes from him where he was negative about black people. MLK seems like one of the few decent\nBlackHumor: He might have said that, I don't know. I do know that he very consistently was a pacifist though, so I think you're misinterpreting it if he did.\n\nMost of the stories about Gandhi are less bad if you look into them in detail. For example: Gandhi was a racist as a young man who believed in the British Empire, but once he started his activism he wasn't anymore.\n\nHe also fought with his son about an experimental treatment that he thought would merely prolong his wife's suffering while she was very near death.

{"full_text": "p00trulz: Full house reno complete!\n[https://imgur.com/a/F2F2wcY](https://imgur.com/a/F2F2wcY)\n\nWe bought this house last June and after 10 months we are done!  The house had been a rental for most of its life and was aesthetically extremely rough.  \n\nFirst thing we did was cover up all the beige paint with Elemental from Home Depot prior to tearing out the old floors.  This way we didn't have to worry about paint drops or spills.  \n\nStarting with the kitchen, we cut out the drywall that the old tile backsplash was on, hung new drywall and installed a mosaic tile backsplash using Mussel Bound adhesive mat.  While we had the old backsplash and drywall out, I flipped the switch for the pantry light from outside the pantry to inside the pantry.  Since the door hinges on the side that the lightswitch was on, if you opened the door before turning on the light, you had to close the door again to reach the switch.  Not well thought out.  My wife painted the cabinets and I installed a new dishwasher.  We contracted the Quartz countertops and extended the overhang for the bar by about 6 inches and had the counterop guys install a single-basin undermount sink.  I put in the faucet and a new garbage disposal and reran the plumbing to go from double-basin to single. easy enough to do but working with PVC solvent under the cabinet gave me a headache.  We replaced all the hinges and drawer sliders with soft close ones.  Shortly after, the bottoms of some of the drawers started falling out.  Turns out, the old sliders mounted on the bottom also supported the drawer bottoms.  When we changed the sliders to the new side-mounted ones the little staples couldn't hold on.  I glued them back on and secured them with small screws and they've been great since.\n\nI ripped up all the nasty old carpet that had been there since the house was built in the early 2000s.  Upstairs, I installed Pergo Outlast Plus laminate after pulling out all the staples, screwing down the subfloor to fix squeaks, and pulling off the baseboards.  Since we were living in the house, I did one room at a time and saved the hallway between them for last.  This meant I had to put in T-molds at all of the door ways.  If I were doing it again I would start in one corner of one room and do the entire thing as one unit to eliminate the transitions, but I guess this way there is more room for expansion.  I got a cordless oscillating multi tool to cut around the door casings where I needed to and to make the small cuts around closet shelves, doorways, and HVAC registers.  \n\nIn the walk-out basement, I installed Shaw LVP due to past water intrusion.  I traced the source of the water to a poorly routed sump discharge and gutter downspout that drained right next to the foundation and uphill from the basement door. Water was pooling by the door and coming in during heavy rainfall. To fix that problem I ran 40 feet of drain pipe from the downspout out into the yard in a hand dug trench and tied the sump discharge into it. I also cut out the basement door threshhold and replaced it.  Problem solved.\u00a0\n\nI replaced all of the ceiling fans except for the living room, and all all of the light fixtures. Again, straight forward other than one upstairs hall light where I had to put in a new box to lower it about 1/2 an inch so the light base would sit flush against the ceiling.\u00a0\n\nThe guest bathroom and laundry room upstairs got LVT floors. The guest bathroom had some rotten subfloor that I cut out and replaced and a new toilet flange. I also replaced the vanity and added a sliding shower door. Previously there had just been a curtain which is why the subfloor was rotten.\u00a0 One thing to watch out for with vanities that I learned is to check where the existing plumbing comes out of the wall. On mine it was too low for the integrated shelf in the new vanity so I had to notch it to make it fit.\u00a0\n\nThe final project was the master bath. I took out the old linoleum and vanity and put in marble LVT and a new 72\u201d granite top vanity. I measured the vanity at the base and marked it out on the floor so I could lay the tile perfectly up to the base.  Other than replacing leaky shutoffs this went without a hitch. I found it easier to cut the tile with the multi tool instead of a utility knife. I replaced the toilet and then ripped out the old shower insert while my wife painted the tub. For the new shower I went with a delta 3-piece system. With that in, straight forward according to the instructions, I replaced the drywall up to the new surround and used Trim Tec shower bead to get a crisp mud line before sealing with silicone. I hung new mirrors from Lowes, but didn't trust the single screw hanging point that came with it so I put a few healthy gobs of construction adhesive on the backs to keep them in place.  Due to time constraints I contracted the shower door.\u00a0 The access doors for the tub motor had busted hinges and we had trouble finding new ones that worked so I used a small bead of silicone to glue them to the surround.  If they need to come off in the future for maintenance, it shouldn't take more than a razor blade to free them.\nPatches_O_Houlihan69: I think they should have just ended the series instead of trying to translate the show to a new location.

I stretch M/W/F to the point where I can't stretch anymore and just hold myself up using the same muscles that are being stretched (Active static flexibility, I believe).\n\nThe twist is that this gets me EXTREMELY sore. Even till the next day. So my question is, should I stretch even if I'm very sore?\n\nIn addition to that, the difference between my splits when cold and when warmed up is HUGE. Like, when I'm cold it must be 90 degrees and when I'm warmed up it must be 150 degrees. How can I close this gap?\ngreen_banditos: Never stretch without warming up first. DO jump rope, jumping jacks, anything to get your body warm. You should stretch everyday, especially after working out to increase flexibility. Look up various stretches to always keep it different, google yoga, anything, but never stop being flexible \nErX29: When I tore my hamstring my Kinesiologist/PT and I talked alot about sports and such, and he told me that warming up by  active stretching is actually good. Starting easy without forcing yourself too much. Then doing dynamics and continuing the stretching. \n\nWhat's the reason to NOT warm up with active &amp; dynamic stretches?\nbrawnkowsky: You are right.  The person above probably thought you were referring to passive stretching (ex: touching your toes and holding for a few seconds).  Active stretching should proceed all workouts if you intend on keeping it safe.  Active stretching includes jumping jacks, lunges without weight, straight leg marches, skips, etc.  It should not be strenuous or difficult, but it should get your heart rate going, get blood flowing through your muscles, and increase body temperature.\n\nAnother good way to remove muscle soreness is through something called myofascial release.  It is essentially a massage of your muscles; you can do it by using a foam roll or a PVC Pipe and rolling it down your muscles.  What it does is separate the muscle fibers in your muscles back to their normal differences.  After a workout, the fascia (outer coating) of the fibers can mesh together, inhibiting sliding filaments, which helps cause soreness.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam_rolling\n\nAnd finally, you can do a lactic acid drain.  After a good lower body workout or run, lay on the grown with your legs straight.  Put your feet about 4-6 inches above the ground (ex. Pushing against the wall) and lay there for 5-ish minutes.  Drains the lactic acid from your muscles, feels real good.  \n\nIf you still feel very sore after all workouts and all of these techniques, lower the volume of your workout for a week or two (download).  Do the same workouts with the same intensity, but do half of the sets/reps.\n\nGood luck\nalexispres: I thought the lactic acid build up was disproven?\nbrawnkowsky: I haven't heard this, source?\nalexispres: \"Lactic Acid is commonly thought to induce muscle failure or soreness, but has not been shown to be the causative factor. It is highly correlated though[2], as lactic acid is produced when the muscle is sore; however its more of a fuel source than a soreness causing agent.[3][4][5]\"\n\nsource: http://examine.com/faq/why-do-my-muscles-get-sore.html\n\nI guess it's not necessarily disproved, my bad there. But according to examine.com there is no evidence it causes soreness. It still occurs though. :)\nbrawnkowsky: You're right, lactic acid doesn't cause soreness.

Like paying extra for a gluten free hair cut, or boneless chocolate bar. \n\nI had a friend forget her razor on vacation, I had forgotten mine as well and bought the generic 6 pack of them from a drug store.  I gave her one and mentioned it wasn't a big deal since it only cost a couple bucks for all of them.  She remarked how it worked better than the more expensive \"woman's\"(pink) razors she had been buying forever.  As far as I know she's been buying the less expensive generic \"men's\" razors ever since.\n\nIf some one want's to pay that much more for something because it's a different color or claims to before their gender it's on them. \nPreExistingAmbition: So, I'm guessing you didn't read the article because it's specifically mentions that women will pay more on their dry-cleaning. This is not a choice they can make in choosing a prettier product or a \"gluten free haircut\". Yes, women can choose not to buy pink razors but the problem goes beyond hygiene products. \nmischief88: I did in fact, and while I don't know the in's and outs of a dry cleaning business I would imagine a fancy blouse is going to cost the same as a basic shirt.  Has there been research into these \"sexist\" dry cleaners?  Can a woman drop it off and say it's a shirt and will she still be charged more?  If I as a man drop it off and even say it's a blouse, mine and not one belonging to a friend or spouse for that matter do I get a discount? \nPreExistingAmbition: The dry cleaning is an example of something that women cannot simply choose to buy cheaper. If women are charged more because their clothes is different fabrics, shapes, or complexity to clean then price adjustments are understood and should be communicated clearly to customers.\n\nBut this is not solely the issue. According to the research study, cited in the article, the following are examples of \"pink tax\" or \"idiot tax\" as you call it...\n\n7 percent more for toys and accessories\r\n4 percent more for children\u2019s clothing\r\n8 percent more for adult clothing \r\n13 percent more for personal care products\r\n8 percent more for senior/home health care products\n\nmischief88: I don't see why any of these items won't work or have a less fancy equivalent.  The only thing I could see have any source of traction is women's health vitamins, or feminine hygiene products.  I'm assuming a little girls dress is going to be fancier and cost slightly more than a boy's t-shirt with a foot ball printed on.  The same thing goes for the fancier fabric/cut blouses that they're choosing to buy.  Once again would any one even be able to notice if a woman were to use a men's shampoo, conditioner, or deodorant?  \n\nYou can complain and raise awareness all you want, but if you go out and spend 13% more on a product, even if you bitch about it online afterwards, the company made their money off you and will continue to do so until they don't make money.\n\n\"Hey, no ones buying these pink razors any more that we had to charge more for because we only sell 1/5th the amount and still have to shut down the line and change over the dye's and packaging for, thus decreasing our profit margin. Let's just make them all gray from now on and hope people can figure out they work the same on anybody's hair.\"\nPreExistingAmbition: I completely understand what you are saying. I'm all for buying the cheapest razor, regardless of color. When it comes to deodorant, scents can be pretty gender specific. Women typically don't want to smell like brut and men typically don't want to smell like sparkling roses. It gets harder to avoid buying things when scent is involved.\nClothes is another unavoidable expense. While a woman could wear a tailored 3 piece suit, which is a small fortune itself, some employers and schools require dresses and skirts. \nmischief88: I'll let you have that one because I've never done shopping for a dress or skirt (although the private school I went to gave girls the option to wear skirts, but also allowed them to wear slacks and a polo the same as the guys did).  I just find it hard to believe they're noticeably more expensive if not making an effort to dress impressive.  \n\nOn the same note as wearing a more expensive dress or blouse just to work to look nice I know girls who will do their make up every day just to go walk the dog or even sit around the house and do nothing (probably spending a small fortune on it), spending this extra money to feel pretty.  Besides the marketing done to convince them they need to, is no fault of the manufacture for what they spend on it. \n\nOnce again it's if I have to go buy the \"Big manly V8 muscle car to be a successful alpha male\"  instead of realizing my less flashy economy version of the same car will get me around just fine. \n", "prompt": "PreExistingAmbition: Burger King is doing their part to fight against the \"Pink Tax\"; putting pressure on lawmakers to pass legislation against charging women more than men for products and services.\n\nmischief88: I hate to call this an \"Idiot tax\" and offend women but that's what it seems to", "orig": "be in most cases.

{"full_text": "Firm_Distance_3065: What mental disorder does it sound like my best friend has?\nI\u2019ve had a friend for 12+ years and she\u2019s soon to be my cousin in-law because I\u2019m marrying her cousin. Anyway, she has some problems and it makes me wonder if she has a severe mental disorder that needs to be addressed by a license professional or if she\u2019s just straight up immature.. I will list some things she does. This is a 25 year old woman. \n\n- Very bad with money management. Time and time again she will get into a lease or rent a room and will have to move or get evicted because she\u2019s unable to keep up with the rent, whether it\u2019s $500 or $1,000. She falls behind. She\u2019s about to be evicted from her current apartment because she owes $3,000 since she\u2019s almost 3 months behind. Her cousin splits the rent with her so basically she hasn\u2019t been using the money to pay rent, at least for the half he\u2019s paid her. She happen to obtain this lease right before officially getting evicted from her previous apartment that she was only at for 2 months because she was having drama with her roommate. Now she\u2019s lasted only 5 months at this new lease. \n\n- She will buy iPhones from T-mobile, AT&amp;T and then end up selling them when she needs money for something such as rent (which as you\u2019ve read she also doesn\u2019t keep up with) even though she has a contract on the phone!! Then somehow will buy another iPhone once she gets the money only to repeat the same process over and over. Mind you she keeps the phones for only a couple months at a time if even before she has to sell it. \n\n- She\u2019s used her mom\u2019s social to obtain a co-signer for a lease behind her back. Also used her mom\u2019s business to get the iPhones which both cases her mom has had to report these cases as fraud so her credit report won\u2019t be affected. Because her mom actually has herself together, wants to buy another house soon, etc. \n\n- her mom bought her a car before but when times got tough (per usual) she got a title loan on the car, which ended up getting repo\u2019d because guess what, she didn\u2019t pay the loan. Then wants to blame it all on her mom for kicking her out of the house when they got into fights. She ends up hopping back and forth between her mom\u2019s house when she gets evicted from somewhere but then doesn\u2019t want to respect her mom and follow her rules so she blames everything on her mom when things go bad. So basically her mom lets her borrow one of her cars indefinitely. So she gets to keep it in her possession at all times but just doesn\u2019t have the title in her name so she doesn\u2019t go off and sell it. \n\n- Can\u2019t keep a job. Mainly will work fast food but something will happen and she starts no call no showing. \n\n- impulsive. Has left behind her apartment before to move cross country to California for a month. Then came back. \n\n- has interesting interests or behavioral problems. She\u2019s very intelligent but struggles to stick to a schedule, such as staying in school. She\u2019s had to drop every college course she\u2019s ever signed up for.  Even if it\u2019s only 2 classes at a time. Spends her money on anime stuff, wants to marry an Asian man as she has a fetish for Asians, wants to go live in Asia somewhere convinced that life will just be better. \n\n- will talk to lots of boys online, meet random people for hookups even if she has a boyfriend already. \n\n\nThis is a woman who doesn\u2019t drink alcohol or do drugs. This is just how she is. Does this come off like someone who\u2019s autistic or something and doesn\u2019t have their mental health under control or what??\nplushaddictanon: One thing I\u2019ve learned from being outside of the mental health \u201cindustry\u201d, from studying psychology, and from being a longtime patient with a slew of diagnoses, is that there are good and bad sides to diagnosing and treating people like they are flawed in some way. People don\u2019t respond well to the mentality behind psychology, which tries to objectify and treat problems through narrow scopes. Even so, there are great individuals and pockets of therapy. Most of those steer clear from trying to fit any individual into a diagnosis, and instead work with each person without labeling or implying negative assumptions. \n\nYour friend sounds like she\u2019s trapped in a cycle. She seems afraid to commit and control certain aspects of her life. That fear of control may show up in the impulsivity in both spending, and spontaneously traveling. I get it, where I live, life feels pretty glum, and there\u2019s an urge to escape and go find something better, rather than change myself to fit in. It seems too that her upbringing, especially with her mom, she may have been enabled a lot, instead of encouraged and shown how to take care of herself. She\u2019s used to being able to find a way to get her needs met without having to give into any system that tied her down. Some of her behaviors are definitely manipulative and she doesn\u2019t seem to have many people holding her accountable for how she\u2019s affecting others. As her friend, id try to approach her with a balanced statement. Life is f***in hard, and sometimes we get stuck in cycles that aren\u2019t healthy, she may feel trapped and/or think that she\u2019s dug herself too deep with debt, feels incapable or unimportant in the work environment, and therefore she digs herself further into escapism: trying to go somewhere else and start over. She sounds like someone who might appreciate you being upfront though and calling her out, as you have. Maybe sitting down and brainstorming what steps she\u2019s willing to take. Those may be finding a therapist that understands her and has a compatible approach (I\u2019ve been to\u2026 a lot of therapists. Learned from each one, and don\u2019t always trust the system, but as I said there are people who will jive with how you think, and let you lead the sessions). Or maybe it looks like finding other methods of self help, finding supportive groups who struggled with impulse control, reading books that match her ideology and beliefs. Diagnoses and meds can still be helpful, sometimes it\u2019s a matter of reframing them in a way that is helpful for her? \n\nEither way, I hope you\u2019re able to support her. The cycle she\u2019s in seems self defeating and from personal experience, hard to break out of. She may just need an extra shove to throw a wrench in it- help her see that she is always capable of breaking out.\nFirm_Distance_3065: Thank you very much!!\nplushaddictanon: You\u2019re welcome ^^ sorry I kinda ramble and cycle back on the topics, but I hope it\u2019s helpful!\nFirm_Distance_3065: Really was and I hope more people will answer like you. I just have a feeling that people are going to get offended and make this post go south and make it out into something it\u2019s not. I\u2019m just trying to seek other perspectives and clarity, not throw my friend under a bus.\nplushaddictanon: I get it, at first I thought it was gunna be a post like that, but I couldn\u2019t get over the fact that this is a friend you\u2019ve had for over 12 years, you don\u2019t back down from being straightforward about her faults, but people don\u2019t keep friendships if they feel like that person is irredeemable or just terrible, at least not a genuine friendship. I don\u2019t have the same exact issues as your friend, but I see how when I get stuck in my own cycles that I can definitely fall into doing similar things. She\u2019s got some growing to do, but hey we all do. And when I\u2019m in those cycles I\u2019m pretty miserable, I could imagine she might feel pretty stuck too. I hope more people give some helpful perspectives too!\nFirm_Distance_3065: I appreciate the honesty about your own personal experiences. We\u2019re all human and make dumb choices. I\u2019ve for sure made dumb financial choices with credit cards that I\u2019m now paying myself out of. I sure hope my friend improves her behavior.

You don't need to be able to read or speak the local language because most of the people living there have enough English to answer your questions and the signs and menus will be in English. The food you eat is often the same way -- yes, it started as a local recipe, but over time it was adapted to western tastes.

The short version is that the waitstaff serving American tourists has probably done more to adapt to the tourists than the tourists have to adapt to them.  They learned English, they learned about what you expect in a dining experience, they know how Americans like their food, they know what music American tourists expect in their shops.  \n\nThe real point of travel is to have fun and see something different.  \nHridaySabz: First off, adapted cuisine is nowhere near the authentic food you get to taste when you travel. You think the \"Indian\" food you get to taste in the States is anywhere near what you have in India? \n\nAlso, your reference to \"large modern cities\", the blog doesn't even talk about the fact that you need to learn a new language. It talks about how being in a foreign land, you get to experience things differently, as in the sights and sounds etc. Most real travellers (not the Instagram \"travelholics\") want to experience new things, and many backpackers opt to stay in smaller, less frequented places as a result.\n\nIt also makes reference to the fact that people travel to escape work. Don't think so? Ask a 9 to 5 working individual and offer them a two week no work vacation, see how quickly they take it.\n\n\"Load of bunk\" is ironically the same phrase that can be used to describe your 'fine criticisms' of this blog.\nPalentir: Yes it's locally made, I'm not disputing locally made.  I'm disputing that the recipe used isn't tweaked to American tastes.  If you eat local food in a rural village that doesn't get a lot of tourists, sure, it's probably authentic.  If you went to a local tourist spot in downtown Dehli, you might think it's authentic, but it's geared to tourists who come to India to see \"authentic \" Indian culture and eat authentic Indian food while ignoring that they are doing so in a place that makes millions of dollars in the tourism business and know how to cater to American adventure seekers.  Tourism is a major industry.  \n\nAnd as I said, most of the tourists I know who visit other countries are doing exactly that.  They go to Cancun or Puerta Vallarta, San Juan, or Tokyo or Seoul.  Places that every American visiting those countries goes to.  Many of them never leave the downtown area for more than a day.  So you essentially see the Disney version of those cultures where it's all made to look unique while being completely chewed on to not offend American sensibility or tastebuds.  If you want authentic, go to Rural Mexico where you'll be one of the only Americans there.  Go to rural Japan or Korea for that matter.  \n", "prompt": "HridaySabz: Traveling: What's the fascination?\n\nPalentir: What a load of bunk.\n\nMost people who travel go to large modern cities or tourist towns, places where \"local, exotic culture\" is quite often pre chewed by the large number of other tourists who have gone before you.", "orig": "You don't need to be able to read or speak the local language because most of the people living there have enough English to answer your questions and the signs and menus will be in English.

{"full_text": "Captain_Nachos: How to Handstand Pt 2 - Chest to Wall Handstands; Including Form Tips + How to Enter/Exit safely!\nHey guys, part 2 of this handstand tutorial series is out, this time its on chest to wall handstands.\n\n\n**LINK TO VIDEO HERE:** https://youtu.be/fOy7sE1_vI0\n\n\n\n**The Chest to Wall Handstand**\n\nChest to Wall Handstands are a super important progression and tool for your handstand training. They are the first progression (including their slightly scaled down cousin, the Wall Plank as shown in the video) of the handstand that actually involves being in a handstand, and of all the progressions for the handstand this one is the most important for helping you transfer that 'bodyline straightness' into an upside down, 'there's so much blood in my head and I can't breathe' style position.\n\nBecause of that, it's important to note that the Chest to Wall handstand is not just a progression that you can 'master' and them dump on the side of the road like an old shoe. Firstly, along with some 'back to wall' training and obviously, freestanding training, the chest to wall is going to be a tool in your handbalancing arsenal long after you achieve a freestanding handstand because of how it can help improve your bodyline, as it allows you to isolate away the balancing aspect and does not cause excessive lumbar arching like the back-to-wall.\n\nAs you can see in the video, my form is not yet perfect on the chest to wall handstand due to mobility limitations, yet I can hold a freestanding handstand to the best form that my mobility will allow for 45 seconds at best and 30 seconds on average. \n\nJust because I can handstand free of a wall doesn't mean I SHOULD ONLY do that. Chest to Wall handstands should be used in your training all the way up to the point you have a PERFECTLY straight freestanding handstand, and even then they should be used at the very least as a warm-up set before your freestanding practice.\n\n**Form Tip Reminders, From the Bottom Up:**\n\n* As always, cambered hands.\n\n* Arms locked straight\n\n* Shoulders shrugged up to your ears\n\n* Chest pushed toward the wall, to open the shoulder angle\n\n* Contract your Abs to flatten your ribs down to the best of your ability\n\n* Posteriorly Tilt your Pelvis to get as flat a lower back as possible (It may help to squeeze yo' booty muscles/glutes)\n\n* Squeeze your legs together very hard, so if someone were to walk up and try to pull your legs apart (very good partner drill, in fact) they would not be able to\n\n* Lock your legs straight\n\n* Point your toes\n\n**Other Things:**\n\nKeeping up with these videos weekly has been a bit of a fun struggle as I'm currently doing exams but hopefully I'll be set to release part 3 same day next week, which is either going to be on back-to-wall handstand training and how its good and why its also not good sometimes, or on toe/heel pull drills for balancing the handstand.\n\nI'm also working on some wrist flexibility/strengthening article (+ maybe video) so that might come out this week or next week to go along with the handstand training but who knows with my schedule at the mo'.\n\nIf anyone missed part 1, it's on the Hollow Body Hold and you can watch it **here**: [Hollow Hold Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n07aKcHZlkY)\n\nHope you guys like this series! If you have any extra tips or critiques or ways I could improve the series I'd definitely appreciate hearing them!\n\nIf you have any requests for things to go in this series or in another tutorial I'm always hungry for new video ideas, so go for it!\n\nThanks,\n\nNick-E\nprofuseflyingfish: What do you mean by cambered hands? \n\nThanks for the tips btw! \nCaptain_Nachos: Cambered hands mean you are digging your fingers into the ground like claws. Instead of having your fingers flat you have your middle knuckle of each finger slightly raised off the floor which gives you more purchase and pushing force against the ground which is good practice once you move to freestanding as it will be one of the main methods of balancing.\nAlexanderEgebak: Is there really a benefit to cambered hands? The more you \"camber\" the less contact you will have to the surface. If you have normal finger strength I believe the cambering and less contact with the floor will even out your handstand potential.\nCaptain_Nachos: It allows you to push harder with your fingers. Your palms will stay flat on the floor. Having your fingers flat massively reduces your ability to use your fingers to correct an over-balance. Not having your middle knuckle on the floor, at least in my experience has not reduced my ability to balance at all, especially considering the weight should be on the ball of your hand, not directly on your fingers\nAlexanderEgebak: Splaying your fingers will give a larger surface of contact. I am speculating whether or not splayed fingers position is easier to rebalance from than cambered. I guess that may vary according to the relative finger strength and hand/wrist proportions. I have not heard any conclusive evidence that cambered hands are the strongest position for the handstand.\n\nBeing a former volleyball player myself I have plenty of finger strength and do planche leans with cambered handstands, however not handstands.\n", "prompt": "Captain_Nachos: How to Handstand Pt 2 - Chest to Wall Handstands; Including Form Tips + How to Enter/Exit safely!\nHey guys, part 2 of this handstand tutorial series is out, this time its on chest to wall handstands.\n\n\n**LINK TO VIDEO HERE:** https://", "orig": "youtu.be/fOy7sE1_vI0\n\n\n\n**The Chest to Wall Handstand**\n\nChest to Wall Handstands are a super important progression and tool for your handstand training.

You still have to be there for your kid. They need to know they can rely on you and that you won't let them get harmed. Don't let your toddler cry for half an hour in their crib to \"teach them to deal with negative emotions\" or ignore your 10 yro being bullied because he needs to stand up for himself.. on his own.

There is such a thing as a happy medium, and there is also wiggle room from the happy medium to be a good but faulty parent. Then if you move away too much on either sides of the medium you are a toxic parent, no matter the direction.\nvalve_stem_core: I agree that there is such a thing as a happy medium but you are writing from the prospective of one side.\ntrowawaywork: It's lifehack, It's never gonna apply to everyone, every situation.

{"full_text": "humdrumdummydum: YSK that being dehydrated drops your blood pressure which can make you feel depressed. This can also cause your heart to beat harder, causing anxiety.\nWhy YSK: if you are already prone to depression or anxiety, dehydration makes it feel much worse, and it's so easy to do by accident. Because you don't have enough volume of blood, its harder for your body to maintain blood flow. This causes your body to mimic the symptoms of depression (fatigue, brain fog, dizziness), which can cause you to think the depressed thoughts, causing your brain to make depression chemicals. When that makes you feel shitty enough, your heart will try to fix it by beating harder, raising your blood pressure, mimicking anxiety. Additionally, it becomes harder for your blood to carry oxygen, making you breathe harder, which for me is the one that causes me to panic.\n\nThis isn't a WoW tHaNkS iM cUrEd, but for me personally makes a huge difference. For hours today my anxiety was unmanageably high for no particular reason. After an almost-breakdown I chugged 20oz of water, took a few deep breaths, and 20 minutes later felt so much better it spawned me to write this.\n\n[source](https://nopanic.org.uk/dehydration-anxiety/)\n\nThis message brought to you by r/hydrohomies\n\nEDIT: lots of people being skeptical because I linked a \"blog\" (an anxiety-focused charity), so here's your scholarly article, [Effects of Dehydration and Rehydration on Cognitive Performance and Mood among Male College Students in Cangzhou, China: A Self-Controlled Trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603652/#:~:text=As%20a%20conclusion%2C%20dehydration%20had,memory%2C%20attention%2C%20and%20reaction.).\n\nSorry for using such unscientific terms as \"shitty\" and \"depression chemicals\" on reddit of all places. Also can someone point out where I say depression isn't real and people just need to drink water? it's not like I'm telling people to replace their meds with hydration jeez louise \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\nandrewluck_andrew_lu: YSK you shouldn\u2019t take advice from posts that use phrases like \u201cdepression chemicals\u201d. \n\nThis may or may not be true, but there\u2019s no reason based on this post to believe that it is\nThe_Skydivers_Son: While I agree that \"depression chemicals\" isn't a particularly encouraging sign, the base advice of this is \"be hydrated, it might make you feel better\".\n\nIf someone follows the post to the letter, the worst-case scenario is that they'll be hydrated and depressed.\n\nInternet medical advice is only bad if it has the potential to negatively effect health.\nMembank: No worst case scenario they end up with polydipsia and end up in the hospital if they think \"the more water I drink the happier I am\"\nThe_Skydivers_Son: Ok then.\n\nIf you think that an internet post about the benefits of being hydrated is going to give someone a severe mental illness, there's not much I can do to help you.\nMembank: It's not a rare mental illness, it is commonly seen in people with schizophrenia but is also more common in people with anxiety (people who are anxious they are not getting enough water) and occurs in up to 20% of psych patients. \n\n\n\nAll posts like this do is spread misinformation and encourage potentially dangerous behaviors. \n\n\nI can tell you are not a medical professional, so maybe don't act like you know what you're talking about.\nThe_Skydivers_Son: You're right, I'm not a medical professional. Are you?\nMembank: I am, and it's not some rare condition for people with mental illness. \n\n\nLook at the other replies in this thread of fellow doctors and what people with actual education on the subject are saying.\nThe_Skydivers_Son: Okay, you got me.\n\nI'm not a doctor, you are (supposedly, this is Reddit after all). Polydipsia isn't rare (I edited my comment to reflect that).\n\nI'll even grant that the OP is strong in its claims, and potentially could have been worded better.\n\nThat said, I have a very hard time believing that a post pointing out the potential negative effects of dehydration is really that actively harmful.\n\nCan you provide a source to back up your claim that this post is so likely to cause a mental illness that it outweighs the benefits of the advice?\n\nAnd to head you off, this isn't the same as the Tide Pods challenge or social media-related depression. Your claim is that basic \"drink enough water\" type posts can actively cause mental illness - prove it.\n\nI think it's far more likely that your perception of the negative impact of posts like this is actually a survivorship bias - people who are prone to obsessive thinking might latch onto such a post to obsess over, but their problem is the obsessive thinking, not the random thing they're currently obsessing about.\nMembank: Posts like this absolutely do not help though. I see way too many patients who do something stupid because something they read online. It can be as \"harmless\" as saying that being dehydrated can make you depressed. \n\n\nThey literally wrote \"Someone who is experiencing low energy and fatigue due to low blood pressure may then experience sadness due to the association of the physical and psychological response.\n\nSomeone with preexisting depression who then also experiences low blood pressure (one cause of which is dehydration) could, I am deducing, experience a worsening of their fatigue and low energy, which could potentially cause worsening of sadness as well. As these are depressive symptoms, this constitutes a worsening of depressive symptoms.\" which goes a lot further than just pointing out a potential negative side effect of being dehydrated.\nThe_Skydivers_Son: That literally is a potential negative side effect of dehydration.\n\nAlso, please reread my comment about survivorship bias. You have yet to provide any solid evidence that this kind of post could cause harm to a healthy individual, other than your own skewed perspective.\n\nIf your argument is that we should police Reddit advice posts to protect people who are so mentally unstable that such a post causes them to harm themselves, I would argue that a better solution would be to police that person's access to the internet, which is full of obsession-inducing claims.\n\nAnd I strongly disagree that this post is unhelpful. I actually went through the exact issues described by the post over the last week or so, to the point that I called out of work because of anxiety. Nothing made me feel better, until I drank a bunch of water and got rehydrated. I immediately started feeling better.\n\nIt was only after that all happened that I saw this post, which helped me connect the dots, and now I have another tool to help manage my mental health. I'm confident that others likely benefitted in a similar way. I'm also confident that more people benefitted than were sent into obsession.\nMembank: Except there is no actual evidence that water helps anxiety and you don't have to be severely mentally ill to harm yourself.\n\n\nAgain you are talking about things you do not understand.\nThe_Skydivers_Son: I'm not sure what you mean by \"things I don't understand,\" because so far all you've really done is tell me you're right because you're a doctor.\n\nFor someone who claims to be a doctor, you don't seem to care much about evidence or even just standing your ground and justifying your claims logically.\n\nThe specifics of your claim changes every time you comment, you never address my requests for clarification/elaboration, and you still haven't provided a shred of evidence to support your claims.\nMembank: OK kid, you have fun with figuring out what I'm trying to say.\nThe_Skydivers_Son: Still not going to pony up any evidence? That's disappointing.\nMembank: Evidence of what, when you make a claim you support it and without evidence it can be dismissed without evidence.\n\n\nThe OP and you have said that dehydration can cause or worsen depression and did so without evidence, I'm dismissing that claim with the same amount of evidence.\nThe_Skydivers_Son: OP provided a research article.\n\nI'm still waiting for evidence to support your claim that posts like this cause mental illness and/or harmful behaviors.\nMembank: A research article which does not support the conclusion they stated, like at all. \n\nI never said posts like this cause mental illness. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563217303357 Here is a study looking at eating disorders in relation to online posts about them being harmful in offline behavior. \n\n\nAnd there is a large part in clinical experience seeing people be effected by things that people read or see. \n\n\n\nBut I'm done bothering with this. You are a literal child with no training in mental health trying to argue with somebody who does about the harm of misinformation on people with mental illness. Stop being a fucking twat.\nThe_Skydivers_Son: I'm not sure why you're so angry at me for engaging in a good-faith debate with you. I have no illusions that I'm in any way qualified to be a practicioner, but that doesn't justify your ire towards me.\n\nWe're having a no-stakes conversation about a hydration post on the internet, and I'm fully capable of understanding and participating in such a debate. I'm not going to kiss the stethoscope just because you claim to be a doctor.\n\nIt should be a cakewalk for a trained mental healthcare professional to clearly explain and defend your point to \"a literal child\" on the internet.\n\nIf I were your patient, I would expect the same degree of explanation from you, because \"I'm a doctor, shut up\" isn't good enough.\n\nThanks for the source.

{"full_text": "delpriore77: CMV: Solitary confinement should be considered cruel and unusual punishment and outlawed.\nSolitary confinement (SC) is torture in my eyes. The effects that SC had on the mental health of the prisoner is very well documented, as well as the increase in physical and sexual abuse from guards. Locking someone up for 22-24 hours a day with no contact with other people and no stimulants is cruel. Sadly, in the US it\u2019s not that \u201cunusual\u201d given that there are over 80,000 prisoners in SC today. I have seen no evidence that locking someone up in SC for extended periods in anyway assists in the rehabilitation of a prisoner. It deteriorates the psychiatric condition of  the inmate and does not work as a long term deterrent. I have also seen statistics that say [states that decrease their use of solitary confinement see significant decreases in prison violence. ](http://princetonspear.com/7x9-fact-sheet)Solitary confinement also disproportionately affects African Americans, members of the LGBT, religious minority, and the mentally ill.  \n\nSo we have the 8th amendent violations that SC encompass, SC is shown to not be effective and the decrease in its use has many positive effects, and it disproportionately affects minorities. On a totally different area, the costs of SC  can reach $77,000 or higher per prisoner. \n\nSolitary confinement has no place in the prison system, especially if the goal is eventual rehabilitation. \n\nEdit: added a word. \nMechanicalEngineEar: it is my understanding that solitary confinement is often used when the inmate has already proven they cannot get along with the general population in the prison.  Sometimes this is to protect that inmate by keeping people who would harm them away from them, but often it is to keep violent inmates from harming others.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am really curious how keeping an inmate locked up alone 22-24 hours per day increases sexual abuse?  how is an inmate who is isolated being sexually abused?  \ndelpriore77: Solitary confinement is used for many reasons. Two of the main reasons is for the protection of over inmates from that prisoner and protection of that prisoner from other inmates. My belief is that the use of solitary confinement for any reason cruel and should not be used. Prisoners in solitary confinement are more likely to face sexual or physical abuse from guards, not other prisoners. \nMechanicalEngineEar: do you have any stats to back this up as it seems unlikely.  \n\nfirst off, where would these reports even come from?  are the prisoners being sexually abused and telling the guards and the guards are reporting it up the chain and making it officially documented but not doing anything about the guards who are abusing them?  or are there just so many guards who love sexually abusing prisoners that they can't fire the bad guards fast enough?  why would solitary make prisoners more likely to be sexually abused?  if it is being reported it obviously isn't secret so what is stopping it out of solitary?  guards can still go into individual cells in general population in the prisons, it isn't like prisoners sleep in big 20 man cells if it isn't solitary.\n\nOr are the prisoners claiming sexual abuse?  once a prisoner is in solitary, why wouldn't they lie to try to get something out of it?  it isn't like it can get much worse for them.  If I was in solitary and didn't like it and I heard that crying \"sexual abuse\" would get me a nicer place I would cry wolf on day 1. \ndelpriore77: https://www.afsc.org/resource/solitary-confinement-facts\n\nI don\u2019t understand what your argument is or what route you are attempting to take  to change my view. That prisoners are lying about being sexually abused in order to get out of solitary confinement? What often ends up happening is when prisoners report sexual abuse, [they are put in SC as punishment. ](https://truthout.org/articles/for-people-behind-bars-reporting-sexual-assault-leads-to-more-punishment/) I don\u2019t know exactly how these statistics are acquired but I imagine on the same way most prison life statistics come from, from current and former prisoner and officers testimony. \n\nAnd prisoners that aren\u2019t in solitary also face sexual abuse from guards but it is obviously easier to do when there are no other witnesses and the prisoner doesn\u2019t have the ability to get help. \nClearlyBanned22: Your first source says literally nothing about increased instance of harm (especially sexual assault by the guards) for SC. \n\nYour second source shows that a person was sexually assaulted and was put in solitary for protection. \n\nWhich apparently was valid, since she was physically attacked the moment she returned to general population. \n\nWhat is your alternative to separation and isolation as protection?\n\nAs for your sexual assault claim. Since you have nothing at all to support it, you may want to reconsider using it as a foundation for your belief system. \nsomepoliticsnerd: Well the second one shows the wider problem in how she was treated. First, given that we know solitary is a terrible experience, why is the one *reporting* the assault put in solitary? Wouldn\u2019t you protect them by putting the accused in solitary?

If you are serious about training and eat accordingly you will notice measurable results (ie you can do 1-2 more pushups or whatever) in maybe 2 weeks. And if you say start eating properly and exercise then your muscle may store more water and whatnot. So you may have a quick antithetical result as well.\nHowever if you have more bodyfat initially, then your visual results may come a bit later.\nlegatostaccato: yeah that's fair. i'm fairly lean now, though dreading going back to a skinny-fat \"look\", hehe. hopefully bulk will go well in a week or two when i start. got a clean diet at least.\n", "prompt": "ColoredMarxers: 6 Month Progress, full BWF, M/18/5'8\"/125-140~\nHello Everyone, \nlast November I started my journey into BWF with a doorway pullup bar and the muscle mass of a 12 year old girl. 6 months later I", "orig": "would like to say I have made alot of progress.

{"full_text": "tsf97: Optimal hanging rest for pull-ups (extreme endurance)\nHi all,\n\nI've been training endurance for 10+ years but in the past couple of months specifically I have been working to hit 100+ pull-ups (PR is 115 but was an anomaly) with hanging rest (basically where you can shake out your arms) and am wondering what the best split of sets between hanging rests are.\n\nI usually do about 30-40 in a row and then switch to hanging rest, do sets of 10 until about 60-70, and then do sets of 5-8, but once I hit 100 my grip always runs out after about 8-12 minutes of hanging. Today I tried splitting them up into sets of 8-10 from the get go to not wear my grip out too much at the start, but the same issue still occurred where after about 9 and a half minutes my forearms were so pumped I couldn't even hold on to the bar with one arm. It always happens very suddenly as well, up to 95 my arms feel completely fine and then when I try and hang after my last set my hand literally feels as though it's about to rip off the bar. I tend to randomly alternate between chin-ups and pull-ups because chin-ups are harder on the grip but easier to perform reps, but pull-ups are much harder to engage my scapula after hanging. I ALWAYS hang with the pronated grip though because hanging with reverse or even neutral grip causes way too much swing.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on splitting the reps up into chunks/how long you should shake your arms out for between sets? I can easily dead hang for 20-30+ minutes alternating arms without doing pull-ups (basically until I get a rip in my hand) but it seems like after 10 minutes of doing pull-ups I get too much of a pump to continue.\n\nI completely get this is a bit of an extreme question but I was hoping someone who also trains endurance pull-ups and could help.\nConan7449: I'm curious what else does your workouts consist of?\ntsf97: I do one strength and one endurance session per week per muscle group.\n\nStrength I focus on very low reps and heavy weight, endurance I focus on as many reps as possible with my own bodyweight.\n\nOn my pull strength I do heavy weighted pull-ups (60%+ of my bodyweight) and one arm pull-ups, on my pull endurance I tend to go for things like 10 sets of x reps or trying to see how many pull-ups I can do in 30 minutes. I also do a lot of dead hanging with both one and two arms because grip is always what fails before anything else. \n\nLegs I just do a lot of plyometrics and light squats. I run a fair bit too.\n\nFor push I do dips, Russian dips, push-ups, one arm push-ups, handstand push-ups, and so on. Again on my strength exercises I tend to go for heavier/harder exercises and lower reps, vice versa for endurance. \n\nMany people always just exclusively do weighted once they get strong and stick to 5-10 reps because that\u2019s what drives hypertrophy but I think training muscular endurance is very important and much more functional for sports like gymnastics, climbing, bouldering etc.\nLucianU: &gt;Many people always just exclusively do weighted once they get strong and stick to 5-10 reps because that\u2019s what drives hypertrophy but I think training muscular endurance is very important and much more functional for sports like gymnastics, climbing, bouldering etc.\n\nI'm with you on this.\n\nI've actually been exploring doing only static holds. But with one very important principle: \n\nI don't hold them until muscle failure. I hold them until it becomes mildly unpleasant. \n\nBasically, I try to avoid causing too much pain and consequently aversion. The reason is that, the more aversion there is, the more I'm fighting myself to keep going. And I don't want to be fighting myself. I want my entire self behind what I'm doing.\n\nI've learned some things from doing this:\n\n\\- in each session, different muscle groups are the ones to give out first. I'm assuming some muscles adapt to the effort, thus revealing underlying weaker muscles.\n\n\\- with enough practice, I feel I can hold certain positions forever. It's like with enough adaptation, the recovery capacity of the muscles matches the exhaustion rate. So far, I have this experience consistently with standing and holding the arms in front of me.\ntsf97: Yeah I frequently get asked in my gym why I do so many high rep sets and why I don\u2019t train in the 8-12 rep range all the time. People don\u2019t get that not everyone is trying to be a bodybuilder or gain mass or bulk etc.\n\nInteresting (in a good way) strategy. I\u2019ve always done isometric holds as an after burner but never to reveal lagging body parts, but I can see how that would work; great idea. I haven\u2019t done isometrics in a while but I used to do a few sets of 1.5 minute pull-ups (45 seconds up, 45 seconds down) and it was utter hell but in the best possible way lol. \n\nI\u2019d say my biggest weakness are my shoulders, but I\u2019ve worked very hard on them over the last 6 months and even after so long training have made a HUGE amount of progress with push-up endurance. Because before my triceps and chest would feel ok but my shoulders would always burn like crazy. A lot of static holds like handstands and pike holds helped, but also just a lot of vertical pressing like handstand push-ups and even some military and incline press which was quite new for me.

PEDs don't up cardio-pulmonary endurance, proprioception, reflexes, muscle memory, skills or power which is what boxers train for. They largely decrease recovery or muscles to trigger more adaptations in a time interval. \n\nWhen he had back surgery recently his bone density was so high there were complications from damaging the tools and his bones being too hard to cut. That's from training so hard at a young age.\nMFFKraven: You think someone can train that much with good genetics only? PLEASE. At some point he used PED's, theres no doubt about it.

Tyson's training program was endurance first, hypertrophy as the result of having that work capacity. His soft tissues had tons of time to adapt to those stresses. It's just running, push-ups, dips, sit-ups and shrugs. Then sparring. And jump rope.  All limited by cardio which recovers much more quickly than weight training. \n\nCrossfit is much different.

Prolong the silence until they decide to be more kind to you.\n\n2. Turn away from them. Ignore what they are saying. Talk over them. Engage with another person in the group. Smile, be loud, warm and engaging with the other person and only engage when the rude person decides to say something positive. \n\n3. Compliment any behavior you **appreciate** and you will receive more of it. Pay more attention to the people who are being kind, than the ones who aren't.\n\n4. Talk about \"those types of people\", when discussing something they did. Letting them know you're not upset *yet*, but allowing them to save face and give them a chance to correct the behavior... while still calling them out in a subtle way. \n\nExample: Yeah, sometimes the people who look down on others for their appearance are actually just projecting their insecurities onto others. I feel bad for people like that, I wish they could be happy with themselves enough to be more positive. \n\n\nPeople do not like tension in conversation, so don't get rid of it while they are being mean.\n\nNot a fix-all but simple things you can do to make the conversation go in your favor and be a more pleasant experience for everyone.\nFL-Irish: Great tips! Also it's very important to have a confident vibe. I always have a slight smile (genuine), with open, approachable body language. I give good eye contact to whoever's speaking. I try to engage others around me, using their name at least once. I will touch people (lightly) in a neutral spot like the arm while I'm making a point. (not repeatedly. A little goes along way when it comes to touching! But it seems to affect people positively)  I bring an enthusiastic vibe to my interactions.\nPickledSpaceHog: Yes absolutely! Confidence and body language can go such a long way. \n\nI just know that in helping a few of my friends, they weren't sure on how to exude confidence or get nervous and don't have super great body language.\n\nAnd I am so uncomfortable with physical touch even though I know people probably enjoy it. I just don't want to encourage them to touch me at all. Lol \n\nSo, I wanted to have some steps people can actively take during conversations that didn't really include *feeling* a type of way. \n\nBut you're totally right it is important!

On top of that a cheetah expends an absolute ton of energy chasing it\u2019s prey and after killing its prey will spend a significant amount of time in the shade cooling off and recuperating energy before eating. All of this means that when a cheetah makes a kill that there\u2019s a significant amount of time where a cheetah doesn\u2019t have the energy to defend its meal nor does it had the body to stand and defend its meal anyway so it has to be on edge for any wandering hyena, leopard, lion, group of particularly irritable baboons etc. hence the eternal nervousness and on edge-ness\nwanna_try8: This describes my small house cheetah very well.

Even for 2011, the sword play or handheld weapons are just horrible to use. There isn\u2019t any skill involved what so ever, literally just swing until it\u2019s dead.. it\u2019s also extremely clunky and uncomfortable in my opinion. \n\nThe story, or lack of, is just boring. I wasn\u2019t compelled to it what so ever, no meaningful characters and I\u2019m not drawn to any of the side quests like I was in the Witcher for example. I know the Witcher is a game based off its story, but I\u2019d still feel if Skyrim had a better story it would improve the game massively. \n\nThe open world is phenomenal but the world itself just fell flat for me. Lifeless villagers and boring dialogue. I simply cannot comprehend how people call this game a \u2018masterpiece\u2019, while I do respect that it is still a good game.\nBillionTonsHyperbole: I haven't played video games since the late '90s. Simply haven't had any interest. I've heard the name *Skyrim* but know nothing about it at all.\n\nIf I were to sit down and play this game, would it be \"overrated\" from my perspective? Would I consider it to be a \"masterpiece?\" My memory of video games doesn't include a lot of dialogue or villagers (*Final Fantasy VII* maybe?), but I'll bet *Skyrim* would be far superior by comparison.\nDeliciousMelons: That\u2019s fair, if you haven\u2019t played games like Skyrim before, you may think it\u2019s a master piece. But I have played similar games, fantasy open world RPGS, that made the world feel a lot more immersive. That\u2019s why I believe the game is overrated, compared to other games in the same genre.\nBillionTonsHyperbole: Does the subjectivity of one's experience change your view at all? \n\nAnother example: I might find a Rubik's Cube flat and boring, but there's no denying that it's a masterpiece of a puzzle toy. I can appreciate it for what it is, how it's engineered, and certainly for its important place in the popular zeitgeist of Top Toys even if I personally find it to be lacking when it's in my hands.\nDeliciousMelons: Very interesting! However I don\u2019t see how this has anything to do with Skyrim being overrated. I believe Skyrim is a good game, I\u2019m not disputing that. But when compared to other games of the same genre, it falls flat for me. I believe there\u2019s a bias behind a lot of people\u2019s view of the game simply because it\u2019s rated so highly in the first place.\nBillionTonsHyperbole: It has to do with your subjectivity of experience. The \"Wisdom of the Crowd\" has apparently deemed that both the Rubik's Cube and *Skyrim* are masterpieces, at least for the time being. If you don't go for that, then that's fine, but they have still earned their very high ratings.\n\nSimilarly, many people will tell you that *Citizen Kane* is the greatest movie ever made. Plenty of people find it boring, but sufficient numbers of aficionados, experts, reviewers, and everyday film buffs rate it so highly that it maintains its position. Opinions will differ, but the designation remains.\nDeliciousMelons: You\u2019re right, opinions will differ. Views are typically based off opinions.

It still seemed huge, but this is for a very large dog, so we went with it.  \n2 -2x4 cut to 48\u201d\n2 - 2x4 cut to 33\u201d (to fit inside of the 48\u201d pieces, will complete the outside of the frame)\n2 - 2x4 cut to 33\u201d for joist supports\n6 - 5/8\u201d x 6\u201d x 8\u2019 Cedar fence posts(cut to 48\u201d for deck boards, {save what you cut off to be used later}\n2 - handles of your choice\n1 - 1 pound box of Deckmate 1 5/8\u201d screws\n**Will need (36) 2 1/2\u201d screws for the frame, wall posts, and roof supports**\n\nBuild your frame as illustrated in the video (16 2 1/2\u201d screws needed for this step).  The bottom of the frame is shown so you can see how the frame 2x4\u2019s are secured together.  Joists were placed at 16\u201d and 32\u201d from one (48\u201d) side for even spacing and support.  Cut your deck planks to 48\u201d and use your 1 5/8\u201d screws to secure the deck boards to the frame.  Don\u2019t bury your screws in your boards or they will have a lot higher likelihood of splitting which is not awesome.  Cut your front and back deck boards to accommodate your 2x4 posts for your walls if desired or you can simply place your posts on top and secure them down with 2 2 1/2\u201d screws for each wall post, in to the frame.  You are going to want to tape measure they spacing of your posts at the top, once you have them set.  You are screwing right in to the frame, so the tops of your wall posts should be very close to, if not right on, your 36\u201d x 48\u201d measurement from your foundation.  We aren\u2019t building missiles here so it\u2019s no biggie if you aren\u2019t 100% square and plum, but for ease of construction and generally good practice, you should be.\n\nPosts were cut to 32 1/2\u201d in the front and 31 1/2\u201d in the back to provide a gentle slope for water drainage as needed {and to make the front an even 36\u201d tall (remember, I cut my front and back deck boards out for the post.  If you don\u2019t do this, your measurement will be different to get a 36\u201d tall front of your dog house).  Back wall boards should be cut to 49\u201d (to allow a clean overlap so your corner looks nice and has minimal airflow).  Side boards shall be cut to 36\u201d each, 5 per side plus one more each side to rip down to accommodate for the slope in the roof.  You will see in the video that the tops of the side board (that I ripped down to accommodate for the slope) didn\u2019t match up with the front and the back boards.  This was later corrected on both sides.  2 cedar planks cut to 49\u201d for boards across the top of the front, 4 cedar planks cut to 28\u201d for the left of the door, and 4 cedar planks cut to 4\u201d for the right of the door.  Door opening will measure about 16\u201d wide and 20 1/2\u201d tall.  Screw 4 2x4 scraps inside to act as bracing for the roof supports.  Roof supports are 2x4\u2019s, cut to 36\u201d.  Secure the supports to the braces with 2 1/2\u201d screws, 8 needed for this step.  I cut the roof panels to 51\u201d to allow for a one inch overlap on the sides, once the side panels are installed.  As you can tell, we saved some money but using the tops of the pickets (which would have been waste) for roof pieces, and to give it a nice looking front &amp; top edge.  Line all of your panels up and screw them in place.  This dog house is under a covered patio so we aren\u2019t especially worried about water leakage at this point.

As you already extend One Leg it creates the illusion that you are really close the to full progression even though that is actually not the case. Usually, when someone is talking about the One Leg Progression they mean that you extend the other leg just like in an Advance Tuck Position, which on the other hand is actually really hard and much closer to the full progression. The reason for that if I am not wrong is that when you tuck one leg in you are actually rounding your back just like in the normal tuck variation and hence create an overall shorter lever and making the exercise easier. That and the fact the the exercise gets obviously harder as you keep on extending the other leg. I am not sure on which progression you currently are but you might as well try both next time and see the difference for yourself.

He was not wrong then and he is not wrong now, so I suppose you could argue that he is \"just as wrong\", as in completely correct... it's just a weird way to state it.\nBrother_-_John: Far be it from me to deny credit where it is due. \n\nOf course he was correct that the people hold Congress in contempt. (It needs to be said, however, that the Congress holds the people in contempt as well.) \n\nAdditionally, I don\u2019t know the details, but I got wind of a proposal of Bernie\u2019s that would forbid the US government from using facial recognition technology. That certainly seems something worth considering.\n\nHowever, nobody who lived through the bulk of the 20th century has any business being taken seriously while calling himself a socialist. At a certain point, you simply have to decide if people advocating such foolishness are evil or stupid.\nidlepe0n: \"He was right about this, and this, and this, but he calls himself a word that the TV tells me is evil, so I am going to ignore that he's always been on the right side of history and just make baseless claims that he is wrong and crazy.\"\n\nSound argument you've got there.\nBrother_-_John: &gt;He was right about this, and this, and this\n\nIf you'll reread more carefully, I identified one (1) point he made in that video that is too obvious for anyone to seriously ignore, and one (1) policy proposal of his, that I don't know any details of, that I think merits consideration.\n\nThe rest of your post is appallingly childish nonsense:\n\n&gt;but he calls himself a word\n\nHe identifies himself, and by extension, his policy preferences, with a political philosophy that destroys economies and kills people.  Hardly \"a word.\"\n\n&gt;a word that the TV tells me is evil\n\nNo, not the TV.  Is that the extent of *your* knowledge intake?  *Seriously?!*  I mean, even that is silly and unrealistic, because *most* of the TV favors most of his nonsense.\n\n&gt;he's always been on the right side of history\n\nThat's exactly why he doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, and neither do you.  Ridiculous idiocy.  Anyone advocating the things that the Democrat party stands for gets credit for being a dangerous and evil demagogue or an empty-headed lunatic, neither of whom can be trusted with political power, but do not deserve to be taken seriously as intelligent political philosophers or leaders.\nidlepe0n: \"Blah, blah, blah, my opinions are more important than facts because I am snowflake who only uses Reddit to push Russian talking points in the middle of the night because I would be handed my own ass if I pulled this shit during the day.\"\nBrother_-_John: What in the blue fuck are you talking about?\nidlepe0n: The fact that you think the word \"blue\" is an insult is about the funniest thing I have seen all day. I'm done here since you obviously have nothing to contribute to the discussion beyond school-yard insults and uneducated opinions. If you come up with something worth my time then let me know; otherwise you're just another uninformed child who substitutes facts with feelings because you are raised to think that accepting you could be wrong about something will undermine whatever tiny bit of \"manhood\" you cling to in desperation.\nBrother_-_John: So let me get this straight.\n\nYou\u2019re going to tell me that Bernie Sanders, a big fan of the Soviet Union, was on the right side of history, even as you accuse me of repeating Russian talking points?\n\nAnd then you respond with nothing more than bloviating idiocy about being personal or insulting?\n\nThis is *Twilight Zone*-level cognitive dissonance here. \n\nYes, I think we are done. I am forced to conclude that you are either too stupid or ignorant to waste anymore time on, or simply aggressively lying for some reason I am on interested in.\nidlepe0n: I would love to see proof that Sanders was a \"big fan of the USSR\", and I am talking legitimate sources. Second, present-day Russia and the USSR are not the same thing. Third, just because the third \"S\" in USSR is \"Socialists\" doesn't mean Sanders championing Democratic Socialism is the same thing. If you would like an example of how a word can mean two different things, I invite you to look at the differences between America's democracy versus that of the Democratic Republic of Congo. \n\nSee how I just responded with actual facts and examples? Now you come back with pathetic insults and more nonsense in an effort to get me to prove how stupid you are again, even though it is glaringly obvious to anyone who graduated high school.\nBrother_-_John: Given that you\u2019ve given me cause to believe you intend to vote for Mr. Sanders, I urge you to do your homework. I\u2019m not doing it for you.\n\nYou can also can the nonsense about the difference between this-or-that variety of socialism.  Socialism is basically socialism, with varying degrees of coercive force that grows out of the barrel of Mao\u2019s gun, and what you think you are voting for in the Nordic countries isn\u2019t really socialism, and you won\u2019t get what you think you will anyway. \n\nA rule of thumb is whenever you see \u201cdemocratic republic\u201c you should first think \u201ccommunist dictatorship,\u201c and if you are going to try an apples/oranges comparison like that, find somebody else to talk to. We already agreed this was going nowhere and that we should wrap it up.\nidlepe0n: More feelings and assumptions, not a single fact to back up any of your claims. You are nothing but a sad troll who makes baseless claims from the safety of anonymity and who, when unable to refute someone else's point or back up their own, shoves aside any bit of integrity they may have had for the sake of word games and school-yard insults. \n\nUntil you provide evidence of the cpaims you have made against Sanders, I am done wasting my time watching you cower behind a tenuous grasp of the English language in defense of a tyrant and at the expense of a true American.\n\nTo you, \"democratic republic\" and \"US democracy\" are apples and oranges, but \"Soviet Socialism\" and \"Democratic Socialism\" are one in the same, and all you have to back that up is your \"feelings\". I don't care about your feelings, I care about facts, and you are as far from providing a single fact as Bernie is from ever having claimed to love Russia.\n\nTake this high-school debate shit elsewhere, this is for adult discussion.\nBrother_-_John: &gt; adult discussion.\n\nIndeed it is.

How much time do you spent daily and how much does it get you? \ncodie28: I would say I spend about 45 minutes a day and get around $10-12 per week. And the best thing about using PTC sites is that your earnings are growing\nAssholeInRealLife: Then you're making $2.28 per hour. Granted if you're enjoying the games maybe that's enough for you. Personally I'd rather get a (second) job at McDonald's and work one night a week for 2-3x the payout.\n\nEdit: minimum wage is currently 7.25, so one 4 hour shift will make you $29 before taxes. Taxes will be dependent on your total income from other jobs too. You have a smartphone, so let's estimate kind of high and say you're in a 30% tax bracket. That leaves 70% or $20.30 after taxes.\nswagglebutt: You'd rather work at McDonald's than sit at home on your phone/tablet/laptop?  I, for one, think this stuff is worth it.  I'm a nail polish addict, the average decent quality nail polish is about $6-$8 per bottle, and as I'm unemployed currently, I spend well over 45 minutes a day on my phone.  If I could take some of that time and basically earn myself a free bottle of nail polish every week or so, I would love that!  \nAssholeInRealLife: You'd rather spend 45 minutes a day, for a week (5.25 hours) to earn a single bottle of nail polish, than work **1 hour** at McDonalds to earn the same thing?\n\nThe truth is that unless your current usage of 45min/day is _already_ on boring games/crap that you won't miss by switching to _other_ boring games/crap, (e.g. you're actually spending 45m/day on Facebook, Reddit, etc) then what's going to happen is you'll continue to spend 45m/day on FB/Reddit/etc and add an additional 45m/day doing the extra boring crap, except now you feel like you have to, so that you can get the reward. You do FB/Reddit/etc for its content; you'll do the points apps for your personal carrot on a stick (nail polish).\n\nSo now you've doubled the time you're not paying attention to your SO/kids/whatever, or reading books, or whatever _actually healthy_ habits you may have, and literally all you have to show for it is an extra bottle of nail polish. Time is money. If you value your time at $2/hour, then I guess it's a fine trade off.\n\nSo yeah, McDonalds is not a glamorous job. You'd probably come home smelling of fry oil and with tired feet. But instead of making $2.28 per hour you've been making $7.25+. If my goal was to make a few extra bucks to cover my hobbies/habits, I would do the thing that maximized my ability to earn those things. I'm not above shoveling shit out of a ditch, if I want the carrot at the end of that stick bad enough. Anything else is just wasting time. Why work for $2/hour when you can easily earn the same rewards at 3x the rate?\n\nI am extremely fortunate to be able to value my time closer to $100-150/hour doing software consulting in my free time. But the point is that there are faster and easier ways to earn a buck. I mean, I guess you could do this on the toilet, so that's easy, but the time required to earn the same amount negates the \"easy\" factor for me.\nswagglebutt: Well... yes, I do spend most of my time playing mindless games.  I haven't read for leisure in a long time, and I don't play so much that I neglect to work out or do household chores.\n\nMy boyfriend works a 9-5, and when he gets home, he enjoys watching movies and playing *his* games, so there's more phone time for me.  (Not that we don't spend any time talking or enjoying couple time.)  We don't have kids.\n\nI'm not saying that this is the Best Thing Ever or the Coolest, Easiest Way To Make Money.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: Help needed in fixing a fence.\nOk, so this may be dumb, but here goes. \n\nMe and my father started fixing the fence door. Neither of us are handymen, but he's got a few years on me, so I just follow when he needs a hand.\n\nSo we were using these long screws to fasten the hinges to the gate post, and the gate. A few of them weren't going in, so he decided to leave it until the wood \"dried\". This was middle summer, and we were getting some rain.. so whatever.\n\nSo he's out, and I'm bored, so I figure i'll finish it up and fix a semi-broken board.\n\nNow it turns out these were for interior use only (1. does it matter?), and while removing the stripped bolts, the head rips off. \"Fine, whatever, i'll cut it off, align the door properly anyway, and start over.\" Removed the rest, cut off the bit so it's flush, and start over. \n\nThe first one I put in breaks half way while screwing it in.\n\nTo describe it, there's an inch of non-screw near the head, and an inch of screwy-ridges near the tip. they're copper coloured, and the sheared inside looks silver. The dust-cover box they came in says \"multi-purpose and flooring\".\n\nSo, the door is aligned the way it needs to be to not scrape the grass when opened, and now there's a broken screw jutting out where I need to put an actual whatever-type-of-fastener.\n\nHelp? Can I just use nails? Does it need to be these crappy screws? Are the screws at fault, or it is just too cold out to do this stuff?\n\n\nEdit : Also, if there's any suggestions on removing screws from a post that broke off and have been cut flush to the wood, I would love them.\njakkarth: Use vice grip pliers to remove the broken screw. Screws will last a lot longer than nails if you can manage to get them installed. The kind of screws you want are \"decking\" or \"exterior coated\" screws. If you have trouble driving them in, use a 1/8\" drill bit to predrill the holes. Go about the length of the screw minus half an inch deep with the drill bit, then drive the screw in the hole.\n[deleted]: Yeah, no exterior coated anything. A few rust coated screws about the same size/shape that I could clean off. \n\nThe nails are left-overs from when we (my neighbors and beer) put together a patio, but I can only assume (because the neighbour got them, not us) that they were rated for outdoors.\njakkarth: If they're not coated, they'll rot/rust. That'll lead to poor structural performance (your fence falls apart) and discoloration (black stains trailing down from the screw heads). In some cases the exterior rated screws are also stronger than their interior counterparts.\n[deleted]: What i'm taking from that is \"Exterior coated nails, though inferior to exterior coated screws, are preferable to interior coated screws\"?\njakkarth: That is my recommendation, yes. I would not build a fence for my mother using anything less than exterior coated screws, but given a choice between galvanized/exterior nails and drywall/interior screws, I'd go with the nails.\n[deleted]: Thanks, your mother is a lucky lady. I'm going to grab some exterior screws later in the day, and make sure to drill in some holes before I try to install 'em.\n\nAlso, the pliers didn't work to pull out the screw, it just stripped the screw more. So I cut it off. Is that \"ok\", or are there screw-removal pliers is should look into?\njakkarth: I'd probably leave it. The [vice grip](http://tungstencarbidefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vicegrip.jpg) pliers are my go-to for removing screws with broken-off heads, so if that didn't work you're probably better off just cutting it off.

It is not hard to buy healthy foods. At my local store brown rice is 18 cents a serving. Frozen veggies are 25 cents a serving. Canned beans are about 35 cents a serving. Canned tuna is 70 cents a serving. Dried lentils are 10 cents a serving. I can also get 7 pounds of frozen chicken breasts for 21 bucks. Lots of other options too. \nZorbick: Everything you listed takes effort to turn into a healthy meal.  People do not make home cooked meals as often anymore.  Modern society \"doesn't have time\" - really doesn't *make* time -  for that.\n\nSo even if healthy can be just as cheap as unhealthy, unhealthy wins because it has less time investment.\nGreyDeath: &gt; Everything you listed takes effort to turn into a healthy meal. People do not make home cooked meals as often anymore. Modern society \"doesn't have time\" - really doesn't make time - for that.\n\nI managed to get through med school and an Internal Medicine residency and had enough time to eat healthy. You can grill a chicken breast with lemon pepper seasoning in 10 minutes, while you microwave the veggies with a small amount of water to steam them. After that is done you can toss a decent salad in 15 minutes. That's a quality meal in less than half an hour. You have to make time. Plus, the items I listed can be cooked in larger batches on the weekend to make multiple, ready to eat meals. Ultimately, even if you have to rely on less healthy, processed foods, having good portion control will prevent morbid obesity. \nZorbick: I get what you're saying, but that is still more effort than a microwave dinner. And you will have more dishes afterward to clean. It's not impossible to eat healthy while being busy, it's just not the easiest so it doesn't happen as often.\nGreyDeath: People managed to do so in the past, when microwaves were not an option. And like I said, beyond that, even if cooking your own meals were not an option, limiting caloric intake to not be greater than your total daily expenditure is always an option. \npalebluedott: It's just not that simple, if it were the obesity epidemic would be falling not rising.\nGreyDeath: I know it's not simple, which is why I think boiling it down to just price is not accurate either. [Compared to other developed countries](http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/01/america-food-spending-less) the average US household spends less on food as a percentage of their budget, while at the same time we have a higher average income. Additionally, we now spend less compared to how much we spent 30 years ago. Food costs are at a near all time low, so I don't feel like healthy food being too expensive is the primary reason for the epidemic. Perhaps just the fact that unhealthy food is cheaper relative to healthy food is part of it, but then that boils to poor choices, meaning we should focus on education. \n\nYou pair that with a drastic decrease in physical activity due to multiple reasons (decrease in labor intensive jobs, increase in sedentary leisure activities like watching TV) and people are going to gain weight. But this is a complex behavioral problem that can't be boiled down to \"well people are too busy\" because its not true in other countries, nor was it true in our past. \npalebluedott: Well unfortunately here on reddit,  if you don't say exactly what you mean right out of the gate you're always inevitably bound to be drawn out so you can say it in depth.

For example, pushups are very difficult for me to do because it's hard to support myself with my legs in a pushup position.\n\nSorry if this violates rule 2. I've been wanting to start working out but haven't really been able to find any advice on it anywhere for someone in my situation.\nbipocni: I get downvotes every time I suggest this, but a simple pullup/dip workout is really all you need for the upper body.  Work up to 100 reps total each workout.  Once that gets easy, start adding weight.\nColoredMarxers: That is because most peoples goals focus around hypertrophy and strength. As soon as they hear something along the lines of \"30 minute abs\" or \"100 pushups a day\" They freak out because most of these programs are money/attention grabbing schemes, yet very rarely are they actually geared towards muscle endurance like they should be.\nbipocni: Unless I was in the business of selling chinup bars, parallell bars, rings or weight belts I don't see how I could profit from this.\nColoredMarxers: Oh no, I think you may have misconstrued my statement, i was simply mentioning that the reason you may have been downvoted is a knee-jerk response many people on this sub have built in concerning programs that *sound* like the one you suggested. I actually believe a sizable volume of dips and pullups (leg free workouts) would be beneficial and fitting for his goals/condition.\nbipocni: Yeah, it's pretty much the only two exercises that would work.\n\nFor otherwise healthy people you can literally just add 100 reps of weighted decline situps, and that's all the upper body strength training you need.  Add elbow conditioning and/or balance practice if your goals involve advanced calisthenics, but for simple strength/size it really is all you need.\nColoredMarxers: I would even go as far to possibly add some parallel bar or ring support work if he was up for it. Maybe even bar deadhangs for grip strength. It would be fun to integrate a little twist into a workout that could possibly get a bit tedious with time.\nbipocni: 100 dips &amp; pullups gets tedious like hill sprints get tedious.  It's hard, and it sucks, but you won't exactly get *bored*.\n\nDwas hangs and support work aren't strictly speaking necessary, but they could be fun.  There's also the capacity to do different *kinds* of pullups, like chins, mixed grip, neutral, offset, towel grip, ect.  Dips could at least be moved up to Russian dips occasionally.  There's definitely room for play, as long as the spirit of the thing is kept intact.\nColoredMarxers: 100% agree.

{"full_text": "quinyng: Why bullshit is no laughing matter.\n\nCirqueLeDerp: The author doesn't really define bullshit, other than saying that it's obscure, often contains buzzwords, and is generally the opposite of a clear, concise message that is very apparently truthful. \n\nSo in that case, how is bullshit any different from beauty? Beauty is hard to define; the only truth about it that I've come across is that it really is \"in the eye of the beholder\". Beauty is not crystal clear, it often is obscure and to a certain extent, does also contain 'buzzwords' of a sort, although they're more likely 'buzzimagery' like sublime natural scenes or poignant facial expressions, or 'buzzconcepts' like symmetry, contrast, or a pleasing use of space.\n\nSo my question is: if the author is correct in that more analytical, critical people are less susceptible to bullshit, why (or how) is there not a similar agreement or accord regarding beauty? Or if there is, how do you think those groups can be arranged relative to each other, i.e. are there 'lesser' and 'greater' forms/instances of beauty? \n\nAnd most importantly, is beauty bullshit? Or is at least some beauty bullshit? How do you tell the difference?\nfuadmins: I think most in this line of thought would say beauty is Bullshit. At least the societal definition. Everyone has their own sense of beauty and the dogma that is taught is for lack of a better word, Bullshit. Popular opinions passed down or simply concensus. Our group generalizations that have become ingrained in recent culture. (With the case of beauty we can see over history how even in the short term this concept can change greatly.) I'd go farther and say most everything said and done is Bullshit. We don't know. We are very sure of ourselves but really it's just farts in the wind. Every day we prove how wrong we were yesterday. And in that same breath we speak of how much we know today. We apply this same assuredness to every aspect of reality, for better or worse. We are walking talking Bullshit factories. I don't necessarily consider that a detriment or even a fault of humans but as what I've personally seen through observation. Perhaps it's even our greatest strength. These are my personal thoughts on the matter. \nfencerman: &gt; I think most in this line of thought would say beauty is Bullshit. At least the societal definition. Everyone has their own sense of beauty and the dogma that is taught is for lack of a better word, Bullshit.\n\nExcept that, empirically, that simply isn't true. There's a whole field of aesthetics and composition that studies the elements of what makes something beautiful, and it genuinely does hold up over time. Ancient egyptian monuments are beautiful, even if we have nothing in common with the society that built them; Beethoven's symphonies are beautiful across cultures around the world. Combinations of colours that are complementary are more beautiful than ones picked totally at random. \n\nYes, there's a lot of variation and disagreement over some of the specifics, but rejecting all ideas of beauty as mere opinion is simply wrong. \nfuadmins: Is it? Because I don't find human stone carvings or Beethoven to be particularly beautiful myself. Sculpture and paintings are seen as beautiful more through dogma than through our own eyes I'd argue. Classical music. Glorified artists and cultures. I think Egypt is a great example too. It's stone sculpture is no more impressive than anywhere else yet it's synonymous with beauty. I don't buy that, it doesn't work for me, and I know I'm not the only one. I think Egypt is a great example of the dogmatic beauty I was alluding to. I'm sure in the Egyptians time the art and style of previous even older cultures was held in high esteem as well. It's part of being human to glorify things then teach successive humans to blindly follow that belief. For example some would say, \"the Mona Lisa is the most beautiful piece of art.\" in reality it's a very tiny piece of art and in a museum of technically masterful expression it does not stand out. At least not to me. It's dogma. At least to me it seems so. \nfencerman: Yes, it is. \n\nUnless you want to claim you hate all music and art, and only listen to industrial scratching noises and look at pictures of the outlets of solid waste disposal facilities for entertainment, you're still looking at things and listening to things that follow the same general principles. \n\nIt's not dogma, it's a matter of real forms and patterns that genuinely do impact human perceptions in different ways. \nfuadmins: I disagree. I don't like a lot of art and don't consider it beautiful. You can't just say there are beautiful things therefore there is this law of beauty. There isn't. We're talking consensus here. As in a  agreement upon which could be agreed upon. Leaving what's left, everything else. That's the concept of beauty. It's bs. What is beautiful to me is not beautiful to you and vice versa. If there is a connecting law of beauty then share the info. If you can't determine why something is beautiful then you don't know what beauty is. That's the idea here. There is no universal definition of beauty. Only generalizations of specific things that not on their own or together with others may be perceived as beautiful. *May. Therefore anything called beautiful is purely opinion, dogma. It can't be proven to be beautiful. It can only be perceived to be.\nfencerman: &gt; I disagree. I don't like a lot of art and don't consider it beautiful. \n\nHow exactly are you defining \"beauty\" here? What's your experience of it? \n\nSo far all you're doing is just saying you don't like certain things - which is fine to claim, but if you're just going to be pointlessly cynical and deny applying that word to anything, then there doesn't seem to be much discussion worth having. \n\nThe colour \"red\" also refers to something that not everyone can see, but that's not a problem with the colour red. \nfuadmins: I'm allowed to not like certain things. I don't know how to explain fully what I define as beauty. It's not an easy thing. It's not very superficial for me. When I've come up with something I feel to be accurate to how I feel I will share. I'll remind you though you have the same burden of proof. Just because I say I don't like something doesn't mean, by what your stating, that you don't have to prove that all people do. That's what we're arguing about. Not my perception of beauty. But that beauty is a matter or perception and not some well defined law. It seems to me your arguing that certain shapes or depictions are not being perceived as beautiful but ARE beautiful. Is that what your meaning?\nfencerman: &gt; I'm allowed to not like certain things. I don't know how to explain fully what I define as beauty. \n\nNobody's saying you're not allowed to like certain things - but if you're going to make claims, the very least you can do is to give examples yourself instead of simply denying every example that's given. \n\n&gt; It seems to me your arguing that certain shapes or depictions are not being perceived as beautiful but ARE beautiful. Is that what your meaning?\n\nOne person's inability to perceive something doesn't mean it isn't there; deaf people don't disprove sound. So far the only things you've said is that you don't like anything that's been mentioned so far - if you literally don't like anything, period, then that might explain the issue. \nfuadmins: But what does it prove when you say you think Egyptian statues are beautiful and I say I don't. To me that would give credence to the idea of beauty being Bullshit. I find corpses to be beautiful. Do you? When they are bloated with maggots they sway with new life. I think that decomposition is a beautiful thing. Most people do not. Does that mean it isn't beautiful? Do you see the circle we're making?\nfencerman: &gt; But what does it prove when you say you think Egyptian statues are beautiful and I say I don't. To me that would give credence to the idea of beauty being Bullshit\n\nOr it might mean the same thing as when a colourblind person sees red as brownish grey. \n\n&gt;I find corpses to be beautiful. Do you? When they are bloated with maggots they sway with new life. I think that decomposition is a beautiful thing. Most people do not. Does that mean it isn't beautiful? Do you see the circle we're making?\n\nNo, some people find being beaten to be pleasurable; that means you need a more sophisticated notion of beauty or pleasure, not that those things don't exist. \nfuadmins: Well I find that definition of beauty to be a bit broad and all encompassing. Pleasure and pain are beauty. Up and down. The top of the knee the back of the knee. It's all a matter of perception. To each their own. As I've said. Beauty as a reality is bs. Perception determines beauty. Everyone perceives things differently.  You get the contradiction in statues both being beautiful and not being beautiful right? And your comment about my tastes or inclinations. Who determines what is more refined or better taste in beauty? Concensus, time, and dogma. More bs. Big blooming onion of bs with nothing but hot air in the middle.\nfencerman: I think you're missing the point - saying \"everyone perceives things differently\" is not actually a refutation of anything. That's equally true of sound and colour too. \n\nAnd you misread my statement about \"sophistication\" - I don't mean your taste is unsophisticated, I mean the definition everyone uses needs to be developed further. Like if you thought kittens are beautiful; you can't just say, \"therefore, beauty equals kittens\". You need to develop that definition further and figure out what it is about them that merits that definition. \nfuadmins: Well we disagree. No one's definition of beauty is the same. Maybe we can agree on that. To me this argument is a lot like if there is a god. Some people look at nothing and say there is god. Others say it looks like nothing. To the ones who see nothing the evidence isn't strong enough for god. For the believer the evidence isn't strong enough to disprove. In this case your the believer and I'm the skeptic. This argument I don't believe would go anywhere if we continued. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Defiantly interesting stuff. I wish you the best.\nfencerman: &gt; Well we disagree. No one's definition of beauty is the same. Maybe we can agree on that.\n\nNo, we can't, because there is significant agreement and even people who superficially disagree usually agree on a deeper level. \n\nIt's nothing like an argument about god, since it's discussing real perceptible experiences. You already admit you find certain things beautiful, so clearly you agree that there is some underlying reality to that experience, since you don't seem to consider yourself merely crazy. \nfuadmins: Even and usually aren't concrete enough to me. Sorry. Just generalisations of what is beautiful. Dogma. Popular opinion. I do believe there is a concensus of what beauty is. But it's used to sell you things and make an industry from nothing. That's a whole other argument though. Ponder this. Does beauty exist to the dumb, deff, and blind man? Does beauty need to exist? No. It's a concept used to describe reality. Not a reality we are describing.\nfencerman: &gt; Does beauty exist to the dumb, deff, and blind man? \n\nAgain - does the colour red? \n\nAre you arguing colours don't exist?\nfuadmins: To a degree yes. I'm actually color blind myself. So when you say red I know you mean grey. Ya know. So to you red is red and to me it's grey.  Not because either of us can detect redness but because we were taught that is red, or in my case, that grey is red. So in a lot of ways yea that's bs. It applies to you and you hang on to it. It doesn't apply to me. Color doesn't exist for me. I know that it does for other people. To me it's grey. When someone says they like a statue. I see rock. They see sculpture. They are arbitrary words describing reality. We both see the same thing. We call it red. You see it as red. I see it as grey. You can't describe what red is to me I have no context for color. It's just grey. You can't describe what beauty is either, all you can do is spread your own opinion or the dogma. So yea red doesn't exist as a color for a lot of people. For a lot like me it's one of many arbitrary words to describe what I see as grey. Beauty is similar. You see something  that makes your heart mushy and I see something that makes my bowls move. We're looking at the same thing. It's our perception that truly defines the thing.  Not the arbitrary word attached.\nfencerman: &gt; To a degree yes. I'm actually color blind myself. So when you say red I know you mean grey. Ya know. So to you red is red and to me it's grey. Not because either of us can detect redness but because we were taught that is red, or in my case, that grey is red. \n\nExcept that it does refer to something real - a specific thing that exists independant of either of our experiences, that can be described and verified. If you use that different experience to claim colour doesn't exist, you're simply wrong - colour does exist, even if we experience it differently. \n\nIt's not arbitrary at all, it's a matter of genuine capability to perceive something. The fact that you admit you see it differently because you are colour blind, instead of insisting that everyone else is crazy means you do know that colour is a real thing in the world. \n\nColour isn't a matter of dogma; it's real and exists. That's true even if you personally haven't seen it, and you've seen enough about the world to know that in this case, you really are the one that lacks the ability to see it. \n\nIf you had a point about \"dogma\" there would be nothing in common between cultures about the things anyone agrees that are beautiful - but again, that's entirely not the case. Completely different cultures, even ones which have never interacted before in history still have strongly overlapping ideas about beauty. \nfuadmins: OK so let's see your imperical evidence and experiments for determining if an obtuse angle is beautiful or not. Good luck. Until you've got some way to measure your just talking out your ass. There is no beauty-o-meter. We're looking at the same object. I say it's beautiful. You say it's not. Even if you go around the whole globe an ask every single person all you have is concensus. Beauty is objective not imperical. You can't measure it. You can't prove on paper that something is or isn't beautiful. All you can do is ask how many think that way and why. Plainly put your just wrong. That not peer reviewed science. That's opinion. Psduscientific. Yea beauty exists as a concept just like color. There is no beauty outside of humanity. Which lends more to its no existence. Beauty like art is simply human preference. Individual preference.\nfencerman: &gt; OK so let's see your imperical evidence and experiments for determining if an obtuse angle is beautiful or not.\n\nThat's like asking whether an obtuse angle is red. \n\n&gt;There is no beauty outside of humanity. \n\nThat's also a totally meaningless statement. There's no language without humanity, does that mean Shakespeare doesn't exist?\nfuadmins: This is why I chose accounting and not to be a educator lol. OK your a human you born on an island. No other humans. No contact. Does red exist for you? What of your concept of beauty. Totally different huh? That's because red, beauty, most descriptions. It's dogma. It's what you were taught to believe. You didn't share your perception which may be totally different. You were told. No. That's red. Sure looks grey to me. Concensus has to be right though huh? Also. You should be able to tell why an obtuse angle is beautiful. I didn't ask for its color. I asked why is that make up of lines beautiful. Why is that angle beautiful. Or why isn't it. That should be fully within the realm of something you could prove if beauty was something definable and provable in the first place.\nfencerman: &gt; This is why I chose accounting and not to be a educator lol. OK your a human you born on an island. No other humans. No contact. Does red exist for you?\n\nGood question - you're born on an island with no contact with anyone else, and you look at something that every other human being experiences as \"red\". So what colour is it? \n\n&gt;That's because red, beauty, most descriptions. It's dogma. It's what you were taught to believe. You didn't share your perception which may be totally different. You were told. No. That's red. Sure looks grey to me. Concensus has to be right though huh?\n\nYou could literally claim that about anything, but I've already described to you why that can't possibly be the case. \n\nNow - if two cultures had never contacted one another before, and never exchanged any information at all, would they have any reason to agree on anything that the other culture created as being \"beautiful\" or not? Yet there is in fact plenty of agreement on that issue - musically, artistically, etc. So \"dogma\" can't possibly be the explanation, simply using logic - they don't share the same dogma at all. \nfuadmins: Agreement is not proof of anything. People agreed the world was flat. Sure as hell wasn't. People agreed that having slaves was cool. Turns out not so much. (And on the subject of beauty. Fat used to be beautiful. It was a sign of prosperity. Now it's a sign of poor health. A small ass used to be the most sexy. Not so much anymore. People used to think men in drag looked like men in drag. Now they're beautiful.) To the guy on the island red doesn't exist. None of it does. Color and beauty aren't good things to measure against one another. Colors are arbitrary titles given to physical reality. The reflection of light is different on that object. I'll call it purple. Beauty on the other hand is a concept. It doesn't describe one reality but a broad scope of realities depending on the individual perceiving. As is what I said in my original comment. The question was is beauty bullshit. I say yes it is because noone agrees as to what beauty is because literally anything that exists can be beautiful it just depends on who's looking. In knowing that you realize beauty is not a quantitative thing. It can't be measured and is purely an opinion. In other words.... it's Bullshit.\nfencerman: &gt; Agreement is not proof of anything. People agreed the world was flat. Sure as hell wasn't.\n\nExcept that right now, you're trying to argue that the earth really was flat for the people who thought it was, because that was their \"experience\". I honestly hope you understand that. You might as well say that \"shapes are arbitrary titles given to physical reality\", and that claiming the earth is round or flat is meaningless. \n\nSeriously, that is exactly what you're arguing. The roundness of the earth is bullshit too, according to your logic, and it is purely an opinion. \n\nLook at the question in a more fundamental way: Is there any culture, or even individual, that has no concept of \"beauty\" whatsoever? Someone for which the very concept doesn't exist at all? No - literally no human being on earth can be described that way, short of them being a mental vegetable. So yes, there is absolutely some part of beauty that isn't simply dogma. \nfuadmins: No, you don't understand what I'm arguing. I've tried to be very clear. I just got off work so I have some time now to think and am going to make this crystal so we won't have to continue this conversation anymore. I am not saying that the world was flat for people who believe that it was. The point that I was trying to illustrate was that concensus does not have much merit and is wrong often. I was not meaning to tie that scenario in with beauty or perception. It was more to further emphasise that concensus and agreement mean nothing without a way to prove a correlation. The scientific process. I don't have to go over that with you. I was emphasizing this because all of your comments end with how there is agreement on this topic. Concensus as to what is beautiful. OK, so for the matter at hand. Beauty. Is it Bullshit? These are my thoughts. Beauty is immeasurable. It is broad and vague. We use it everyday from, \"oh that sunrise is beautiful.\" To *flush \"that shit was beautiful.\" Nearly anything you could think of (and I challenge you to do this of course) could be described as beautiful by someone, somewhere, for some reason. Now if all things can be beautiful then how can we determine what is or isn't? You have to make things more specific. It must have a context. As a student of history I know of the constant changes of cultural and societal norms over time. They evolve, develop, devolve, die, and can even be reborn. This ultimately is why beauty is Bullshit. Because the dogma or cultural perception is constantly changing through the voices of the prominent or the multitude. Which are individual voices with individual perceptions of what beauty is. All of our perceptions are different but they are all referencing the same physical reality. Now think on that. So the reality hasn't changed. Fat is still fat. An ass is still an ass. Etc. Yet the cultural perception of beauty has changed. Drastically in some cases. Now, is an ever changing definition, based on individual opinion, bullshit? I think so. Define what is beautiful yourself. It's a personal truth. What is true for me may not be true for you. Yet they both are true.\nfencerman: &gt; I just got off work so I have some time now to think and am going to make this crystal so we won't have to continue this conversation anymore. I am not saying that the world was flat for people who believe that it was. The point that I was trying to illustrate was that concensus does not have much merit and is wrong often.\n\nThe only thing that argument proves is that evidence matters. And your arguments are dependant on ignoring the evidence and logic. \n\nLook at your claim: any consensus on beauty is nothing but dogma. Okay, that's your hypothesis: how can you test it? What would that look like if true?\n\nThat would mean anything could be considered beautiful, and there would be no consistency whatsoever between cultures. Okay - there are significant variations, that is true. But how big are those variations, really? Consistently, things like symmetry, proportion, health, nature, life, etc... are constantly used around the world, with minor variations, and found beautiful even among those groups that have never had any contact with one another. Play beethoven for a remote amazonian tribe and they'll enjoy it. When natives and europeans came into contact they both saw beauty in one another's art. \n\nYes, culture influences perceptions and norms, nobody ever denied that, but there is absolutely something more fundamental at play. You're also ignoring the fact that there is no group of human beings anywhere that lacks a concept of \"beauty\" entirely - it's a concept every single group on earth is aware of, even if they have absolutely nothing in common at all. Therefore there is certainly something more fundamental than simple made-up conventions about it. \n", "prompt": "quinyng: Why bullshit is no laughing matter.\n\nCirqueLeDerp: The author doesn't really define bullshit, other than saying that it's obscure, often contains buzzwords, and is generally the opposite of a clear, concise message that is very apparently truthful. \n\nSo in that case, how", "orig": "is bullshit any different from beauty?

(And given the number of religious, non-science believers in the world, I would say it isn't even a reason.)\n\nModern science, at least, does its best to be anti-dogmatic.  You could say that reality is biased towards science, or something like that.  Most of science is testing theory against real world evidence.  That's the scientific method, right?   So science at its best assumes no truths/answers.  Most religions do, because most religions are based on generation after generation of experience, compiled into some sort of cumulative text.  So I think most religions began as pseudo-science, even before we called science by the word \"science\".\n\nFurthermore, science is not western.  It's western chauvinism to think that it is.  Non-western countries have just as much science, if they can afford it.  And many of \"western\" scientists hail from non-western countries.  In America, there are many, many, many grad students that came from outside the states, and many of those from non-western countries.  The fact that science \"travels\", as you say, is evidence that its truths are more universal.\n\nIn the end, we can't know completely for sure, but the evidence points to science.  There are some great defenses of science from philosophers.  The only one I can think of right now is Charles S. Peirce, in his \"The Fixation of Belief\".   It's a good question.

{"full_text": "thegreekie: Kitchen Tiling Questions/Run Through - 1st Time DIYer\nHi guys, \n\nI'm about to close on my first house and the first thing I want to do (before I put appliances in) is tile the kitchen. I'm a total DIY beginner but I have been reading up and watching videos on the tiling BUT I just want to run through my plan and ask questions beforehand to make sure nothing goes wrong. Just for reference, house is from 1999 so fairly new. \n\nCurrently there is vinyl in the kitchen (which looks like is over plywood - http://imgur.com/AGbdy4t ):\n\n1. Score vinyl with utility cutter. \n2. Peel up. \n3. Remove plywood (EDIT: someone said there's probably plywood there and needs to be removed) \n\nNow for actual flooring: \n\n1. Use modified thinset between subfloor and Ditra. Spread and stick it on. \n2. Use non-modified thinset above between Ditra and tile. (But must use latex additive for porcelain tile? Does it apply to ceramic as well?) \n\nSome general questions: \n\n1. How long does it take to dry between all the layers? I've heard it takes awhile - up to a week?\n2. How do I tile around/cut the tile to work for this vent? (By the window - http://imgur.com/3o1Zk0W) I have read some stuff about using a wetsaw, but is there no other way to do it? I am planning on using a snapper.\n3. I am planning on doing a diagonal pattern, are there any guidelines or suggestions where to start? (For example, for just straight squares it is recommended you start in the center and work outwards.) \n4. If I decide to go with Wonderboard instead, do I need pay attention to how I screw it down? Or just evenly spaced works? \n\nI would also like any recommendations on the following tools: \n\n-Tile snapper (or saw if that's better) \n\n-Modified Thinset (Someone recommended Versabond) \n\n-Unmodified Thinset (Someone recommended Laticrete ? on the actual one) \n\n-Places to buy cheap tile? (The best I've found is .86 ceramic tile that's on sale at HD) \n\nIs there anything else I've forgotten or failed to think of? \n\nThanks for any and all help!!\nsometimesUseful: So i cant help you with everything but i can give you some help.\n\n* The Tile snapper work great if you have to cut a tile in half or if you want to remove two or more inches.  Once you start to get to less than two inches its gets tricky or impossible.  I definitely recommend renting or buying a wet saw since you are doing a whole floor and thinking about a diagonal pattern.\n* The wet saw is also going to come in very handy once you get to that vent in the floor.  Sure you can do it with the snapper but you will have to cut the tile into many pieces instead and have seams in addition to grout lines.  Since this a vent you cannot cover it and everyone can and will see it.\n* I don't know if HD will do it but the last job i did was a little fireplace one for a friend and I needed some \"complex\" cuts that the snapper couldn't handle.  I measured them out and brought them to Lowes (I got the tile there) and they cut it for me on their wet saw for free.  If you don't do a diagonal pattern you might mostly need simple cuts (i.e. perfect for the snapper) and a few complex cuts the HD could do for you.\n* In regards to the thinset read the box and make sure its suitable for the material you are working with.  Also make sure you buy the correct trowel for the size tile you are working with.  It should say it on the box.\n* For the grout I have had great success with epoxy grout, just make sure you buy the right float for it.  Yup there are different floats for different grouts.\n* Buying tile at HD can be really cheap - it might be cheap because its being discontinued.  If that's the case make sure you buy extra, you never know when you are going to need to replace a cracked tile and you will never find more of it again.\n* IN regards to drying times check the boxes of the thinset and grout.  They are all a little different.  I think that was one of the big reasons I choose the epoxy grout last time, that and it didn't need to be sealed.\n* If you are at HD or any big box store find an old guy who works there and has a smile on his face.  Generally he is working there because he loves home improvement and has done everything you can ever think of.  There is a guy like this at the Lowes down the street from me in the tool section and he has never steered me wrong.\nthegreekie: Thanks for all the info! Hadn't even come across epoxy grout in my research. Did you use ditra or backerboard when you were doing your tiling? \n\nAlso, as for the tile snapper - is it not good for a diagonal pattern because of the numerous corner cuts needed? \nsometimesUseful: I cannot say i have laid down many tile floors but my understanding of ditra is that you want to use it in high water areas such as a bathroom due to its water proofing.  It is also supposed to be pretty good at preventing cracks in the tile due to the fact that its an \"uncoupling\" layer.  One of the big complaints against it is that its expensive, but if you have the extra cash and you want to do it then go for it.  If you have a solid sub-floor and its not moving or squeaking right now you might be safe without it.\n\nBacker board might be helpful if you are doing a back spalsh or need to make a flat surface to tile on, for example if you took the walls down to their studs.  If you are down to the studs make sure you buy something that's mold resistant, no one likes mold and if you can prevent it then spend the extra cash.\n\nWho knows i could just suck at using a tile snapper.  A contractor who installs tile for a living could probably snap file faster than I could get it out of the box.  Knowing that you are doing a whole floor you will and thinking about a diagonal pattern you will have to cut every tile that touches a wall.  Also i found it hard to get the exact angle I wanted out of the snapper so my OCD would be able to handle that on an entire floor.  Knowing how long it takes to snap one tile I feel like you could shave days off this project by getting a wet saw.  Dont buy the cheap one, rent the good one.  How many more tile floors are you going to install anyway.\n\nAlso since you need to cut on the diagonal if you get a snapper make sure your tile fits in there on a diagonal.  A 12\" tile is basically 17\" on the diagonal so if you don't buy at least the 18\" tile snapper you are shit out of luck.  Even at that, the way they snap is pressure after you score the top and if you put pressure near the corner, which is at the end since its a diagonal cut (where the snapper has the most leverage) there is a good chance you will break the corner.\nthegreekie: Someone recommended Ditra to me because it was easier. I could probably use backerboard as well. But I would need to remove that plywood right? Also, do you know how I would be able to tell the difference between plywood and subfloor? \nsometimesUseful: Plywood can be a sub floor or so can OSB.  Remember that the sub floor is just the floor below your floor.  Generally people will lay sheets of plywood over the joists likes bricks on a wall and then depending on the thickness lay down another layer so that it overlaps those seems.  OSB is the more preferred sub floor now since it seems to be cheaper, superior, and easier to install than plywood however its a newer product so depending on the age of your house you might not have it.\n\nThe house looks pretty nice and i assume its newer construction.  If that's the case whatever is down there for a sub floor was probably code, don't expect contractors to throw in anything more than they have to.  Removing any or it might weaken the structure of the house / floor.  Based on what I know i would probably remove the vinyl tile and clean the sub floor as best you can of all glue and then go with the ditra.  If you are going to do something and you aren't sure how much you have to do you might as well over do it so you don't have to do it over.

But I don't wanna lose my gains that I made at the working hard with weigh training all year. I know ill be more functional and stronger and healthier but I still like the progress I'm making with weight training. Wat do? I'm thinking about mixing the weight training and GB work but they might effect each others progress. Can i still hope to make any muscle gains while doing GB alone or at least not lose my gains so far  \nsantiagopinzon: Hey man, you may to have to give up some of the weight training, at least for the upper body. I bought the foundation programs and I think they are worth it-but with lots of modifications from your part based on the critics they have post it here. So for example you will find that they promote a kind of circuit training, you do a strength exercise, rest with a mobility exercise (which sometimes are really strength ones), and keep going like that with no rest. This and other things make the program good but only if you modify it. Everybody can say what they want about Coach Sommer, but he still was the first person to introduce to the masses all of the intricacies of gymnastics training in a systematic manner.\n\nAnyways, my point is that you can find ways to change the program to fit your needs. You could keep training your weighted stuff (I do) but realize that if you don't make some sacrifices your progress will be slower, but that doesn't mean non-existent :)\n \neshlow: &gt; Everybody can say what they want about Coach Sommer, but he still was the first person to introduce to the masses all of the intricacies of gymnastics training in a systematic manner.\n\nThat's debatable. Popularized? I suppose. Hyped? Sure. But popularized or hyped isn't introduced or invented or anything like that, which is what you'll hear a lot of GB people claim. Most people who have grown up in gymnastics find it laughable that he claims to invent progressions since we've been learning a lot of progression related things from our coaches who learned it from their coaches and so on.\n\nFor example, Roger Harrell's [Drills and Skills](http://www.drillsandskills.com) was around since 2000 or 2001. One of the first big gymnastics related websites on the Internet that I know of and participated in discussions with. \n\nEven Beast Skills has been around since 2002, and Sommer has claimed that Jim has ripped him off.\n\nThe first Sommer article which supposedly popularized gymnastics/bodyweight strength training was on Dragondoor around 2004, T-nation in 2005, and briefly with CrossFit in 2004ish.\nsantiagopinzon: Hey Steven, it's great to be able to have a chat in here! I won't fight over this-I believe you and I'm not a GB freak. It's only that many people tend to also be freaks about critics, either they are totally for or against something, and I wanted to outline the importance of Sommer (I know he didn't invent the progressions) as I prefer to take the best each thing has to offer and not close the doors for learning. \neshlow: All good. Wasn't aiming that at you or anything. :P\n\nI've just seen that been touted so much it bugs me now since I'm probably one of the few people left who has been around since early 2000ish on gymnastics and bodyweight training.\n\nDang it's been a long time, haha \nsantiagopinzon: Well I sometimes also wonder...there was a moment, maybe after Btgb was released, where so many people gathered around GB...Yuri Marmerstein, Ido Portal, Rob Wolf, I don't know if that also includes you and Jim Barthust... It's just amazing how coach Sommers lost so many opportunities of having created a huge company that could have maybe competed with Crossfit. He just made all of the quality people fly off because of his attitude, accusing them, censoring them, could you imagine a company where Yuri had made Handstand 3, Ido Portal Movement 1, Rob Wolf Thrive nutrition, Jim a Weightlifting companionship program, you could have worked on programming and progressions for Foundation! Or rehabilitation... Everything lost due to a personal attitude.\n\nedit: Kit Laughlin the stretch series..I'm sure I'm missing tons of people with quality work (Handbalancer, Slizzardman, etc) \neshlow: Doubtful. \n\nSommer was the gymnastics person for CF for a little bit before GB forums and BtGB but the big egos of him and Glassman clashed too much.\n\nNothing much has changed since with all of the people passing through like Ido, Robb, and so on. There's only room for Sommer's stuff. No one else. That's why I got banned. That's why most of the names on your list were kicked or banned too. Jim was never on there though.

You want to cut pay to cut costs? Start with your own, it's the biggest part of the wage cost.\nWheream_I: &gt;especially considering their own pay is often substantially more costly than all their employees combined.\n\nUmm what? If you spend literally a single second, just 1, thinking about that statement and doing some incredibly basic math, you\u2019d see that that comment is incredibly not true.\nRandyHoward: Maybe you would like to explain your stance? Because I don't see how it's not true most of the time. I've been an executive in a business, I know first-hand how much executive pay costs a company vs. employee pay. So please, enlighten us as to why you believe that isn't true.\nWheream_I: In 2018, Jim Hackett, CEO of Ford, made $17.75mil in total compensation. \n\nAs of Dec 2018 Ford has 199,000 employees. 17,750,000/199000=$89. So unless every single other employee at Ford is only making $89/yr, no, executive comp doesn\u2019t account for a higher number than lower level comp.\n\nLet\u2019s assume these 199,000 employees work 32 hours per week, on average (some will be at 40, some less, let\u2019s say it averages 32). $7.25x32x52x199,000=2,400,736,000. If every single employee is literally only making minimum wage. 2,400,736,000/17,750,000=135.2. So for this example, Ford would have to pay every single one of its employees national minimum wage, average under 40 hours/week for them, AND pay 135 executives 17.75 mil/yr, for executive compensation and company comp to be in parity. That\u2019s not even \u201chave executive outweigh all other comp\u201d like you said. This is just to be EQUAL.\n\nLike I said, some basic as fuck math.\nRandyHoward: First of all, you're citing a single company. Do you know how many companies exist that are nowhere near as large as Ford? Second of all, you're comparing one single executives pay to all employees. That's not what we're discussing. How much is the total executive pay compared to all employees? Your math is way off base because you're comparing one executive to all employees, which was never my argument.\n\nSure, you're doing some basic as fuck math, but your variables are all wrong.\nice109: Even if I agree with you the person responded did approximate that it would take 135 executives not one\nRandyHoward: And as I said, Ford is a single company. Ford is also full of employees that are unionized. Try running the same math for a company that doesn't have a union sticking up for its employees.\nice109: &gt;Second of all, you're comparing one single executives pay to all employees. That's not what we're discussing. How much is the total executive pay compared to all employees? Your math is way off base because you're comparing one executive to all employees, which was never my argument.\n\nMost of the words in your comment are about \"one executive\". Maybe they edited their comment after you responded but as it stands they do respond to that part of your criticism.\nRandyHoward: &gt; Most of the words in your comment are about \"one executive\"\n\nI never said one executive. Reread the comment, then reread the whole thread and you'll find yet another comment where I show another redditor how to have some damn reading comprehension. You think that because someone provided some math that they're right, and I've even gone on to explain how their math is wrong in other comments. They've also cherry-picked a single company, one that employs hundreds of thousands of people, who are also unionized, which is very much not the norm when you look at all businesses on the whole. I did not state that it is universally true that executive pay is always higher than employee pay, I stated that it was often the case. If someone wants to go cherry-pick a company to refute my argument, well go right ahead, but you're only looking at an example of one of those companies that it isn't true for, primarily for two reasons: 1) They employ hundreds of thousands of people, and 2) Their workforce is unionized.

{"full_text": "dskang: Focusing on mobility over strength for beginners\nFirst, a little background: I got into bodyweight fitness 2.5 months ago and have been consistently training using the [Start Bodyweight](http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/about-start-bodyweight-program.html) progressions. I've been happy with my progress and can now comfortably do basic strength exercises like pistol squats, pull ups, and dips. My goal is to work up to advanced moves like the muscle up, planche, front lever, side lever, and handstands.\n\nOver the past week, I've been looking into the [Gymnastic Bodies](http://www.gymnasticbodies.com/product-category/foundation-series/) Foundation program and was surprised by how much Coach Sommer, the creator of the program, stresses the importance of working on mobility before attempting advanced holds and strength work. Especially in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHSESdnfpOk), he talks a lot about developing mobility and strengthening connective tissue before even attempting the more taxing holds in order to avoid any risk of injury.\n\nMost of the pre-made programs mentioned in this subreddit and in the training guide such as the /r/bodyweightfitness Beginner Routine, Start Bodyweight, Antranik's routine, etc. seem to differ from GB in that they focus mostly on strength and not so much on mobility or conditioning connective tissue. I understand that the Beginner Routine is targeted at beginners and that the given exercises do not require much mobility, but for someone who's looking to eventually accomplish the advanced holds without injury, it seems prudent to start mobility work as soon as possible.\n\nFor the members of this subreddit who have been training a lot longer than I have, what do you think about the importance of starting mobility work as soon as possible? I'm thinking about switching from the Start Bodyweight routine to Gymnastic Bodies in order to build my mobility and would appreciate any advice. Thanks!\nNitrosity: fuck man. After looking into this, its coming down on my resolve to work out hard.. it seems obvious that the stuff the Coach is saying is sensible. \n\nThing is I was looking to start on a bodyweight regime tomorrow. Ive been reading mark lauren's \"you are your own gym\" and i was excited to try out the concepts and workouts that he has listed. \n\nThen i find this that tells me theres no point unless im in good muscular balance, and that i need to build up the strength of my connective tissue and my mobility before i bother. \n\nI have a full time job, running shift patterns, honestly i have no idea what do to now lol\n\nI cant wait 18 months to see results, and thats just foundation 1!!\n\nany advice?\nMrMontage: What's the hurry, are you gonna die soon?\nNitrosity: no, but honestly my incentive atm is that i feel like i am not living these years to their fullest potential. I feel like fixing my body will help me fix other shit in my life, i want to get visible results fast and then build up my strength later if possible.\n\nim also wary of the fact that i have weak wrists, that i cant touch my shins, and that fixing that shit will make life easier later on. Catch 22\n\nFmeson: Visual results are much slower than strength results and it's hard to achieve one without at least a bit of the other. \nNitrosity: hopefully ill see some physical improvement in 10 weeks.. Im by no means a finished product, but ive been a labourer for 4 years (developed a bit of a monkey shoulder from shovelling the samd :/) and before that in my mid teens i boxed, did karate and fencing..\n\nHopefully theres enough of a basis to see some good results with a good diet.\nFmeson: If you are losing weight you can expect to see results decently quickly, but building muscle is always slow. \nNitrosity: Im 6ft2 running about 13 stone. \nFigure ill cut the fat and build muscle simultaenously with a good diet,\nbut i reckon i could do with another stone actually.\nwould a photo help?\n\nFmeson: Hey, I'm really similar stats wise!\n\n You can cut fat and build muscle simultaneously, but it might be the slowest way to improve appearances. The process is called recomping (gain muscle and lose fat while staying at about the same weight) and is in my opinion underrated, but it you see change so slowly that it tends to be discouraging.  The reason is that the fat loss and muscle gain are both a bit slower than if you had focused on one. \n\nTry this out for fun. Imagine you can either gain 1lbs of muscle and lose 1 lbs of fat a month (recomp), gain no muscle but lose 4 lbs of fat (cut), or gain 2 lbs of muscle and 1lbs of fat a month (bulk). Starting at 180lbs and 20% bf, how long will it take you to reach 10% bf? You should find its much quicker to cut than recomp and impossible to do with the set numbers bulking. \n\nInterestingly enough though, cutting then bulking back to 180lbs using those numbers will return the same results as recomping in the same amount of time. The advantage to cutting first is that you lose fat quickly and the advantage to first bulking is that you gain muscle quickly. So its kind of a personal choice. \nNitrosity: I dunno mate. Shits crazy. Tbh I'm not that fat IMO. I'm not overweight hopefully it should just be a bulking transformation with some luck. If I were going to do one at a time id want a bit more time really. I'll let you know how I get on \nFmeson: Good luck! 13 stones isn't a large amount for 6'2\", so I think you'll be happy bulking and get crazy strong. I just don't want you to get the wrong idea and think aesthetics will be quick and easy.\nNitrosity: Cheers man. I hope so.

If this is true, then humans are God.\nSo essentially my argument comes from logic. Taking religion out of the question: Everything comes from something. The universe then would also have a source. For the sake of using vocabulary we are all familiar with, I will call this source 'God'.\n\nSo if nothing existed before the universe but God, then the universe itself must have been created using the energy of God's own being.  For where else could God obtain energy to create the universe if nothing else existed but God?\n\nIf this is true, then all of nature would essentially be \"God energy\", or simply \"God\". This further implies that we as humans are God as well. \n\nLastly, what seemingly supports my argument is figures like Buddha, Christ and so on, who all have come to the truth about the nature of reality and their connection too it - thus giving them \"god like power\". Of course society created institutions around these figure's messages, and religions emerged. But still, the idea that people have achieved such states (including others besides Buddha and Christ) seemingly lends evidence to my claim that we are all God.

The universe is resting on the back of an enormous meta-turtle, floating in the seas of Everlore. \n      2. The universe was created by a somewhat powerful god, but that god is just a middle management God, and he reports to a member only slightly higher the him in the Dei-ocracy. \n       3. The universe is a collection of physical and chemical laws, with no grand creator, and edged by literal nothing, and everything since the last bang in the big-bang cycle, has obeyed the laws we recognize now, and has causally followed from their implementation. \n      I could go on in adfinitum \nChewyman11: All of your responses though do not denote an end point. For instance, 1. what then created the meta-turtle? 2. What is the source of all the God's in the diocracy  (nice word btw lol) 3. What sparked the big bang cycle?\n\n\n\ntaoistchainsaw: Exactly.

{"full_text": "accountt1234: How the race, intelligence, and genetics question will semi-resolve within the next 10 years : Gene Expression\n\nsoypirate: The term \"race\" is a floating signifier. \" Any attempts to ground the concept scientifically have largely been found to be untenable.\" - stewart hall. This could be said about the term \"intelligence\" as well. This article is a cluster of speculative BS.\ncadfe: According to your logic (or Stuart Hall's logic), the term \"species\" would be a floating signifier as well. Yet this term is accepted in science even though the boundaries between species can be just as fuzzy as those between races. Species is accepted because it doesn't offend anyone, that's it.\nsoypirate: In the biological sciences, the term \"species\" is applied to organisms that can interbreed. If you cannot interbreed, you are a different species. That is a fixed signifier.\ncadfe: Nope. Check this out.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species\nThink about it this way. Homo sapiens can breed with a homo sapiens from 100 years ago yes? And that homo sapiens can then breed with another from 100 years more back yes? And we can keep going all the way back to Australopithecus. But of course an Australopithecus could not breed with a human of today. \n\nThe concept of species is just a slippery and fuzzy as that of race. But if we can use the term species as a mental tool to think about organisms with different genetic traits, then so can we the term race.\nsoypirate: Slippery if you add time travel, you rogue.\ncadfe: That's irrelevant and you didn't even read the link. The point is there can be two species with a genetic continuum between them, much like there can be two races with a genetic continuum in between them. Where we draw the line is arbitrary LIKE YOU SAID, but that doesn't mean that the respective concepts don't have validity and usefulness.\nsoypirate: Yes, however one can be grounded SCIENTIFICALLY, whereas the other, race, can only be grounded in a socio-historical perspective. It has SOCIO-HISTORICAL validity, but all attempts to ground it scientifically have largely been found to be untenable. Read some Stewart Hall. Sociobiology is a pseudoscience.\ncadfe: Species is a term for a organism with a certain group of traits, so is race. Other species have races too, but we call them sub-species. Are you going to say that the term \"sub-species\" has no scientific validity?\n\nCheck out the Asian and African lions. They can interbreed. But we call them two different species, not even two different sub-species. What about the Asian and African homo sapiens? Oh yea of course no such distinction exists.\n\nYou have to approach this subject as if you were an alien trying to study this earth. You're making a distinction between humans and other organisms when no such distinction exists. An alien biologist would undoubtedly say that Asians, Whites, and Blacks are 3 different sub-species or 3 different species altogether.\nsoypirate: The biological problem is this: the variation within human groups is greater than the variation between groups. \n\n\u03bb (within groups) &gt; \u03bb (between groups)\n\nAll humans are the same species: Homo sapiens. The groups you're describing? Not by any scientific definition different species. Let me ask you this: what is \"white\"? You may say, well, thats caucasian. The Caucasus was just arbitrarily chosen as the \"best\" example of white in 18thC. There was just some sheep herder there that the British scientist (name escapes me), picked as the \"best\" example. In what way is a Caucasian sheep herder related to a Norwegian Lap? Or a Scot? Well, they're both humans, but their complexion is vastly different, among many other traits. But under your SOCIO-HISTORICAL category, they are both \"white\". Exactly the same as \"black\" (look at pygmies vs. Masaii), and \"asian\" (russia vs. chinese vs. indonesian). That boundary you delimited is not historically fixed, and you would be hard-pressed to apply the label \"sub-species\" let alone \"species\". Much more useful to talk of ethnic groups. But what is it that ties those together? Language? Geography? Religion? What about, for example the Jews? Religion? Ethnicity? Certainly not a \"race\".\n\nBy the way, this \"argument\" you have there? Classic racism, with a whiff of sociobiology/eugenics.\n\nEDIT: for a source, if you dont believe me, here is the first segment of the Wikipedia article on race:\n\n\"Race is a classification system used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by anatomical, cultural, ethnic, genetic, geographical, historical, linguistic, religious, or social affiliation. First used to denote national affiliations, the term began to be used to relate to physical traits in the 17th century and promoted hierarchies favorable to differing ethnic groups. Starting from the 19th century the term was often used, in a taxonomic sense, to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype.\nWhile biologists sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way, i.e. that among humans, race has no taxonomic significance: all living humans belong to the same species, Homo sapiens and subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens.\"\n\nThat is why your argument is unscientific and actually racist.\ncadfe: First of all you're not tearing down my arguments. You're actually agreeing with me. You are trying to say that race is an arbitrary classification and that the boundaries are fuzzy. Exactly what I said. But where you go wrong is that you think race is not valid while species is valid. Nope. There are two positions you can take on this argument.\n\n1. Race and species are not useful because the boundaries between different genetic populations are fuzzy\n2. Race and species are useful semantic tools to help scientists think despite the fact that the boundaries between populations are fuzzy.\n\nYou can't have one and not the other. That would be contradicting yourself.\n\nNowhere did I make any references to any subjects in sociobiology or eugenics. I suspect your background in science is limited. I would recommend you actually take some time to learn evolutionary biology, then come back and debate with me so we can actually have an interesting and intellectually stimulating debate.\n\nOh and Wikipedia is hardly a credible source.\n\n(PS, I can touch on the variation within groups vs between groups issue if you want. It's an interesting point but I believe I can explain it.)\nsoypirate: Except for the fact that species is used by (respected) scientists, while race is not. Race is a socio-historical category, not a scientific one. Thats all. Im not agreeing with you in any way.\ncadfe: Any scientist worth his salt knows these things in private but won't say them in public because they fear backlash from the liberal media and people like you (social scientists don't count). James Watson (yup the DNA guy) tried to say there are inherent differences in the intelligence of races, but he was shamed into apologizing for his statements. Look it up.\n\nI understand your aversion to accepting this fact of life, and I think that we should be careful in how we discuss these things with the public. If we just outright say the facts, then all the idiot stormfront people go 'YEA WHITES ARE THE BEST SCREW BLACKS. But if we deny the facts then the idiot liberals like you go \"YEA THERE ARE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RACES LETS ALL HOLD HANDS AND SING KUMBAYAH\". \n\nI don't like either group because I stand with science, and science is obligated to acknowledge the facts. I know I've won this argument because you've resorted to just restating your opinion without backing it up with an argument. If you are just a regular person, or maybe you have political aspirations, then hold on to your current beliefs because they will serve you well. But if you ever go into any branch of science, you will eventually find the truth behind my words.\nsoypirate: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMo2uiRAf30\n\nThis is a segment of Stewart Hall's lecture on race.\nYou haven't won shit. Science is not about \"know these things in private but won't say it because of liberal backlash\". Science is open and PEER REVIEWED. That means that the info has to be shared with others, not hidden from view. James Watson (im familiar) is a bloody racist, dude. \nAnd so are you. The \"truth behind you words\" is racist bullshit and has been disproven over and over again by mainstream scientists and anthropologists (Fanz Boas, Gould, Dawkins, Jonathan Marks, etc).

I don't want to mess this up because I have few friends who are girls but I definitely would like to be more than friends but I at least want to be friends with this girl. (One long sentence is my version of making a long story short I guess). \n\nSo what should I do? Should I have texted her? (I can't think of anything I would have said beside \"What was your grade on the test?\") Is it too late to text(as previously stated it's been a few days)? Should I wait for the next class to talk to her?(I've pretty much committed to doing this unless ya'll say otherwise) What do I do if for some reason I don't talk to her next class?(I'm really afraid of this happening...help) I'm really bad with social situations and even worse with texting/calling etiquette. Pls halp\n\nEdit: To make it clear that I have limited social skills, she pretty much gave me her number with explicit instructions to call and study sometime, otherwise this would have never happened in a million years. I don't know what to do now and I don't want to mess up creating this friendship.\nDiece: FRIENDS. \n\nSorry man but you are definitely much better off being friends with this girl.

She wanted to study, call you that shows interest. I would say she is interested based on that fact alone BUT she may have moved on and considers you just a friend now.\n\nI would advice just talking to her here and there. Maybe study with her a couple times. If she has a lot of friend you can use her to insert you into a more popular group of kids and go from there. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area I would personally just be friends with her and treat her as one. Use her to meet her friends and go from there.\nSwagSwagSwagYOLOswag: &gt; I would say she is interested based on that fact alone BUT she may have moved on and considers you just a friend now.\n\nCan it really happen that fast. I wasn't really sure she was interested in the first place but you're telling me that even if she was she may have already lost interest?(It's only been a few days...less than a week for sure... I called her, we studied, we texted) If this is the case then I feel like I'm in way over my head because I have no clue what to do.

But I'm totally fine being just friends but I'm not even sure how to accomplish this lesser feat.\nDiece: oh man I mis-read, if its less than a week your fine.

Where? How? In person? On a second study outing(this could be weeks away)? After class? What gets the message across without being blunt? Or is being blunt the way to go? \n\nSorry for the open endedness but it is a bonus question meaning you don't need to answer. \nDiece: alright, what I would do is start flirting with her, joke around with her treat her like she is someone you want to date not someone you want to be friends with. Flirt with her, set up a date and go from there. \nSwagSwagSwagYOLOswag: Ok. What about texting her? I feel as if I should avoid texting her until I (attempt to) speak to her in person again. Am I right or am I wrong about that? So far you've basically reinforced what I was thinking about doing (I was just so damn unsure of it).

{"full_text": "P0werPuppy: YSK that OCD is a real condition, and can get quite severe. Saying \"This really triggers my OCD\" is actually quite silly.\n[removed]\n[deleted]: If a person says that, but do not have what is clinically labelled OCD, they are still referencing a valid feeling they have, and are using words they know in frames of reference they know. Incorrectly maybe, but to them it is a level of compulsion that is valid.\n\nIf one feels that these people are belittling the condition of 'true' sufferers, consider this: by suggesting that someone shouldn't use a term because they do may not have the strictest, truest definition of the condition as you understand it, you may inadvertently deter someone from considering if they may, in fact, suffer from it, or from something similar to it, and not seeking the help they need.\n\nThe truth as I understand it, as I understand it, is that all medical diagnoses and amateur self reflections are highly abstracted ways of describing states and processes of cognition that are not really easily described with words, yet its what we use, and so are always highly inaccurate, if useful.\n[deleted]: What I mean to say is, as long as a registered doctor isn't throwing the term around, I think we can forgive its colloquial misuse.\n\nIf someone says that something is triggering their OCD, I assume that they would like something done differently. And in that respect, it is exactly the information I need regardless of whether it's coming from someone with a confirmed diagnosis or not.\nP0werPuppy: I agree that self diagnosis, as well as visiting the doctor to confirm it is a brilliant way to learn more about yourself, and conditions. I do it a lot. I honestly don't think we can forgive it, once told. Most of them do not have OCD, but are annoyed at, for example, their desk being jumbled up. Or an upside down pencil in a pencil pot. These are completely normal things to do, and sprout from our species need for things to be asthetically pleasing. \n\nWhen people say it (most of the time, current use) they just mean something ticks them off. If however you know they do display OCD-like symptoms, such as ordering pencils for hours, immense stress, many strange daytime routines, then yes, go for it, they might have OCD and should get a check up.\n[deleted]: I didn't make my point correctly. If we can't allow people to fumble their words, clumsily use jargon they've heard, then we might as well not talk at all. Words are abstractions with reference to phenomena that that will never be precise. There is no such thing as OCD, or Bipolar, or Psychopathy and the rest. These are just our current best approximations to complex psychological processes that no doubt in fifty years we will have refined beyond recognition. \n\nIt can't be solely be up to the speaker to always be precise to their meaning, especially if they aren't in the field where the phrase originates. You could expect someone to be have read into the etymology of every word they use. But we can't learn everything. The listener has to do some of the legwork. You know what that person means when they say that triggers my OCD. You can choose to hear \"man, I really need to have my surroundings in a certain way, or I just cannot relax\" or you can choose to hear \"haha, man my OCD is flaring up, I'm so crazy, I should be in a mental asylum.\" for some people, exaggeration is a way of getting people to understand them. I much prefer someone overstate their needs than understate. I find it easier to dial down their intent when I process their request.\nP0werPuppy: You made this point even worse honestly. OCD, bipolarity, and in the extreme of extreme cases psychopathy, are not psychological processes, they are conditions. You are essentially saying we are all psychopaths, just by that wording.\n\nIf it is a medical condition, then they have an objective need to know the meaning, and not throw it around. You don't need to know all words, just don't misuse medical conditions, simple as. The first example is described similarly to OCD, but it is more extreme. The second example seems like you are implying that OCD sufferers belong in an insane asylum. In this case, exaggeration is the single worst thing you can do. I would much prefer they say the truth than overstate. If you are worried about them, tell them. Imagine a class of 20 people all saying the phrase. They probably don't have it. It occurs in around 2% of patients. So that's 1/50. Imagine an office with 50 people in. Only one of them would actually have OCD. Imagine the stress you would be causing them, just by saying that. If they do extreme versions of these, of course, then they should see a doctor.\n[deleted]: I am hearing that you are concerned with the exact use of 'OCD.' we're talking at cross purposes then. I am talking more generally that it is impossible that we, generally, all peoples I mean, could always use words the way we all would like them to be used. And we have to suck it up and shut up, or, more generously and patiently *re-interpret* what people say.\n\nIf someone tells me that 'something is triggering their OCD' , I don't take that to mean they are self diagnosing an actual condition. A condition that references to psychological processes, to clap back thank you very much. I take it to mean as best I understand what they are intending to put across.\n\nBesides, it's so commonplace that OCD is used incorrectly, that I imagine psychologists will revise the nomenclature before long, and they class will ironically then be using it correctly. Literally.\nP0werPuppy: May I remind you that this is a medical condition? Most people that say it are not obsessive and compulsive. We shouldn't reinterpret it in this case. We should tell them so they can learn, and it doesn't happen again.\n[deleted]: Is it tho\nP0werPuppy: YES, IT IS. I don't understand why you are so insistent on it being ok.\n[deleted]: You're not going to believe this. But I've got OCD. Really I do. And it's not the flippant one. It's most pronounced during the depressive phase of bipolar. Now, I don't have an actual diagnosis for OCD, but I do for bipolar. I've been in hospital three times but they were during the manic episodes where the OCD isn't symptomatic at all.\n\nI keep my hair shaved because I will constantly knot it. My fingernails are down to the bone. I cannot complete videogames becuase each save file has to be just so. If you played Breath of the Wild, you'll know of the hero's path feature. I can't even begin to explain how I had to plan my routes so that it looked... I dunno... Proper? I will throw workbooks away at the slightest misstep. I will keep a practise workbook that I then rewrite in the actual workbook. I will drop friends and delete accounts and restart everything again in the hope that I can do it *perfectly*\n\nAnyway, I say all this to prove my sincerity. For the longest time I didn't think this was OCD. Because I thought OCD was where you are overly hygienic or irrationally believe that if you don't do something a certain number of times something bad happens. Those are symptoms, but they're not mine. I don't get that. When I brought all this up with the gp as I have in this post, I was told it was a type of OCD. He isn't a psychologist though so I don't want to claim a professional diagnosis.\n\nIt's just, I guess, my OCD doesn't entail getting frustrated with the improper use of OCD!\nP0werPuppy: This is completely different to my examples, and is actual OCD. So I wonder, why are you fighting someone who is on your side. Really I'd think, like the other sufferers I have met, would be annoyed with the misuse of it. Also, you should have been referred to a mental health professional, so if I were you, I would go.\n[deleted]: Im not fighting you. I'm saying: it's OK for people to misuse words. Because it's impossible to *not* misuse words. If you'll forgive the... Triple negative? I have been referred, I was in hospital three times. Am on lithium and sertraline to deal with it.\n\nBut. I would say. There is no real thing as 'actual OCD'. It no more exists than 'love' exists. It is a poor facsimile, a placeholder word for a rich experience that *does* exist internally. \n\nWhat I detailed in my last post is closer to my lived experience than saying 'I have OCD' so I rarely say 'I have OCD'. But saying that long winded diatribe is also impractical, so for the most part, I don't even mention any of this. When someone says to me 'I have OCD' regardless of what they actually experience, I believe them. It could be that they really like their eggs done a certain way and that's the extent of their 'OCD'. That's fine. That's how they've chosen to define it and I can talk to them on their terms. It could be that if they don't turn the light switch on and off at least 100 times and don't end on an odd number they'll be unfit to go about their day. That requires more help to be sure and is certainly more in line with current medicine. \n\nIf they meet, the one who has 'OCD' about breakfast, and the one who is clinically ill with diagnosed OCD, I'm sure they will argue. But that's ok too. Becuase that is how we learn\nP0werPuppy: It's a placeholder for the huge variety of symptoms. That's why it should not be confused. OCD does exist. Liking your eggs a certain way isn't OCD, it's just a preference related to food.

{"full_text": "BrotisBoughtAHouse: Any Roofing Expertise? Please help.\nGreetings Reddit,\n\nMy girlfriend and I recently bought a home in the Midwest, Missouri to be specific.  It's been great, minus my lack of handy experience, but everyone has to start somewhere. \n\nWe had a lot of rain this week and as a result our ceiling sprung a [leek](http://imgur.com/nCSd0bq).  Today I decided to check it out before calling a professional.  The portion of the [roof](http://imgur.com/0Tc9gUd) that is leaking seems to be some sort of metal that is sealed (or is supposed to be).  It is on a dormer that was likely an addition at some point. The rest of the roof is shingled and looks to be in decent shape. \n\nThe problem appears to be the vents in the roof.  Here is:\n*[Vent 1](http://imgur.com/NaWBtS1)\n*[Vent 2](http://imgur.com/Vt7xqAH)\n\nIt is fairly apparent at this point where the water is coming into the house at. I picked away some of the material around Vent 1 and it looks something like this [underneath](http://imgur.com/RvdOKt0). \n\nIt seems that I need to scrape off as much of the weathered sealant as I can and replace the flashing around the vents.  Then reseal the entire dormer portion of the roof with a better product.  Am I right in this methodology or missing something?\n\nSomebody that has experienced this before: what products work best for sealing this type of roof? What about something like [this](http://flexsealproducts.com/shop/liquid/?gclid=CjwKEAjwpfC5BRCT1sKW2qzwqE0SJABkKFKR8vrBSPm1j268gQ3Ni2tXcIO6EmJD-F04Kx3Dj91bFhoC_vnw_wcB)?\nThe appearance in this location isn't very important, as it can't be seen from the ground.\n\nThanks a bunch!\nsomeonesdaddy: I laugh so hard at everyone in this thread that says call a roofer. I laugh even harder at the top comment that says call the previous homeowner and ask him to help pay for it. \n\nThese roof vents are known frequent culprits for leaking and it is no big deal. Clean the area up and apply a rubberized compound or tar. I have even used the rubberized aerosol spray before thus creating a rubber boot.\n\nI like the rubberized product called stop leak. It comes in a one gallon paint can and you apply/shape it with a putty knife. For a complex shape I will wear rubber gloves and mold it by hand. \n\nYou are a homeowner now and welcome to the big leagues.  You can't call someone everytime your toilet is clogged anymore. Go forth and be the master of your castle.\n\nYour average contractor will scare you into turning a small job into a big one. This is especially true if they think the homeowner is not very mechanically savvy. \nAbsolutelyPink: While I agree that a roofing contractor can scare you into turning a small job into a big one, this roof is in bad shape and flat or semi-flat roofing jobs are best left to a professional.  Spraying rubber isn't going to fix this one. \n\nI have roofing experience, but there are specialty products meant for flat roofs that aren't as simply as spraying rubber on the roof. It need to be redone and not just around the vents.\n\nMake sure you call a couple companies for estimates and make sure they specialize in flat roofs.  You can check with mobile home sellers in your area for referrals as well.\n\nYou will also need to fix that drywall.  Odds are, the insulation (if any) above that is wet as well.  The drywall will need replacing at a minimum.  If it's still wet, poke a couple holes in it to let the water drain.\n\nAs a temporary measure, tarp your roof until you get it repaired.\nsomeonesdaddy: I agree with you and your advice is sound. There have been times in my life when I could not afford the proper solution or the best one.\n\nI have made due with patching stuff like this in the past. In Florida where I live the roofing laws are funny because of hurricanes. If anything more than 25% of the roof is damaged you are required to get a whole new roof. \n\nI have seen plenty of good roofs complete torn off because a small section needed repair. These days homeowners are looking for a roofer  that is not going to pull a permit thus requiring inspection. \nAbsolutelyPink: I agree.  I've been in the position where I couldn't afford to have things done properly and made due with what I could afford.  It sucks.  Unfortunately, a roof is not where you want to pinch pennies. Heck, in Nevada we get winds enough to rip off a roof. This roof will leak and leak again until it's redone.  Let's just hope there hasn't been enough damage already, to cause the ceiling or roof to cave in though mold might already be of issue.\nBrotisBoughtAHouse: Thanks for the feedback.  I think I might be able to handle the flashing parts, but as others have pointed out, there are likely greater underlying problems that I don't want to risk.  It's looking like stop leak is the way to go for now for an immediate solution.  Over the next week I plan to get a slew of estimates on a more thorough fix.

On 12 July there will be a nationwide protest against the hijab.\n\nOk_Fortune_9149: In my country you'll get arrested now if you wear burka, same opression really. Stop telling woman what to or not to wear altogether now shall we?\nGaMa-Binkie: \n\nAre you seriously saying all people not being allowed to wear a Burka, an enveloping outer garment which covers the entire body and the face, is comparable to only women being arrested for showing their hair or the crime of wearing form fitting clothing?\n\n\u201csAmE oPreSsiON\u201d\nEliotisnotconfused: Are you dense????? BOTH tell women what they can wear and not.\n\nIf you tell a woman she cant wear a burka or hijab, even tho she wants to, its literally the exact same oppression as telling a woman who doesnt want to cover up, to cover up.\n\nThe main problem for you is the limiting women thing, right?? Yet why are you then too dumb to see telling women that they can not wear what they want as not being oppression? \n\nThats hypocritical. Youre contrdicting yourself, if you say that one kind of control over women is bad, while the other is good. \n\nBoth limit them, if they want to do the opposite. You idiots going for \"womens rights\" are leaving out the plenty of women who actually want to wear a hijab or burka. \n\nIts THEIR choice. Forcing anybody anything in a liberal country is fucking pathetic, you hypocrite.\nGaMa-Binkie: Lol, let me make this clear for your simple mind.\n\nOne law prohibits **anyone from covering their face**\n\nThe other law enforces specifically **all women to completely cover their hair and dress very conservatively**\n\nThey are not the same at all, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll keep grasping at straws anyway\nEliotisnotconfused: Both laws restrict women who want to dress differently.\n\nYour simple mind thinks its an obvious difference, allthough there pretty much is none.\n\nWhat about women who want to wear a burka?? Youre oppressing these women by restricting them in how THEY want to wear, just like a law that requires burkas would restrict women who wouldnt want to wear one.\n\nBOTH restrict women and tell them what they can and cannot wear. \n\nDont act like youre for womens rights with this, as such laws are restricting countless women who want to wear differently. \n\nEither accept all of these laws, or be against both. Being for one but not the other is very hypocritical, as I have pointed out already.\nGaMa-Binkie: Why aren\u2019t you outraged that men can\u2019t wear a burka and cover their face?\n\n&gt;What about women who want to wear a burka??\n\n*What about women\u2019s male guardians who want to force them to completely cover their entire being including their faces 24/7\n\nFTFY\nEliotisnotconfused: &gt;Why aren\u2019t you outraged that men can\u2019t wear a burka and cover their face?\n\n???????? This isnt our argument. Now youre just redirecting it and changing subject as an argument.\n\n&gt;*What about women\u2019s male guardians who want to force them to completely cover their entire being including their faces 24/7\n\nIf both sides agree, then yeah they can do it. If the woman doesnt agree, then its oppression and restriction and shouldnt be accepted. Just like a woman shouldnt be forced to leave her burka if she doesnt want to. \n\nAnd this was my point the entire time, dumbass. \n\nIf a couple wants that, let them do it.\n\nIf in a liberal country a woman wants to wear a burka, let them do it.\n\nIf somebody doesnt want to wear a burka, let them do it. \n\nForcing anybody should be wrong and its all the same kind of restriction. \n\nYoure against the choice of women wearing what they want, because you want to restrict them and tell them that they cant wear a burka. \n\nTypical. Go away dude, youre a hypocrite  and you have a GIANT double standard. \n\nIf one law is wrong for telling women what to wear against their will, then ALL laws are wrong for telling women what to wear against their will.\nGaMa-Binkie: **Why aren\u2019t you outraged that men can\u2019t wear a burka and cover their face as the law covers all people and not just women?**\nEliotisnotconfused: If a man desperatly wants to in a liberal country then he should be allowed to.\n\nAgain, its about choice you fuck head. \n\nEither choice for ALL or restrictions for ALL.\n\nThe west likes to act like they want choice for ALL, yet surpress the choice of muslim women or other people who want to wear a burka.\nGaMa-Binkie: Keep seething that there are Muslim women who can feel the warmth of the sun on their skin, the breeze flow through their hair and breath fresh air, without fear of persecution.\n\nIf you really cared about women\u2019s rights you wouldn\u2019t be whingeing about all people not being allowed cover their face in one country and would be talking about\n\n[All the Islamic countries have it legal for men to rape their wives due to the Quran specifically leaving wives out of the definitionof rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_laws_by_country)\n&gt; \"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\".\n\n[And all the Islamic countries where a woman's word only counts for a half of a mans in court.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_women%27s_testimony_in_Islam)\n\nBut we both know the truth is that you don't care about women's rights and just want to justify your shitty sexist views\nEliotisnotconfused: Strawman arguments....\n\nAlso, the Quran verses have specific meanings. Go to any Islamic scholars and they will tell you that you dont know Islam or the Quran.\n\n\nYoure so pathetic man. Such dumb arguments, I feel like I shouldnt even call you out for how dumb they are.\n\nAnd if you dont believe me, then PLEASE go to any source beyond Wikipedia. Maybe use your brain about choice.\n\n\n\nLiteral hypocrite. Never thought I would see one in the wild. \n\n&gt;Keep seething that there are Muslim women who can feel the warmth of the sun on their skin, the breeze flow through their hair and breath fresh air, without fear of persecution.\n\nHAHAHAHHAHAHAH \"Hmmm I must forbid women from wearing a burka, because WHAT IF THEY FEEL TOO WARM???\". Thats sexist. VERY sexist. Youre acting like women cant make their own choices and need men like you to tell them if wearing a burka is good for them or not. \n\nMany women want to wear a burka. By restricting them, youre oppressing them. \n\nYoure a sexist hypocrite with a double standard, who is unable to make proper research on an argument, nor is able to use his brain. Sucks to be you....\n\nJust go man...youre beyond embarrassing. And people like YOU are trying to make a better future for women? Just admit you dont like seeing women wanting to follow Islam. Thats all thats wrong with you.\nGaMa-Binkie: &gt; Strawman arguments....\n\nYou clearly don't know what a strawman is\n\nWhy are you handwaving Islam's definition of rape and it's detrimental effects on women, you know, those people whose rights you definitely support. The definition is not up for debate or interpretation, it is clear and concise.\n\n\"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\".\n\n31 Muslim countries have marital rape legalized due to this definition, yet you do not care for obvious reasons\n\n1.

United Arab Emirates\n29. Yemen\n30. Iraq\n31. Maldives\n\nYou also seem to be in denial about Islam specifically stating that a woman's word is worth half a mans\n&gt; O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down. Let a scribe write it down in justice between you. Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so let him write. Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must fear Allah, his Lord, and diminish not anything of what he owes. But if the debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is unable himself to dictate, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her.\nEliotisnotconfused: Rape is a major sin in Islam and can get you terrible punishments in Sharia Law, you ignorant. You can literally google it, as thats what the Sunnah says. And Islam also says that before intercourse, both sides have to agree to do so. \n\nTHIS SHOWS HOW MUCH OF AN IGNORANT YOU ARE, IF YOU CANT EVEN GOOGLE YOUR CLAIMS.\n\nJust go already man. Youre making a fool out of yourself, you sexist. \n\nYou think you have to \"protect\" women and their rights by taking their choice of wearing a burka. You think they cant make their own responsible choices? If a woman wants to wear a burka, let her wear it.\nGaMa-Binkie: It's clear that you haven't actually read the Quran. Rape of your wife is not rape under Sharia (It's just Sharia BTW and not \"Sharia Law\") as the definition of rape in the Quran specifically leaves out women who are victims of their husbands.\n\n\"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman **who is not legally married to him**, without her free will and consent\"\n\nWhich is why most Islamic countries have Marital rape legalized\nEliotisnotconfused: IM MUSLIM so of course I read it AND have read many scholars opinions on it, while your source is just Wikipedia. \n\n&gt;It's just Sharia BTW and not \"Sharia Law\"\n\nBoth terms are right.

Just research. \n\nHow come I managed to find something in under 10 seconds that disproves your point, while you cant even research anything?\nGaMa-Binkie: &gt; https://www.abuaminaelias.com/dailyhadithonline/2012/09/02/prophet-punishes-rapist/\n&gt; \n&gt; YOU COULD HAVE JUST GOOGLED!!!!!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Heres a LITERAL hadith about when the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) punished a man who raped a woman.\n\nWhat you just showed is not relating to **Marital rape**, you have yet again exposed your ignorance of the Quran. Under Islam's definition it is not possible to rape your wife\n\n&gt; \"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman **who is not legally married to him**, without her free will and consent\".\n\nThank you for continuing to grasp at straws like I asked you to\nEliotisnotconfused: Just google. Intercourse is only allowed if both agree. \n\nYou can simply google.\nGaMa-Binkie: Under Islam's definition which is the definition most Islamic countries follow, Rape is only when\n\n\"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\".\nEliotisnotconfused: That doesnt change the fact that intercourse can only happen when both agree. \n\nIt isnt called \"rape\" after the defintion that you mentioned, but it still isnt allowed, the way you act like you do.\nGaMa-Binkie: Link to the exact quote you\u2019re referencing or stop spreading false information.\n\nThe definition is clear in its meaning\n&gt;\"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\".\nEliotisnotconfused: Its still unlawful to force your wife to sleep with you. \n\nIt may not be called \"rape\", but its still not allowed.\n\nhttps://www.abuaminaelias.com/consent-marriage-concubines/\n\nTo quote:\n\n\"Consent in lawful sexual relations (that is, a valid marriage) is an important moral consideration in Islam. After all, marriage should be based upon love and mercy, as stated in the Quran, and part of a healthy sexual relationship is the mutual pleasure experienced by both parties. Any form of sexual violence has been and always will be unlawful in Islam. [...]\n\n[...] Since mutual pleasure is one of the acknowledged purposes of lawful sex, it naturally cannot be attained by force, compulsion, or violence.\"\n\nThis opinion has been held by scholars since the early days. Its from people who studied Islam and who know Islam better then we do combined.\n\nHere. Its unlawful to do that. \n\nIt doesnt need to be called rape to be unlawful. Just shows your ignorance.\n\nAlso, you cannot learn Islam from just a few articles, which is why you have such a wrong and misinformed view that is so easy to call out.\nGaMa-Binkie: So you don't actually site anything from the Quran that would specifically go against the definition \n&gt; \"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse **by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him**, without her free will and consent\".\n\nIf they thought raping your wife was wrong why would they specifically say \"who is not legally married to him\" why not leave this part out?\n\nThe intention is clear and 31 Islamic countries following this definition just confirms it\nEliotisnotconfused: Dear Lord are you stupid?\n\nJust because it isnt called \"rape\" doesnt mean that ITS ALLOWED. \n\nThis site is from scholars. They know Islam more then you do. They also got their opinion FROM the Quran, because the Quran says that marriage is for love and that pleasure should be for both. \n\nIf a man rapes his wife, was there pleasure for both? No. Therefore, its not allowed.\n\nYou dont get Islam and arent ready for an Islamic discussion even at its lowest level.\nGaMa-Binkie: Lol, the cognitive dissonance is palpable.\n\nIf they think it's wrong, why did they specifically leave it out of the definition, thus making it legal.\nEliotisnotconfused: Youre stupid. Borderline stupid....\n\nYou simply dont understand Islam. \n\nRape is different back then then it was today. Marriage is different in Islam then it is to you Westerners. \n\nMarriage by itself is some form of \"consent\", as its a very important bond between a man and a woman and they only marry under important conditions, unlike in the West, were marriage isnt like that, but as I said Marriage still has its rules and conditions. \n\nOne of these conditions is that pleasure has be for both. So while its technically not seen as \"rape\" its still is not allowed and will be punished if violent sex acts are forced upon a partner, as it will not lead to pleasure and love for both. \n\nAlso, theres a hadith that says that the best men are those who are kind to their wives. \n\nSo how can a man that forces his wife for sex be lawful in Islam, as it goes against the rules for men and against the conditions for marriage????\n\nThink and use your brain. Before you reply, think about it for 20 minutes very clearly and open mindedly. Hopefully then you will understand why youre wrong.\nGaMa-Binkie: Lol, saying men who are kind to their wives are the coolest isn\u2019t justification for having marital rape legalised.\n\nThe definition specifically allows for it, there is no argument to be had\nEliotisnotconfused: Thanks for admitting that you do not understand Islam, even after its explained to you. \n\nDo not argue about Islam, as youre the most ignorant person Ive ever seen. \n\nIve shown proof, I shown that forced sex is against the conditions of marriage, but you still say its allowed.\n\nOne more time:\n\nIts not definded as the WORD \"Rape\". ITS JUST NOT CALLED THE WORD RAPE.  But it STILL ISNT ALLOWED. \n\nIf you deny this, then youre one of the dumbest, most ignorant and idiotic people that exist. \n\nJust because its not in the definition of rape doesnt mean its allowed. HOW HARD IS IT TO UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU MORON?\nGaMa-Binkie: Not including marital rape under the definition of rape shows that they don\u2019t hold it in that regard. \n\nMost Islamic countries following this definition and having marital rape legalised and go unpunished further confirms it.\n\nYou are trying to justify the un-justifiable, which you\u2019ve proven is impossible with your weak, incoherent and inconsistent arguments\nEliotisnotconfused: Its not rape, but it still is forbidden. How hard is it to understand? \n\nI even explained why its forbidden.\nGaMa-Binkie: Think for a second, why would it be explicitly excluded from the definition of it was Haram\nEliotisnotconfused: Are you fucking braindead?\n\nIts excluded from the definition because its not rape in Islam.\n\nBut that doesnt make it allowed. Sins can be not rape, but still be forbidden. \n\nIt doesnt need to be rape to not be allowed. Why do you think this?\n\nAnd I already explained WHY its forbidden multiple times, as it goes against the conditions marriage. \n\nTheres no argument to be had. Its not rape, but still forbidden as it goes against the conditions of marriage and sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. \n\nUse your brain. I explained it enough times now, you idiot.\nGaMa-Binkie: Why go to the effort of excluding it from the definition of rape if it\u2019s forbidden anyway?\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s Hala to sexually assault your wife \ud83e\udd14\nEliotisnotconfused: Its not rape. \n\nBut its still forbidden. \n\nTwo things can be true at once. \n\nAnd I told you WHY it was forbidden already.\nGaMa-Binkie: Nope, under Islam marriage counts as forever consent so there\u2019s no punishment for raping your wife\n\nIslam and most of its followers approve of this definition\nEliotisnotconfused: The article I showed disproves that. Read it, as it explains that very well.\n\nMarriage has rules. Forcing your wife is against that, as it doesnt mean pleasure for both and marriage is kindness and love towards each other. Violence has no place in that. \n\nAnd no, most of muslims do not approve. Im muslim and have touch to the muslim community aswell as knowledge about it. I can guarantee that most do not agree.\n\nIm proving something. Explaining something. \n\nI literally explained why its forbidden.

This is not an 'other' possible avenue... it is going directly through the Kantian determination of duty\nZombiescout: &gt;which by the way Kant has defined duty means than less than perfect adherence to duty is condoned by duty itself\n\nNo because duty creates a necessity so strict adherence to duty is a moral imperative and thus a must. \n\n&gt;but I think if you are speaking in a primarily English forum you should probably give English quotes\n\nKant is cited in German in academic works for a reason. Without being able to read it in the original you are likely to not be getting it fully. Yes that sounds condescending but it is how Kant studies works.\n\n&gt;This is not an 'other' possible avenue... it is going directly through the Kantian determination of duty\n\nDuty is not determined, duty is discovered and/or experienced/felt. The other possibility is to act \"naturally\" that is in a fully determined non-free way which is whenever we act against the moral law. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nballoo_loves_you: Yeah on some level it still seems somehow problematic but I will refrain from restating myself over and over. \n\nHowever I was thinking about what makes something problematic in this system and I think maybe according to K it would be impossible to will violation of duty by the same will which is attempting to adhere to duty. So while (possibly) not problematic in that it is not impossible to concieve my formulation involves a self-contradicting will I think. I'm trying to write this as it comes to me so it might not be super clear but I thought at least that I would try to get some thoughts on it\nZombiescout: &gt;it would be impossible to will violation of duty\n\nAn act that violates duty is not a free willing but is *willk\u00fcrlich*. If it does not accord with the moral law then it is not an act of free will. This seems like a lame cop out but is pretty much how Kant works all of this out freedom is only possible when one is free of the natural, determined world and that is only so under the moral law.\n\nballoo_loves_you: I'm beginning to think that I should go find a German version of the text. However I am currently almost done with a paper (in which I refrained from trying to use this point, because it was a pretty speculative and soft point I dreamed up while avoiding doing actual work on my paper) and I don't want to complicate the process any more... I hate writing on Kant because a lot of it seems to me to be based on a lot of problematic assumptions (as far as his ethics goes) Thanks for the help anyway.\nZombiescout: Good luck, I agree that writing about Kant is a pain though I think if you have read most of his works the whole system becomes a lot clearer.

My budget is around $5000, and I figure I can get a bench-top mill, lathe, and basic tooling set with that. I can't get anything larger, since anything I use must be carried down a narrow basement staircase and around a tight corner.  No full sized anything.\n\n\nI was looking at the Smithy line of products, but rumblings on the web say that they are no longer made in the USA and the quality has waned. They make a big deal out of their 3-in-1 products, but every single opinion I've heard about the whole design concept is that it is inferior to a standalone mill and lathe.\n\n\nIndustrial Hobbies seems to have a good mill, but they don't publish prices and the website seems to lay on the hype a bit thick. Don't know what to think about that.\n\n\nAround '06 everyone was into the Sieg X3. Is it still awesome?

I can't shell out for any of the high-end software that will generate toolpaths for me, so it's pretty much G-code or whatever is free.  I'm judging that the ability to make crazy repeatable shapes isn't worth the computer maintenance and being married to a CAD system.\n\n\nAny opinions? Thoughts? The intended use is for my own robotics projects, so there will be a lot of aluminum, and some steel.\n[deleted]: I can't tell you much about machines today. My last experience was in my dad's jobbing shop as a lathe hand and screw machine operator with some setup experience when school was out for the summers that was almost 50 years ago when I started.\n\nBut every machine my dad bought would sit until he tuned it. He would rework everything on a machine until he was satisfied, and that included high end stuff like Bridgeport Mills and so on (although I suspect at least part of that was to get him out of the office). You can probably expect to have to do that with any of the tools that you buy at the price level you are talking about.\n\nI have faceted gems, and spent $3,000 on a faceting machine. The machining was more than disappointing. There were burrs, runout, and all sorts of problems on a device that needed to be good to better than a thousandth of an inch. OTOH I also like woodworking, and I have a Oneway lathe that went for about $6K that was far more accurate than I ever would have needed. All I had to do was wire up a 240 circuit, and off I went.\neubarch: I think one of the big contributing factors to the performance of these machines is raw mass (which translates into rigidity).  Unfortunately, that's the one thing I cannot actually have until I get around to pouring a new slab outside my house and erecting a proper detached shop space.  \n[deleted]: Vibration is a major issue. The other two important ones that you will need to deal with are runout, backlash and the ways. Fixing them will solve most of your problems. There are are a lot of places on the web which will help you  on how to deal with these problems. Probably even forums on the particular machine that you buy.\n\nI have a cheap drill press that has a fair amount of runout, and I found out how to regrind the Morse taper (male and female) on the web a long time ago. The web is much bigger, and more informative now. \n\nIt all depends on what kind of work you want to do, and what kind of accuracy that you need.

{"full_text": "figa_53: Opinions on calisthenics + running routine\nHi everyone! \n\nI'm a very busy person (10+ hours of work a day, 2 kids, living far from my hometown) and i'm trying to stick to a routine that is sustainable and that provide me some hypertrophy in the long run.\nSince i'm a military, I need to run at least 3 times a week just to maintain my conditioning for the army fitness requirements of my country (which, for running, means being able to run 1,8 mile/2900 meter in 12 minutes). \n\nMy stats today:\nHeight: 1,72 m / 5,64 feet\nActual weight: 72 kg / 158 lbs\nAge: 29\n\n\nMy fitness/gym experience:\n- Sedentary kid. \n- Joined a gym when was 16 years. At that time, weight went from 58 kg to 62 kg. Flexed arm 32cm. \n- Joined the Military Academy at 17. Quit gym for obvious reasons. For the following 5 years of my life, just survived the Academy (lots of running, calisthenics, field exercises, poor sleep, etc). At the end, my stats were something like: 66kg, flexed arm 33cm, age 21 (year was 2013). \n- For the next 6 years, just maintained the military fitness routine (some running... some calisthenics). Normal diet (3 meals a day, mostly healthy food, some beer at weekends). In october 2019, my stats were almost the same of the previous: 65kg, flexed arm 32cm, age 27.\n- In november 2019, decided to try something to bulk up. Stopped running and begun Starting Strength routine. Diet was normal added with a \"half GOMAD\". Maintained this for 2 months. The results were: Squat went from 40kg to 110kg; bench press went from 50kg to 72kg; overhead press from 16kg to 42kg; deadlift from 50kg to 120kg. Stats at the end: 75kg, flexed arm 35 cm, age 28. HOWEVER, the bad side was: run conditioning went to shit, and the parts of my body that grow the most were my legs, butt and belly! Didnt enjoy my appearence at the end, so I stopped Starting Strength in february 2020.\n- Did nothing (no running, no weights, no calisthenics) from feb to july 2020, because of the pandemic 1st wave. Stats at the end: 67 kg, flexed arm 33cm, age 28.\n- In august 2020, decided to try to bulk up again. This time, with a totally diferent approach: I did the 6 days a week Schwarzenegger Beginner routine. Took creatine and tracked my calories. Didnt run during this time. It *did* work! I was able to maintain that routine till the end of october 2020. Stats at the end: 74kg, flexed arm 38cm. Bad sides: the workouts took too much time (between 1h30 to 2h). For a busy person like me, wasnt sustainable in the long run. Other than that, i wasnt able to run during that time, for 2 reasons: lack of time and lack of energy. \n- From october 2020 to actual days, I did some eventual running and calisthenics. Stats today: 72kg, flexed arm 37cm, age 29. \n\nSo, now I want to try to do something that:\n- Allow me to run the mininum needed to maintain the army fitness requirement (which i think means running at least 3 times a week). \n- Dont take a lot of time. 30 minutes should be the best, but 45 can do.\n- Allow me to get some hypertrophy in the long run.\n- Dont need a gym (gym means time lost going to and from the gym). \n\nAfter some reading (recommended routine reddit, bodyweight muscle book, greyskull lp book, the prio system, etc) I came to the following routine: \n\n1ST WEEK:\nMonday:\n- Chin Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- Push Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- BW squat progression 3x(6-30) \n\nTuesday:\nRunning (5-8 km / pace: 4:45min/km) \n\nWednesday:\n- Front Lever row progression 3x(6-30)\n- Pike Push Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- Hinge progression 3x(6-30) \n\nThursday:\n- HIIT run = (8-12)x400m, 1:30/lap, 1:30/rest \n\nFriday\n- Chin Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- Push Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- BW squat progression 3x(6-30) \n\nSaturday:\n- Running (5-8 km / pace: 4:45min/km) \n\nSunday:\n- Rest \n\n2ND WEEK:\n- Keep the running routine. \n- Alternate the calisthenics workouts. \n\nSome detail:\n- Rest between sets is 2 minutes. \n- After building enough strength and coordination, the idea is going from pike to handstand push ups. \n- I took the rep range from The Prio System book. The author says, at some point, that there are scientific data showing this rep range (6-30) works for hypertrophy. \n- Yes, the strenght routine is like a calisthenic version of Phraks Greyskull LP. \n\nSo, what do you think about this workout? Can I expect some muscle gain in the long run?\nkickflip10_: Two thoughts on this.\n\n6-30 is an enormous rep range. It's not the hypertrophy range. The hypertrophy range is individual to you and is likely to be most prominent with a couple of reps of somewhere in the 6-30 range. For example, one person might see gains around the 6 rep mark. Someone else might see more gains around 10, someone else at 12, 15, 20, so on. You're not necessarily rewarded all the way up to 30 reps. You're just flogging a dead horse. Find the hypertrophy range that works for you and when you can own/ surpass it, decide if you want to build up some muscular endurance and go a bit higher, or add resistance and build back up to the rep range that works for you.\n\nYour running requirement is 2.9km in 12 minutes, so why are you running 5-8km? Unless you specifically want to get better at middle distance running, focus on your 12 minutes. Your HIIT run is a good example. If I was training for 2.9km in 12 minutes, I'd go for 1:1 intervals in the 4-800m range, MAS training, and 12-15 minute 'runs' for comfort/ conditioning. (I also have a military background but different requirements).\nfiga_53: About the running training: I'm just following the Army \"recommended\" running training. Here are screens taken directly from Army Physical Training Field Manual:\n\n- HIIT running training:\nhttps://imgur.com/KEiEy46\n\n- Continuous running training:\nhttps://imgur.com/Qb3LE7e\nhttps://imgur.com/UqhKhNA\nfiga_53: It's in portuguese, but i think it's understandable...\nkickflip10_: Not saying it's wrong, just saying it's not the most efficient way to train for that assessment. If you enjoy running those distances then go for it.\nfiga_53: The problem is that i dont really like running that much, because the more i run, the more i lose time, energy and recovery. I'm doing that protocol just because its the army's recommendation. But I really would like to stick to a running routine that took less time/energy and that provide the minimum conditioning my job need.\nkickflip10_: Easiest I can recommend is 4-6 sets of 1:1, whatever distance makes up roughly what you need. If you need 2.9km, go for 4 x 700, 5 x 600, maybe 5/6 x 500. And just once-twice a week. I think that will help your assessment more than running 5km.\nfiga_53: How much time per lap? If I keep the pace of the army hiit training, a 600m lap should be done in something like 2:15.\nkickflip10_: Aim for a time that is as fast as sustainable for all laps. If 'race pace' is 2:15, but you're resting 1:1, then obviously you can go faster. Try 2:00 and see if you can maintain 5 x 600 @ 2:00 1:1. Adjust a few seconds either way if it's too hard or too easy. Once you find a time that works, don't change it every week. Lock it in for a few weeks, and then change the workout to a different distance (longer or shorter) and repeat the process.\n", "prompt": "figa_53: Opinions on calisthenics + running routine\nHi everyone! \n\nI'm a very busy person (10+ hours of work a day, 2 kids, living far from my hometown) and i'm trying to stick to a routine that is sustainable and that provide me some hypert", "orig": "rophy in the long run.\nSince i'm a military, I need to run at least 3 times a week just to maintain my conditioning for the army fitness requirements of my country (which, for running, means being able to run 1,8 mile/2900 meter in 12 minutes). \n\nMy stats", "generated": "figa_53: Opinions on calisthenics + running routine\n\nHi everyone!\n\nI'm a very busy person (10+ hours of work a day, 2 kids, living far from my hometown) and I'm trying to stick to a routine that is sustainable and provides me some hypertrophy and"}

Maybe because (at least in the shooters I played) there were dedicated player owned servers, and people would frequent specific servers, and build a pseudo-community. \n\nNowadays it's rare for a game to have player ran servers, and match-making always puts you on to teams of strangers, where any perceived lack of skill is lambasted, feeding this need to be \"excellent.\" Gone is the sense of community.\nasinine_qualities: With respect, I wonder whether online gaming can be classified as a hobby? \n\nAren\u2019t hobbies generally solitary pursuits in which the hobbyist makes/does something with a physical outcome eg, woodworking, beekeeping, quilting, bonsai etc. \n\nThe essence of a hobby is that you do it for its own sake, pitting yourself against no-one, so it\u2019s almost impossible to get competitive. I feel gaming falls outside this category and more into sports or entertainment.\nBonzoTheBoss: With equal respect, I disagree with your definition of \"hobby.\" To me, at least, it is simply anything done during your leisure time for entertainment. That does certainly include the more \"hands on\" hobbies that you describe, but I do not think that it needs to have a physical outcome in order to be considered a hobby.\n\nFor example, I would classify reading as a hobby, but that has no \"physical\" outcome, rather just the satisfaction of a completed book.\n\nI also wouldn't say that a hobby needs to be a solitary pursuit. Why just recently I attended a beekeepers society event, where amateur beekeepers from around the county gathered to show off their wares and have them judged. All in good spirit, of course, but there was definitely a sense of friendly competition.\n\nSo, with all that in mind I wouldn't say that gaming was any less of a hobby than reading when it comes to physical outcomes, and no less a hobby for playing with others than beekeeping. There are, of course, those who choose to play single-player games exclusively, and those who never attend a beekeeping event but I would not say that their individual activities are any \"more\" (or less) of a hobby that those who interact with others.\n\nMy point, to reiterate, was more that whereas previously I might hop on for a few friendly rounds and have fun regardless of my performance the friendly competition and winning were secondary to the enjoyment of the match. Obviously I prefer to win but if I had fun it didn't really matter if I lost. These days it seems like the only reason people seem to play is to win, and any lack of performance (real or perceived) is ridiculed and insulted in most toxic fashions.\nasinine_qualities: &gt; simply anything done during your leisure time for entertainment\n\nI would expand this a bit. A hobby should also involve a fair amount of trial-and-error, learning, failing, figuring stuff out, getting better and mastery. I don\u2019t believe a hobby is limited to entertainment, because then it becomes a product that\u2019s passively enjoyed, like a book, it\u2019s readymade with the purpose of entertaining the reader.

{"full_text": "dariargos: How can I deal with my post-injury weakness ? And how usefull is the pinky in grip strength ?\nHey reddit !\n\nIn december, I've had an accident that cost me half of my pinky and injured my fourth finger flexor on my right hand. I didn't workout for two month. I had physical therapy to regain all my range of motion on my fourth finger but it's still pretty stiff.\n\nSince march now I'm slowy coming back at it, but without my pull up bar or my rings, since I'm quarantined without them. I have some suspension band to practice my rows and I was quite hopefull to be able to do some pull ups when I'll have a pull up bar again. Back then I was started to feel good about my fitness level, I could do sets of 10 pull-ups on my good days.\n\nYesterday, I stumbled accross a fitness park that wasn't closed and I tried to do some pull-ups... It was a huge fail, I did two but my fourth finger was killing me, and the scar of the amputation from my pinky were right on top of the bar so it was very unconfortable. After that even passive hangs seemed to much for me, I felt my left hand was supporting most of my weight. I felt so weak and so powerless because of my injury. And also a lot of guilt because I haven't been serious about my grip training. I guess I was in denial about the consequences of my injury on my fitness level, how serious my injury was and how permanently damaged my hand is. \n\nI now feel overwhelmed by the progress I'll have to do again to come back to normal - if that's even possible.\n\nSo I'm coming here whoring some support and encouragements. And also advices : for the some of you who went through injuries, how did you manage being brought so far backward in your fitness level ? If the injury was permanent, how did you manage accepting being limited by your own body ?\n\nPlus another question : how important is the pinky in grip strengh ? I now lack a phalanx and I can't flex the second one. I'm wondering how that would limit / affect me in the longterm.\n\nThanks everyone in advance for your answers and support and thanks in general for being an awesome source of fitness inspiration and motivation !\nmunkie15: It will take time to build up the grip in your injured hand. It sounds like there was a lot of trauma to that area. Tendons and things take a long time to fully heal. Just keep working the grip in your injured hand. Think about adjusting how you grip as well. Maybe a hook type grip will work better than the bar type grip?\n\nAlso, the pinky provides relatively little in grip strength, more for stability.\ndariargos: yup, there was a lot of trauma. My middle finger was injured too but I was lucky the damage was superficial.\n\nOne aspect that difficult for me was that I didn't felt that my fourth finger tendon was that damaged : for the pinky it was obvious, I couldn't move it anymore but I could still move my fourth finger fine. So when the surgeon told me they had to open up the finger to stitch back the tendon I didn't understand. Now that the wound has healed up, I guess that one part of me thought that the tendon was okay too...\n\nThe hook grip seems very interesting ! I'll give it a go when I have a bar to train on again.

I also found Nizoral (and I had the stronger Derm version) was extremely drying for my scalp and didn't really help.\n\nI do use all products but not like every day. I wash maybe every 3 days (and sometimes I just use Conditioner if my hair still feels clean/dry). I spray the toner after showering (helps balance skin pH after using \"soap\"). The scrub was really more for dealing with flaking/dry scalp (prob did it once a month).

{"full_text": "pattysmife: How not to warm up.\nMy apologies if this was linked before, but I thought this was a good article from T-nation that made some very good points.\n\nhttp://www.t-nation.com/article/most_recent/how_not_to_warm_up\n\nSpecifically, the article questions not only the safety but the \"effectiveness\" of the superman hold and many of its variations.  Many spinal twists are also criticized.  If anyone has read the book that the article cites [Facts and Fallacies of Fitness by Mel Siff](http://www.amazon.com/Facts-and-Fallacies-of-Fitness/dp/B00065X0RO), not exactly a big seller, I'd be curious to know more!\n\n\nGoGoGoemon: *Facts and Fallacies* is a fun read, although quite ooold by now! ;) Generally if Mel Siff wrote it, read it! However, although there's still a whole lot of wisdom to be found in *Facts and Fallacies*, it's written in a time when aerobic classes still were THE thing. So, you might be better advised to invest into *Supertraining*, which is still kind of a gold standard, but this one too sadly isn't getting updated anymore.. \n\nGenerally the literature (e.g. good ol' Shirley Sahrmann) cited in that article, which itself isn't that recent, is getting slowly old and maybe even somewhat outdated.\n\nYou've tapped into a huge problem of what rehab literature says is safe movement and what is actually being trained at many places. The stuff on this sub is for the greater part still pretty much on the safer side (to my limited knowledge), if you ignore the shitty \"ab routines\" people come up with, and luckily often get booed off for. \n\nHowever, arch holds/supermans are an utter shit exercise for your back according to Stu McGill. He has EMG research done on them and other back exercises, showing that arch holds create the highest compressive forces on the spine of all back exercises tested, hyperextensions rank, not even close, at a second (still also qualify as a shitty exercise according to McGill). Consequently he says they should better be discarded off just like s(h)it-ups and crunches. But then, maybe it's at least questionable if 3x a week of 60s in that position will actually wreck your spine?? I'm also not completely sure what form they were performed in. I'm pretty sure that you'd get quite different readings doing them with a heavy lumbar arch and hyperextended neck cramping like stupid and recruiting all the force from the low back, or extending from the glutes and thoracic spine with a \"packed\" neck. \"EMG doesn't lie, but doesn't tell the whole truth either\" as Charlie Weingroff likes to say (anyone else seeing the resemblance to Bubbles, btw?).\n\nBut it gets much more complicated if you take a look at what's being taught at gymnasticsbodies for example (/r/flexibility too taps deeper into that confusion, btw). Just off the top of my head, arch body holds/rocks, hyperextensions, circular twisting hyperextensions (both done with a hyperextended neck too), up to full bodyweight Jefferson curls, straddle and v-ups probably too, heavy weighted shoulder dislocations (ironically the potential injury is right there in the name of the exercise, food for thought maybe?) - I've seen all of this mentioned by credible researchers as exact mechanisms of serious injury. Compared to that the stuff in the article seems quite harmless.\n\nSo, now what? I don't know, I'm not a professional and I don't have an answer. I think it's worth mentioning though that gymnastics hasn't exactly a great track record if it comes to wrecked shoulders and backs in particular, but they also do a lot of the above movement patterns very explosively leading to high impact forces on the joints. There's certainly a difference to the static stuff what most of us here do. On the other side, I think it's also worth taking into account that many of those researchers work as health care providers, they don't necessarily get to see too many healthy joints, also there are surprisingly many who don't train in any meaningful degree. This, too, matters somewhat, I think.\n\nI do this \"recreationally\", so my personal approach with potentially riskier skills is that I ask myself if I really need or want to learn them, if it's worth taking a risk. If yes, I try to do it smartly or more precisely what I *think* is smartly. I try to keep intensity, frequency and load low, so that my body hopefully has enough time to recover from any potential wear and tear in between sessions. The majority of my training then is done in \"safe\" positions, neutral spine, packed neck, packed shoulders etc.   \npattysmife: Time to Reddit creep this guy for other posts of high quality.\nGoGoGoemon: Haha, thanks!

Hell, this doesn't even target *all* philosophy grants- just two.\n\nAnd to be fair, at least one of the projects is pretty political to receive public funding.  \n\n\"Focusing on Hegel and Heidegger, this project will \noffer a richer account of the \u201cI\u201d than we currently \nhave access to; one that avoids individualism and \nallows the development of the concept of the self as \nmore of a collective process\" (I'm shocked, shocked I tell you)\n\nhttp://www.uws.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/404726/311012_TheQuestForTheI_Bubbio.pdf\n\nThe second one is almost half a million dollars for studying Hegel's idea of god.  At a time when all countries are facing serious cut backs, these are not bad places to start trimming the fat. \n\nhttp://researchdata.ands.org.au/the-god-of-hegels-post-kantian-idealism\njollyn: I think that Stokes's worry is as follows. Politicians are *starting* from the idea that (at least quite a lot of) philosophy is useless - or is perceived by the public as useless - and *inferring* that funding for (at least quite a lot of) philosophy should be cut.\n\nNow, one might be sympathetic to that view (that conclusion or argument), so long as the qualification - 'at least quite a lot of' - is insisted upon. But I think that Stokes's more particular worry is as follows. The decision about which philosophy is useless, is being taken by people (politicians and electorates) who are crudely materialistic and philosophically naive and hence actually tend towards the view that pretty much all philosophy is useless and so should not be funded. So the worry - call it (if this isn't to poison the well) 'the philistine scenario' is (1) funding decisions will be taken badly because the wrong people are taking them, (2) that here we have a slippery slope.\n\nOne might reply that the alternative - giving the funding decisions to experts in the field - overlooks the possibility that such people can form a self-serving cabal. That is true; they can. But that doesn't make the philistine alternative any more appealing. We need a way of avoiding both the cabal situation and the philistine scenario.\n\nAs to the idea that philosophy that is political shouldn't receive funding . . Er, so we abolish (by starving of funding) the entire subdiscipline of political philosophy? But perhaps you (emptythoughts) mean something else.\n\n[deleted]: &gt;I think that Stokes's worry is as follows. Politicians are starting from the idea that (at least quite a lot of) philosophy is useless\n\nHe offers no evidence of this.  He is remarkably defensive, as though questioning the usefulness of two government grants qualified as an attack on philosophy itself.\n\n&gt; The decision about which philosophy is useless, is being taken by people (politicians and electorates) who are crudely materialistic and philosophically naive and hence actually tend towards the view that pretty much all philosophy is useless and so should not be funded.\n\nNo offense, but the people whose money is being given out *should* have a say in where it goes.  That's kind of the whole point of democracy.  It doesn't matter whether or not the \"philosophers\" consider the majority to be \"philistines\" so long as the \"philistines\" are bankrolling them.  The arrogance of this terminology alone is uncanny.\n\n&gt;giving the funding decisions to experts in the field - overlooks the possibility that such people can form a self-serving cabal.\n\nThis is the best part.   Stokes offers a disclosure statement that says he has \"no relevant affiliations.\"  Yet he would stand to benefit financially from an increase in the government funding philosophy grants and stand to lose if those grants decreased.  He dismisses this obvious conflict of interests with a joke in the article.  It's borderline dishonest.  \n\n&gt;As to the idea that philosophy that is political shouldn't receive funding \n\nI'm not sure what the Australian laws are about public funding for political projects.  It's clear that this is not an objective study- as they have *already* arrived at an answer that is \"richer.\"  \njollyn: Thanks for this. (But) I will reply only to this part: \n\n&gt;[T]he people whose money is being given out should have a say in where it goes. That's kind of the whole point of democracy. It doesn't matter whether or not the \"philosophers\" consider the majority to be \"philistines\" so long as the \"philistines\" are bankrolling them. The arrogance of this terminology alone is uncanny.\n\nDemocracy does not entail that politicians and/or the general public *directly* determine research funding. For an electorate could decide, via their political representatives, to let the researchers themselves (or their peers, or similar) determine what gets funded. Moreover, I tend to think that this is what should happen (at least given the narrow materialism that I mentioned), although I admit (see previous post) that it has its own problems.\n\nAs to 'The arrogance of this terminology alone is uncanny': you deem my view arrogant because it dares to find some popular attitudes wanting? Aren't such judgements sometimes correct (i.e. aren't some popular attitudes ever wrong)? To quote a line from *1984*: sanity is not statistical.\n\n[Edited a few times to remove minor infelicities.]\n[deleted]: &gt;For an electorate could decide, via their political representatives, to let the researchers themselves (or their peers, or similar) determine what gets funded. \n\nAnd it stands to reason that this grant of authority could be withdrawn by the electorate in difficult economic times.\n\n&gt;you deem my view arrogant because it dares to find some popular attitudes wanting?\n\nNo, I deem the authors view arrogant because he dismisses critics of these two grants as 'Philistines' and not concerned citizens.  Moreover, he is content to demand that these Philistines continue to fund his profession.\n\nWhat we see here is not someone dispassionately assessing popular prejudices.  We see someone who feels his livelihood is being threatened and is lashing out irrationally.\njollyn: &gt;What we see here is not someone dispassionately assessing popular prejudices. We see someone who feels his livelihood is being threatened and is lashing out irrationally.\n\n'Irrationally' seems a bit strong, i.e. unwarrantly derogatory. Why not say instead simply that you find Stokes's reasoning inadequate? Also: strictly speaking, isn't 'We see someone who feels his livelihood is being threatened and is lashing out irrationally' in danger of committing the fallacy called 'ad hominem'?\n[deleted]: Irrationality has a meaning that is appropriate here.  I see no reason to sacrifice clarity for the sake of sensitivity.  \n\n&gt;strictly speaking, isn't 'We see someone who feels his livelihood is being threatened and is lashing out irrationally' in danger of committing the fallacy called 'ad hominem'?\n\nWouldn't the ad hominem have begun with Stokes characterization of the \"Philistines.\"  Or is it only impolite when the opposition characterizes one's motives?\n", "prompt": "jollyn: 'Waste not, want not \u2013 the politics of why philosophy matters' - philosopher Patrick Stokes reacting to philistinism in Australian government\n\n[deleted]: I'm not sure why the article and the other comments make the jump from \"government shouldn't fund certain grants in philosophy\" to \"", "orig": "philosophy is useless.\"  Are only things funded by the government useful?

{"full_text": "joelzaper: You understand that your gender has way more to do with social and psychological factors than your actual endocrine system, right? Gender is in your mind, you can\u2019t find it anywhere in the body, and therefor an endocrinologist doesn\u2019t have any tool to actually \u201cdiagnose\u201d it. That\u2019s why there are women with low estrogen, and men with low testosterone. It doesn\u2019t actually make them any more or less of the gender that they are.\nVajranaga: Actually, one's sexual identity IS in fact tied up with our hormones. A woman who has just given birth will lose most of her interest in her child if given hormone blockers. Men who have low testosterone are not nearly as interested in sex as those who have high testosterone. In fact, women NEED some testosterone in their system to be interested in sex AT ALL. Gender confusion comes when people find themselves not doing what is \"expected\" of them: low-estrogen women being not interested in children or low-testosterone men being not interested in sex or the usual sorts of things that interest men in general. I have yet to meet ANY transgender type whose hormone levels have been properly assessed by an endocrinologist- as opposed to the endocrinologist just being there to prescribe the gender-switch hormones. But then, the medical industry makes a FORTUNE off \"gender surgery\", so, let's face it: they are not about to 'rock the boat\" in this regard; an endocrinologist who suggested that trans people FIRST be checked for an imbalance to RULE OUT the possibility that a hormone imbalance is affecting the person's mental state would be HOUNDED out of the profession!\njoelzaper: I\u2019m missing your point. I never claimed hormones don\u2019t make us feel certain ways/do certain things. What I said was that gender isn\u2019t just related to the endocrine system. A masculine woman with high testosterone is just as much of a girl as a feminine girl with low testosterone. You can\u2019t actually quantify gender. Also, masculine trans girls exist, as well as feminine trans men.\nSo I don\u2019t get the point you\u2019re making?\nVajranaga: What I do know is this whole 'gender\" issue is a pile of nonsense invented by people with too much time on their hands and a bee in their collective bonnet.\njoelzaper: But how do you \u201cKnow\u201d that?\nVajranaga: How does anyone know anything? By OBSERVATION.\njoelzaper: Is that how we know things, though? The earth Looks flat, but scientifically we can use technology to observe things that otherwise we couldn\u2019t. Gender may Appear a certain way to you, but looks and interpretations are often deceiving. Maybe, just as we look to scientists to know that the earth is round, look to biologists and social scientists to understand gender and trans identity.\nVajranaga: Pretty sure all this 'gender confusion\" we see around these days is due to hormone disruptors in the environment, which is an OBSERVABLE phenomenon; no reason why it wouldn't affect HUMANS too. We aren't exempt from their effects. People need to start asking \"WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO US?\" instead of just assuming it's a \"natural development\".\njoelzaper: Having low testosterone doesn\u2019t make you trans. How do you explain trans male to female people who have high testosterone (even for men)? Because they do exist. But according to your theory, that wouldn\u2019t make sense.\nVajranaga: Haven't met any trans people who were ever actually evaluated for hormone irregularities as being behind their problem. When I say \"Did you ever consult an endocrinologist about the trans thing?\", they start rambling on about how the endocrinologist prescribes the hormones before surgery blah blah blah. Nothing about consulting one right off the bat to determine WHY a man is having thoughts about being \"a woman\"/a woman has thoughts about being \"a man\".\njoelzaper: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re understanding what I\u2019m saying. The reason they don\u2019t consult an endo is because being trans is not physical, it is psychological and cultural. Your hormones have Nothing at all to do with your gender. I don\u2019t know how many different ways I can say this. Having low testosterone doesn\u2019t make you want to be a woman. So what do you expect the endocrinologist to check for? Serious question. What is the endo supposed to check for?\nVajranaga: Such nonsense. A thousand different hormone disruptors in the environment and I am expected to believe that all this \"trans\" stuff is purely \"psychological\"? Please. Never met a transie who wasn't a whack job, in any case. The phenomenon of \"possession by the anima\" is definitely a psychological reality, I will concede.\njoelzaper: Your use of the words \u201ctranny\u201d and \u201cwhack job\u201d imply a certain amount of disdain and dislike for this group of people. If you genuinely thought outside environmental factors were effecting this group, wouldn\u2019t you be compelled to feel sorry and empathy for them? Consider the possibility that your emotional dislike for this group of people could make it more difficult for you to see the science of the situation. It\u2019s hard, I understand. If we accept that something is actually natural, we are forced to realize that our dislike and disgust is misguided, and that\u2019s hard. Trust me, I get endocrine disrupters. Im a type 1 diabetic, so I\u2019m forced to learn alllll about them, lol. But this is not the case in this situation. Keep in mind, I concede that disrupters might increase / decrease testosterone/estrogen levels. I agree with you there. My point is that this simply has nothing to do with being trans, as evidenced by the fact that there are many trans women who start off with high testosterone. From this, we can conclude that there are sources other than hormones that cause this to occur.\nVajranaga: We've all got problems. Yes, I do dislike the fact that MEN are trying to co-opt women's GENDER now, just like they have co-opted so many other things. Now we have perverts in dresses lurking in our washrooms and masturbating, and kids being administered hormones at an early age because they are being brainwashed into thinking they are \"trans\" when it is perfectly NORMAL to be \"gender-confused\" during the teen years..how is it that I know this but everyone else appears to have forgotten this fact? Or is it the medical industry concealing the fact so they can make even MORE money than they do now pandering to this \"trans\" nonsense?\njoelzaper: I think the issue is that you\u2019re starting with an assumption. You\u2019re starting with the idea that trans people are simply perverts. Can you not conceive of any other reason that someone would do this? Here\u2019s something to think about.

They made mistakes that I couldn\u2019t stand and I cut them off.  They might not have a clue. Should I let them know?\n\nFor example, there was a young guy whom I usually hung out with (I\u2019m a woman at least 10 years senior to him). He was very religious but he was obsessed with sex - I believed too much involuntary sexual abstinence and suppression worked on him in a perversive way. One time he asked me if women also masturbate. I answered \u201cYes. Of course. We also poop.\u201c hoping I could break his stupid fantasy over women. He asked if I also did masturbate. I said I did sometimes. Later at another event, we, along with a group, ate dinner. The group chatted a while waiting for the bill. He suddenly shushed the group and said, \u201cx(my name) said she masturbates. Let\u2019s hear how she does.\u201d \n\nThe way he spoke was genuine curiosity. People  puzzled and I got pissed. People soon ignored him and continued their chat. I got upset but pretended nothing had happened (I should\u2019ve slapped him or walked away, but at that moment, I didn\u2019t know how to handle such a situation and just wanted not to make any fuss out of it). \n\nI didn\u2019t have any business with him for some years. One time, there was a mutual friend sent both of us an email and expressed that she would like to meet us. I didn\u2019t want to meet them (she had also made some mistakes crossing the line and had no clue.) so I didn\u2019t meet them. He was desperate to meet with me though. \n\nHe had no clue. Should I have let him know? BTW, he is of no use in my life and it\u2019s better to stay away from him.

I don\u2019t see any benefit to you, except that maybe he will become aware of what an ass he was &amp; feel sufficiently ashamed of himself not pester you anymore.\nemergencyaccount4u: Thank you. I have cut many people off of me. Every incident has a very clear reason like the story above. Sometimes people backstabbed or disrespected me. I should admit that I could be part of the cause; I have a very friendly face, skinny physique, and, most of all, a weak personality which invite people to walk over me. I have been trying  to build clear boundaries - learning to ignore people -  but it is not easy. I just keep cutting people off when I cannot stand with them anymore. I don\u2019t think this is good but I also don\u2019t think they are worth for me to deal with. I wondered others\u2019 opinions. \nspanishneedle: Having a friendly face or being friendly is not an invitation to be walked on though! \n\nI\u2019ve cut people off too, though I admit I usually do tell them why...I can\u2019t seem to help it...I\u2019m emotional &amp; also, personally I usually feel bad just cutting people off. But there have definitely been times I\u2019ve looked back &amp; realized that I should not have said anything to end a particular friendship, but should\u2019ve let it die a slow death.\n\nAre you lonely after cutting people off? I am lonely, &amp; I question myself a lot. \n\nThen other times I think I\u2019m too nice. I have unresolved hurt feelings about the way some of my friendships ended...I wish I could understand more *why* they ended...if it was me, if it was them, if it would be worth it to reach out again...*sigh* \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSorry for going off on a tangent.

I want to give my kiddos some things they can climb this winter (and give myself a workout in the process.) How can I tell how much weight my ceiling joist can take? Floor joist are 2x10 boards (solid wood) spanning across the 12 ft room between the exterior wall and an interior wall. \n\nQuestion 1: Rock climbing wall will follow this general [plan](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/build-home-climbing-wall.html). I was going pin a 6x8 ft wall at a 30 degree angle spreading the weight across 5-6 joists with a 2x 10 going perpendicular to the joist about 40 inches away from the wall. Is that enough support the wall and climber?\n\nQuestion 2: I had the thought of hanging some additional things to climb across the ceiling such as monkey bars, a rope to swing on, or more horizontal climbing wall. Is there anyway to safely do that since it will be more towards the middle of the room?\nand-hereitcomes: 1. Those joists should be able to hold the weight of the wall with no problem. I recommend using 3/4 inch plywood tho instead of 1/2 inch. Will feel more sturdy. \n2. As long as you are going directly into those joists you shouldn\u2019t have any issue mounting monkey bars or other hanging things. \n \nI do not do construction personally, but I did build a home rock wall for the kids and have a 30 degree incline that I can climb and feel secure on\nArbutusPhD: It is also crucially important for point (2) that we know exactly what type of play equipment and regimens you intend to put in place.\nhobbyistunlimited: Something like this would be ideal: https://dealsformomsblog.com/2021/05/16/ninja-warrior-basement/\nnox_nox: If you are going to be inverted on the ceiling holds I would never trust lag bolts or any other vertically screwed anchor. You risk them pulling straight out of the wood and falling on your head/neck.\n\nThe only truly safe ceiling anchors are thru-bolted through the joists horizontally so you rely on the shear strength of the anchor bolt. Just make sure its anchored in the upper 1/3 of the joist so there is plenty of wood below the bolt.\n\nIf you must do some sort of vertical fastener then Climbing gym setups are the ideal solution for thru-bolting. I think they use at least 3/4\" plywood with rear metal anchors that bolts screw into. They are Best for a angled or vertical walls because you are using the shear strength of the bolt. But because they have a metal backing they are probably also ok for ceiling mounts. You could try to get extra large metal backings with a large washer to mitigate any potential pull through risk.\n\nAttach the plywood to the joists with carriage bolts (lots of them). That will distribute the load across the whole plywood and not just a single lag like the monkey bars in the link you posted. \n\nYou'll have to self tap all the screw holes for the metal anchors on the back side tho. Search custom rock climbing walls for lots of tutorials. \n\nAlso you may want to double check your homeowners insurance. They may not cover damage to the house structure if you happen to deform or break anything because of your use case.\n\nNot trying to be a downer but a person I knew fell from aerial equipment that failed and ended up partially paralyzed.\nkillerkennyAU: I have built multiple home climbing walls. Lag bolts (properly installed) are fine for attaching the main structure. Standard timber screws are fine for attaching the ply. \n\nJust use lots of them. The plywood spreads out the force. It also helps if your vertical walls support the ceiling sections. \n\nThe individual holds are attached with t-nuts and M10 (3/8 inch) socket head cap screws and bolts. They WILL NOT pull through 3/4\" (19mm) ply. \n\nWhat do you mean by \"self tap the metal anchors\"?\nnox_nox: Self tap: individually drill holes for each t-nut.\n\nSelf tap were the wrong words to say what I meant.\nkillerkennyAU: I understand. \n\nThat is some severe over-engineering in my opinion.

{"full_text": "Top_Conversation9940: How do I adapt my workouts to an injury?\nSo a day ago I strained my left rhomboid while doing an upper body workout. To provide some useful information on how the injury happened:\n\nFirst exercise in the workout I did was pull ups for 5 sets. The sets looked like 8-8-7-7-6 and 8 is the most reps I can do in a set so I was pushing myself pretty hard. This is the first time I tried arch body technique which I think is why the injury happened. Before I had been doing only hollow body pull ups which is more beginner friendly. Hollow body pull ups use more of your lats. Arch body puts more work on your upper back than the lats, which are way bigger so they can take more stress. Anyways, the injury actually occured in my next exercise which was chin ups. It's not because I did pull ups and followed that with chin ups, I have done that many times before with no problems and I used only hollow body technique. So the take away is beginners should only use hollow body and avoid arch body before reaching 10-12 reps of pull ups. And before building proper proprioception and mind-muscle connection.\n\nI need to give it time to recover but I also don't want to stop working. I have been working out for a few months now so not a complete beginner but still a beginner. How do I adapt my upper body workouts? Pull ups and chin ups are a no go, so are rows. Are there any pull movements I can do? Do I just do pushing movements?\nthergoat: Solid recovery strategy:\n\n1. Avoid active use of that muscle group (so, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, rows, face pulls, etc) altogether (push and pull) during workouts for 1-2 weeks. \n2. Get plenty of sleep\n3. Eat a nutritious diet \n4. Drink plenty of water \n5. Stretch within a comfortable range of motion (I.e. provide minor stimulation to the area)\n6.

{"full_text": "Your_People_Justify: From Universe to Subject, a Unified Account of Einstein's Revelations.\n*Why am I me, and not you? Why do I have an experience at all? What is the relationship between mind and matter? What is consciousness, and what is it made of?*\n\nSo the question has gone for centuries. Panpsychism is one such answer, it is very much in line with what Einstein is actually on the record as believing (Pantheism, the universe as the self realization of God).\n\nBut if experience is universal, how does that relate to the big picture? What is that Einstein actually thought? Beyond brief statements on transcendental essence, Spinoza, and some very *not brief* statements about the root ontology of laws - he never publicly detailed the nature of that transcendental worldview.\n\n What follows is a unified vision of reality in accordance with the science he revealed and the likely breakdown of what his beliefs entailed - a story of nature that directly accounts for our own subjectivity. \n\n--------\n\nRather than starting with people and working our way out to the universe, let's start with the universe and work our way into people.\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThe fields, spacetime and the quantum fields, are the universal fabric of reality. But \u200bwe know that it cannot experience itself as a whole (directly) because spacetime fabric is the least unified something could be without being nothing. Different observers can even observe events to happen in different orders - i.e. - the universe has no universal sense of time.\n\nEach point of spacetime can only 'connect' with what is immediately next to it ([locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality#:~:text=In%20physics%2C%20the%20principle%20of,%22action%20at%20a%20distance%22.)) but the point will not 'experience itself' as a point, for reasons I will get into shortly.\n\nEnergy (field vibration) exists within and travels via the fields, but energy left to its own devices just travels at that speed of causality (obviously - energy is just a vibration of reality). \n\nWhen you move that fast, you don't even have an experience of time. Photons, for instance, are things we observe, but there is no such thing as 'a perspective of a photon' - However, a photon is experienced *by* the fields. This can help us understand what I meant earlier - that any given point in spacetime can only regard experience-of-other - all updates within the field do not themselves have a point of view\n\n-----------\n\n\nSo we have these ingredients, now we combine them to form matter. **Elemental matter is the building block for embodied subjectivity**. Matter is special because it takes these ingredients of raw existence (fields and their vibration) and concentrates them, folding reality in on itself in a way that condenses 'experience-of-other' into 'experience-of-itself.' \n\nLiterally. When you put too much energy in one place, it all collapses in on itself, and the energy is trapped in a single place, a quantum of matter. It's like capturing causality and experience together in one really angry bottle. Something about this gives rise to subjectivity, I like to think of it as crumpling up the infinitesimal awareness of the fabric onto itself, like a dense mirror. \n\nMatter can slow down, it can experience time, it can experience itself. And, very importantly, it can come together to form *structure.* (quantum matter is itself the simplest form of structure - different amounts of energy can become ensnared in this way, and the exact tangling of that energy can vary - giving rise to a whole family of subatomic quantum)\n\n-------\n\nA structure will unify the experience of its elements by coordinating all of this awareness into one coherent thing - it does so by communicating and thus combining the sensations of the elements throughout the structure. Complicated structures can even take on an emergent vitality - maybe call it a process-structure - something that does not just have a stationary form but evolves its form over time due to its internal reactions and relationships. \n\nSo our brain is a complex process-structure, with a complex experience, because it unifies simple elements with simple elemental experiences. Quantums of matter have this elemental experience because matter is compactions of the infinitesimal awareness latent in fields.  \n\n\nVoila, embodied minds.\njsticebeaver: This explanation fails to properly tell us why only just some conglomerates of highly complex organizations of matter and energy are conscious and not all of them. If we were to create computers like those we have today at a complexity scale similar to that of the human brain, making a possible bit for every neuron we have, and made the computer able to transmit information between any 2 bits it wanted, then we would still not expect it to become conscious, we don't have a threshold, a limit that tells us at what level of complexity consciousness would emerge.\nYour_People_Justify: &gt;we don't have a threshold, a limit that tells us at what level of complexity consciousness would emerge.\n\nThe idea of a threshold is absurd. There is no threshhold. \n\nA level of experience is in all organizations of matter. Matter is a particular organization of energy (E = mc^2 ). To have an experience, to be able to react and persist in a place through time, is something that is innate in all matter.\n\nHuman consciousness is a complex modulation of that material experience that is complicated enough to speak on the issue. \n\nThe simplest instance of experience that would be a *familiar* form of self-awareness (that I know of) is the brain of a nematode. A nematode has about 300 neurons that we have mapped and simulated entirely, 1 Neuron appears to be responsible for telling The Nematode if something that it is looking at is part of the environment or part of itself. That sounds pretty useful.\n\nAnd onward up the chain we go, with ever more complex brains structures, until you reach the complexity of subjectivity and self-awareness, the thought of thoughts, that we call consciousness.\n\n**Re: Computer**\n\nWell, obviously just sitting there this most complex computer would not be conscious any more than a dead lump of brain matter is conscious (also, neurons do not work like bits). But, you could absolutely run *software* that simulates the brain functions, and add a vital flux to this process, and create a truely conscious entity.\n\nAh, you might say, the software is something new! But information (and what else is software?), is, as it happens, is just another way of describing physical stuff. Energy-Mass-Information equivalence is a known principle in physics. Any quantum, in particular, has an inherent amount of information (which, presumably, corresponds to whatever process has tangled the energy up within that piece of matter)\njsticebeaver: &gt; A level of experience is in all organizations of matter.\n\nAnd panpsychism is an even worse explanation, since in order to explain how certain physical systems organize themselves into being conscious, you simply say all physical systems have a degree of consciousness. That is similar to you asking why some humans have red hair, and me telling you that all human beings have a degree of red hair, and those you identify as red haired just have a higher degree. Obviously you would think the explanation is nonsense.\n\nThis is the same idea as the soul, the same idea as the platonic forms, the same idea as the aristotelian essences, it is all the same philosophy, in your case applied to the problem of consciousness.\nYour_People_Justify: There is no soul. Physics tells you what stuff does, experience tells you what doing that stuff feels like.\n\n&gt;That is similar to you asking why some humans have red hair, and me telling you that all human beings have a degree of red hair, and those you identify as red haired just have a higher degree\n\nAbsolutely not. The reasoning about consciousness is compelled to be qualitatively, fundamentally different from any other realm of scientific measurement. In the hair case, you could measure two different quantities **directly**, and you could say, ah, obviously this other hair is a different pigment. But subjectivity is only something we can experience from our own point of view - as the internal perspective of our particular hunk of matter.\n\nThere is only one definitive data point, the present moment. There are not obviously contradictory data points as you have put it.\njsticebeaver: It's the kind of explanation that's the same, to explain why we observe some matter to be conscious (ourselves for example) and other we don't observe it to be conscious, by saying that in fact all the matter is conscious, just to different degrees, is the same as explaining why we observe some humans to have red hair while we observe some other humans not to have it, by saying that in fact all humans have red hair, just to different degrees\nYour_People_Justify: &gt;and other we don't observe it to be conscious, \n\n1) You can only observe yourself to be conscious. You cannot 'observe' anything else to be conscious. We can only observe behavior.\n\n2) That is still fundamentally not describing the reasoning process here. It flows from breaking down the brain, and then building up to other things. \n\n**To uphold your criticism, I have not made that clear. We should not jump from brain to other things immediately.**\n\n---\n\nThink about what a conscious moment actually represents - i.e - some recursive loop of signals (a thought of thoughts) that other signals feed into.\n\nImagine what each signal pulse within that loop actually consists of - what would you see if you zoomed in? You would see (1) mostly empty space (2) electrons pushing quarks pushing on electrons pushing on quarks pushing on electrons etc. That is all there is. Where else could a \"sensation\" come from? How else could you feel a thought come in and have a new idea - if not for the physical insertion of a *physical thing* into the loop? And how else would that new bit of physical stuff pushing into the loop have a new quality (a perception, an idea, a thought, a feeling etc) in our consciousness? \n\nThe \"moment\" - the raw *presence*, the raw present moment sensation of having experience at all, obviously follows from an elemental sensation within the constituent elements of brain function. I see no other way.\n\nBut all matter is made of electrons and quarks. We are just a particular arrangement. Ergo, we should expect that constituent proto-experience, not consciousness or thought, just a raw moment itself - to be embodied in all matter.\njsticebeaver: I am not looking for reconstructing your reasoning here, I could if I felt it was relevant. I understand the reasoning, but what is worth criticizing is the explanation, and your explanation says nothing about the problem in question, which is explain why some physical systems have consciousness, while others don't. Your explanation says all of them have it, so it logically cannot answer the why of this distinction.\nYour_People_Justify: Not everything is conscious - everything experiences a raw sensation. But more to your point **yes** if you decide to invent a fictitious problem it will often be very hard to answer it!\njsticebeaver: You might well disagree the problem isn't real, that's legitimate. I'm just trying to get you to understand what the problem is that other people think exists. It's that people seem self aware and other animals seem to have a degree of inner life as well, while rocks, trees and electrons do not behave as if they have this subjectivity. It's an intuitive problem to some degree since we don't exactly know what consciousness is, so we're intuitively guessing that whatever it is, people and animals have it while rocks and trees do not. The problem is explaining why that is so. Your idea doesn't address this problem, merely side steps it. If you aren't interested in that problem because it's fictitious, then that's totally ok.\nYour_People_Justify: I'm still very interested in the problem when you put it this way! - **how** consciousness - the human variant - works. There's a lot of valuable research to be done between neuroscience (wetworks) and information theory (software)\n\nBut **why** it feels as it does involves no fundamental difference between these different objects you list. They all absolutely behave as if they have subjectivity. They don't have consciousness, but there is still a form of subjectivity.\n\nTake an electron, it runs into another electron and bumps off. Why? It 'feels' a field repulsion - that \"feeling\" is synonymous with the overlapping of charge fields and then the change in velocity that sends it the other way. It is a raw moment with no memory or self recognition, but it is the building block for more complex feelings.\n\nIt's just a difference of degrees - one that correlates to more less complicated structures, more or less complicated functions.\n\nOur inner life has a million more degrees, dimensions, and richness, while the inner life of an electron is, well,  one dimensional.\njsticebeaver: &gt;Why? It 'feels' a field repulsion - that \"feeling\" is synonymous with the overlapping of charge fields and then the change in velocity that sends it the other way. It is a raw moment with no memory or self recognition, but it is the building block for more complex feelings.\n\nThis is just an intentioned way to translate to natural language what we know of from mathematical language - it's misleading. What happens when an electron hits another one is described in mathematical language; what happens when I remember my grandma is dead is described in the language of what I feel.\n\nGranted you are no physicist and have little knowledge of physics, so it's no surprise you'd conflate the interactions between particles with interactions more close to your background knowledge such as feelings. But what you are doing is not taking the explanations of physics in their own terms, and instead adapting them to fit your previously established intentions. You pretend to be talking about physics, when in reality you are talking about electrons which feel - there is no theory about the feelings of electrons.\n\nI can show you the theory that describes the interactions between different particles, it's been heavily criticized, improved for years, stands up to the experimental tests we know to put it through. But you cannot show me the theory that describes the feelings of particles, because there is none. There is only the vague metaphysical theory that all matter carries an element of experience, this \"proto-consciousness\", and that theory solves no problem whatsoever.\nYour_People_Justify: &gt;it's misleading\n\n Math alone just describes the aftermath, it is a model, a way of describing behaviors. It is not synonymous with reality itself. Interpreting that as if it proves 'zombie materialism' is misleading. Further, I have made it clear I have no issues with taking those models on their own terms. But you err by overextending those 'terms' to 'all that there could possibly be to say about the situation.'\n\n&gt;and have little knowledge of physics, \n\nI have a 4 year degree in Mechanical Engineering. I spent years of my life exclusively dedicated to studying physics and the applications of physics. \n\nYou're being rude, and worse, you're being rude when you are **fundamentally mistaken** about the tools and language the scientific method provides to help us understand reality.\njsticebeaver: My point is that the real explanations of those mathematical formalisms speak of positions, pressures, velocities, masses, energies - nothing about feelings and perceptions. Not to say there isn't a tradition of interpreting physics in that subjective vein, it's a long tradition.\nYour_People_Justify: I agree! I have been saying that the whole time! And when you look at a living, feeling, thinking brain *from the outside* that is also all you will ever see - positions, pressures, velocities, masses, energies. \n\nAnd yet we *know* that that these **quantities** are not all there is to say - because we *know* those positions, pressures, velocities, masses, and energies in our brain undeniably, irrefutably render as our own subjective experience. Qualities!\n\nWhat something *does*, is not all that it *is*.\njsticebeaver: &gt;What something does, is not all that it is\n\nI interpret this as you saying physical brain states, observed and described as the trajectories of electricity currents in the neurons, are, on top of those trajectories, also subjective experiences. From the outside the brain states look like electricity currents being turned on and off between millions of neurons, but from the inside the brain states look like our various subjective experiences. The one thing in itself can be described and observed from the two perspectives, and this reveals that the apparently different things we observe from each perspective, are but 2 ways of the same thing.\n\nI don't agree with this philosophy. While I do believe that it is the physical electrical currents of the neurons that are responsible for our subjective experience, in the sense that these currents constitute computations, those subjective experiences are not the same thing as the physical substrates that create them. Just the same way as this text I'm typing on a text box in the firefox internet browser program, is not the same thing as the processor and pixels which render and are responsible for creating the program.\n\nOur mind and our brain are different things, equally real. Our mind encompasses not only \"consciousness\" and \"conscious states\", but our knowledge, our memories, our intuitions, our feelings, etc, all which are real, but not the same as the computations performed by our brain states. In no sense are these 2 sides of the same coin.\nYour_People_Justify: Precisely. Yes.\n\nAlthough I would add that human conscious experience is irreducible - it only exists as its own thing (with thoughts, feelings, etc) when regarded as a whole - the whoooole networked combination of elemental experiences of the \"self aware\" brain subroutine.\n\n---\n\nTo analogize with the computer - the keystroke is the input, the screen is an output - and the processor renders a simple, singular experience in its function while connecting the two. \n\nA program describes (linear or networked) relationships of that whole series of intermediate steps that, when executed, contains the experience of processor function.\n\n--\n\nOur senses are our inputs, our muscles and such are outputs, and consciousness renders a singular, complex experience in its function while connecting the two.\n\nThere is a 'mental software' in the brain that describes the networked relationship of intermediate steps that, when executed, contains the experience of consciousness.\njsticebeaver: I was not analogizing, I was saying the same thing is occurring, the same fundamental physical process. It's a physical system being used to simulate all other physical systems. Our minds do that by creative explanation, creating explanatory knowledge, our current computers can't do this, we don't know how to program them to do this. But both our minds and our computers are exploiting the same universal physical regularity.\n\nAnalogizing our \\*minds\\* and computers or computer programs is bound to be misleading, since we don't know what makes the program in our brain different from the programs we can program our computers with. When we do know this, then we'll be able to program a computer with what will then be a person.\n\nAlso, what computers and our minds render isn't \"experience\", it's much richer than that. Your mind as a whole is much more than experience, it's inexplicit knowledge, it's unexperienced information processing, it's knowledge about unexperienced things.\nYour_People_Justify: Well, I guess I mostly agree. Consciousness is a PITA to talk about because all of the science is so new, so nobody has common definitions, people talk past each other allll the time by mistake. \n\nThe one difference we do know, to add, is that computers use bytes, step by step linear instructions, while our brains are continuous networks that don't use if-then-else statements.\n\nAlso, I guess I don't understand what you mean by 'mind' not being synonymous with 'computation by brain states' - i.e. I agree it is not the same thing as everything happening within the brain (we have unconscious brain functions) - but to me Consciousnes is just the subroutine that is most self-referential, it takes in all of this data (thoughts, short term memory, senses) at once, and in so  doing must consider *itself* as part of the data in that moment. Boom, self awareness.\n\nIn other words that \"creative explanation\" is just a 'loopy' mental computation that consumes these other 'more linear' computations (i.e. when we remember something, or a sense, or a though that 'bubbles' in) and then outputs responses (like speech)\n\nLoop is a bad word, it's more of a whirling swirling 'flux' - imagine a fluid swirling around in a sphere - but hopefully you know what I mean.\n\nWhich also gives me an intuition as to why we we sleep, since this would be by far the most taxing and complicated function that the brain performs.\njsticebeaver: &gt;In other words that \"creative explanation\" is just a 'loopy' mental computation (...) Loop is a bad word, it's more of a whirling swirling 'flux' - imagine a fluid swirling around in a sphere\n\nThis is exactly what our minds cannot be like. A repeating loop enclosed in a defined space is the mentality of the closed society, of the individual of a culture which rewards him for complying with the taboos and norms and enacting them with ever greater precision, and which punishes him for deviating from the norm and attempting innovation. We however are unlike this in our open society. We create new knowledge, and in this way we break with old habits and evolve our customs, taboos, practices, behaviors and so on.\n\nGPS, nuclear power, televisions and computers, electricity - the knowledge of how to achieve all of these things in the world this was created by people, and it wasn't in their minds until they created it. Their minds weren't loops, or fluxes swirling, they were engaged in problems, and had to guess new things to solve them.\nYour_People_Justify: Okay fine but we weren't talking about that next step. We were talking about what we have that, say, a bat also has. \n\nBut I agree, our brain-experience is uniquely different from a bat-experience, and I misspoke by reducing that to just being 'a more complex neural network'\n\nIf we must change tracks (because I do have an answer):\n\nOur social nature creates the emergence of meaning, agency, morality, etc. Our perception of reality is *engulfed* by this social nature - by grammar, meaning, reason, etc - we can't do anything BUT engage with our perceptions in this way. Our cognition is 'structured' by this emergent, higher order relationship. This is what makes humans distinct from most animals.\n\nHowever **all of that meaning and knowledge** is ultimately realized via discrete brains - same as a singular-brain experience is realized via discrete constituent elements. It's same mechanics of emergence on a new stage.\njsticebeaver: The same argument applies against this idea that meaning, agency, morality (kinds of knowledge) emerge from our \"social nature\", or from \"social situations\" or from our \"social context\". While it is true that together in critical communities we are better able to create meaning, discover moral answers faster and improve the range of transformations over which we have agency, none of this knowledge comes from our social nature. Knowledge creation is fundamentally a break with the prevailing social context, it disrupts prevailing ways of understanding the meanings of words, it often counters prevailing moral theories. \n\nIt always originates within a single mind yes, but those minds aren't tied to their social context in order to make progress. Instead we just guess it, and a guess can come from anywhere - from a dream, from a hunch, from an intuition, from something we saw in a newspaper, from a trip to the mall we took last week.\n\nWhat makes people distinct from animals is that we can do this, we can guess explanations and criticize them in our minds. Other animals cannot do this, and all progress humans have ever made that differentiates our ways of living from theirs, has come from guessing better explanations about the world. While the squirrel species had to wait for thousands of generations for it to be a prevailing behavior of theirs to hide their nuts in order to feed off them later, humans need only for a single person to create a more efficient way to keep vegetables refrigerated to be able to feed millions more people. A single squirrel cannot have a new idea and share it with his squirrel friends. If a new squirrel does display a new behavior, then the genetic mutation which occurred in him to cause that new behavior must be better than other variants of itself at spreading through the population, in order for the other squirrels to also display that behavior.\nYour_People_Justify: There is no such thing as knowledge that is beyond the Symbolic - where language is one feature of the symbolic order. The Symbolic is an irreducible emergent phenomena of our social nature and it is entirely inescapably the manner of your perception.\n\nA language (more broadly - a symbolic order) contains the set of all possible meanings, whether or not someone has thought to utter one of those meanings, whether or not that meaning is internally coherent - is immaterial. \n\n*Ajshsvanalala, slwhahwuaj, 1 = 1, dog ran blue for type, nice eye eye eooslslah, love one another, 26w91yq8q7, blue red green wow. etc.* All possible combinations. Some are useful (corresponding to our experience) most are not.\n\nKnowledge does not come from anywhere particularly mysterious, it comes from objective/subjective experience and, by way of language, is our way of discovering one of those meanings that do happen to be coherent and useful.\n\n&gt; A single squirrel cannot have a new idea and share it with his squirrel friends.\n\nPlenty of animals have rich and complicated social natures, and can even learn from each other, develop accents, use tools, etc. Our social nature and brain complexity are self reinforcing and came from those kinds of patterns we still see in the wild - which has created this breakaway process you describe.\n", "prompt": "Your_People_Justify: From Universe to Subject, a Unified Account of Einstein's Revelations.\n*Why am I me, and not you?

I know what my short term training structure is and I know when it's gonna end and I was wondering what I wanted to do next.\n\nCurrently I am finishing Level 1 of Calisthenic Movement's program. There are 5 levels and going through 1 to 5 takes about 1 year and a few months I think.\n\nWhen I'll have completed CM's program I don't think I'll get on skills training. It seems a lot of people start calisthenics and quickly want to start training levers, planche, etc. It seems wiser to me to train basic movements strength for a few years before training the levers or planche. Would you agree ? I like to take some perspective and remind myself that I want to train for strength, looks, etc, but also longevity and I think in 20 years when I'll look back, waiting 2 or 3 years before training hard BW skills will seem like nothing and I'll be happy with my decisions.\n\nI think I'd be interested after CM's program by GMB's floor program to learn basic locomotion movements and develop further body awareness.\n\nAfter that, I don't know.\n\n\nWhat are your plans for future training ? \nJPSYCHC: Start \ngrimgrau: I'm wishing you some luck and sending you good vibes so you can follow through and start working out.\n\nMay I ask what you feel has been keeping you from starting?\nJPSYCHC: I'm coming out of a heroin addiction I am only 10 days clean but I finally feel good physically. \ngrimgrau: 10 days clean from heroin is still a difficult thing to accomplish. Every day, even every hour for a long time past 10 days can stretch on for eternity. I've known many people who became addicted to opiates and opioids and it's really tough. Getting through the withdrawals seems to be like absolute hell.\n\nIf you didn't know already there's an awful lot of research out there that shows that cardiovascular exercise can help a ton with recovery, though. Strength training is also a big help, but from what I've read and heard it's the cardio that seems to do the most good.\n\nIf you can even bring yourself to do just a few exercises at first that'll still be great. You don't necessarily have to do the entire routine the first few times through.\n\nHere's hoping you can continue on the path to recovery. :)\nJPSYCHC: Thanks man. I think I can even though I have failed so many times already. I appreciate this \ngrimgrau: The important thing is that you're trying again even though you haven't succeeded before. Like I said it's really tough to get off of heroin and I know full well that you know that. The addiction is so fucking insidious. The way it hijacks your brain is just evil.\n\nIs it possible that you may be able to get into some sort of medication maintenance program? I know that those programs have pretty strict rules, but I've known some people who were able to get off of the heroin by taking suboxone or methadone for a while and then, eventually, taper off.\n\nSome people need to be on it long-term, but in some cases that can be a lot better than having to go out and think about how to score more heroin. Firstly, it eliminates the illegality of possession and some of the stuff people might do in order to score. Secondly, there's a LOT of cut heroin out there these days. There's no telling what might be in the stuff and with the crap that some people are cutting it with one shot, sniff, or smoke could mean instant death. Fentanyl and carfentanyl are outright instant killers compared to heroin on its own.\n\nWhatever path you choose I wish you the best of luck.\nJPSYCHC: I am on suboxone and in an IOP\n\nMy dope had fent in it, I know because I tested positive for it regularly. But believe it or not in my state, I considered that a good thing. It made it better\n\nThe risk though, regardless of tolerance, is if it isn't mixed well and you get a hot spot. Then even Kurt Cobain would be a dead man. \ngrimgrau: Oh, I completely understand if the dope is stronger than usual even if it's fent, I mean, so long as it isn't the last time you use it of course if you get what I mean. If you use drugs and you get more bang for your buck you're probably going to see that as a bonus no matter which drug it is.\n\nI used to have a huge polysubstance addiction/abuse problem in my mid to late 20's for about 4 years, but my main choice of drug was anything psychedelic. I wasn't addicted to one drug. I was addicted to being altered, preferably on psychedelics. I tripped on so many things so often that to this day I still see motion trails any time something moves and haloes around lights. Fortunately that's it and it doesn't negatively interfere with my life, but when I found a hookup for LSD I ended up doing so much so often I wound up in the emergency room a few times having no fucking clue how I got there. I inherited some $20,000'ish in stocks and I blew almost all of it on LSD, weed, and electronics. Psychedelics aren't even supposed to be addictive. No physical addiction or withdrawal, but I got to the point where I couldn't make it through a week without tripping on something or otherwise getting high. Never messed with meth, cocaine/crack, or opiates though.\n\nI ended up in treatment a few times because of that. That's when I met people who had similar problems or were hooked on other things like heroin. So I know how tough it is. If my addiction had a physical dependence component where I'd go into physical withdrawal and felt like I was dying without getting high man, I don't even know what would have happened to me. It was bad enough that my mind and my emotions SCREAMED for me to need to be under the influence to get through a week or even a few days. SO glad that's in my past now.\n\nIt also doesn't help that it turns out that I also have bipolar disorder, but I've been stable on medications for a very long time now and have been slowly getting my life back in order. Fortunately for me I've been heading down a very good path for a long time, but I understand what it's like to be addicted and to be in treatment and everything. I've met some cool people along the way and hadn't seen them for years only to find out that they're no longer here.\n\nApart from finding medications that keep me 100% stable and fine, exercise has helped me through BIG TIME and ever since I've been regularly exercising in some way, at the very least always doing some sort of cardio.\n\nIf you ever have any questions about bodyweight fitness or just need to talk feel free to hit me up. I've been doing bodyweight exercise for 2 and 1/2 years now and I'm about to turn 35. I'm getting older and I'm at the point where I can't even imagine partying anymore. I need my sleep! I'm happy to answer any of your questions about this stuff or to just read whatever you have to say. If you don't feel comfortable replying in a comment you can send me a private message.\n\nIf there's anything that I can do to help no matter how small it is I feel like in some way I've been through some of the same shit and I'll respond to you even if it takes me a few days (I'm not always online.)\n\nTake care!\n", "prompt": "SweelFor: What is your mid/long term plan for BWF training?\nHi everyone\n\nFor these past few days I have been thinking about how I would like to structure my training in the mid/long term.

Can you?\nSaltyFresh: False robbery accusations can ruin your life too.\n\nI didn\u2019t read any of your diatribe beyond that ridiculous argument.\nSafe-Interview-689: I was going to ask you to point out a case of a false robbery accusation that absolutely destroyed the reputation of an individual for life, but what's even the point. You won't listen or even engage in a discussion about a topic that is important to both of us. Good luck trying to convince people of your world view when you won't engage or listen to people who disagree with/don't understand your ideas.\nSaltyFresh: Again, I read only like the first 16 words and my answer is:\n\nKavanaugh got elected to Supreme Court justice\n\nTrump got elected to president\n\nKobe is revered\n\nWoody Allen revered\n\nCosby is out of jail as of yesterday.\n\nTell me again how ACTUAL RAPE ruins offender\u2019s lives. \n\nBut of course if all the things I listed it\u2019s the hysteria over false accusations that you clung to. So predictable. Predictable cuz you know why? Cuz we live in a rape culture and the first thing you have to do if you want to prop up rape culture is pretend it doesn\u2019t exist and if it DOES exist then it\u2019s the perpetrators of sexual assault that are the *real* victims here.\nSafe-Interview-689: First off, you never read my full argument, so don't say I clung to false accusations only. Now let me provide some counter arguments for lives that were ruined due to false accusations since YOU are the one who brought it up first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDustin Toth was accused of kidnapping and raping Katherine Bennett. Katherine later admitted she made it up, but not after Dustin Toth lost his job and had his social life ruined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrian Banks was accused of raping one of his classmates at 16 years old. He spent 5 years in prison until his accuser admitted she made it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMalik Hilaire and another student was accused of gang raping one of their classmates at a party. Malik lost his scholarship and was forced to leave school. She later admitted she had consensual sex with them, but said it was rape as not to upset another classmate she was interested in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArmaan Premjee was accused of rape, but was proven innocent due to security camera footage. Despite being proven innocent, he still lost his scholarship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow as for the people you mentioned, those people have insane amounts of power. They are part of the 1% and have the ability to get away with practically anything. Not because the rest of us shrugs it off and says \"Yeah that's fine because rape is no biggie\". Normal middle class and lower class individuals have an absolute hatred for those who commit rape. That isn't to say there aren't people who think rape isn't a big deal, but that is a very very small portion of the population and anyone who thinks that way should be ostracized for it. And before you go and say I'm excusing the behavior of the elite because they have power, I'm not. They should be held accountable same as the rest of us.\nthrownthefuckaway57: I saw the video footage of Premjee. How did it prove he didn't rape her? All it proved is that at some point she was willingly kissing him. Am I missing something?\nSafe-Interview-689: Both Premjee and his accuser were drunk. His accusers roommate told her about them having sex last night and she didn\u2019t remember, that\u2019s why she filed a rape report. The security camera footage showed that she was the one who initiated the encounter, and continued to lead Premjee all the way to her dorm room. Now of course we can\u2019t say for sure about what happened inside the dorm room, but Premjee\u2019s accuser had no physical evidence that she was forced into sex, nor could she even recall that night due to her intoxication. Before the tapes were even presented in court, Premjee was charged with rape and if it wasn\u2019t for those tapes, he would very likely be in prison now. That means he was assumed guilty before proven innocent, which is NOT how our judicial system works/should work.\nthrownthefuckaway57: I see. That still leaves room for rape because we don't know how drunk she was compared to him and she could've changed her mind once they were in the room regardless of how she behaved beforehand. Having said that, this is why these things are so messy. It would be more cut and dry if she was the only one who was impaired. But they both were, so how and where do you draw the line regarding consent? Each case is different, I guess. I don't think there's a happy medium in these cases because we either potentially have a rape victim not getting justice or someone being punished for something they didn't do, though someone being an actual victim of rape is more likely than someone being falsely accused. What a mess. Apologies for rambling.\nSafe-Interview-689: Right, I agree. There is a possibility that she was raped, but with no evidence or any credible witnesses, it's impossible to know for sure what happened.\nthrownthefuckaway57: Yep. Very true. Sad either way.\n", "prompt": "HDMI13: A recently discovered version of the first on-screen kiss between two Black actors has surfaced at the National Library of Norway\n\nSaltyFresh: Prolly not the first time snd definitely mot the last seeing glorifying and excusing sexual assault on screen.

{"full_text": "Bubbawilcox: Looking for opinions before I start building a side opening lift storage bed\nI am working on designing/building a queen size bed frame that will lift from one side opening a storage area inside the frame. The mattress will be lifted on a set of hinges and struts like in the last pictures. This is a bigger project than I have taken on before I wanted to get some opinions on if it seems like this should work. [Here] (https://imgur.com/a/LwKzSFg#WuLTuVB) is the design I did Sketchup that I will be working from. \n\nThe frame itself is 3/4\" plywood with reinforced with a frame of 2x4's and 4x4 legs.\n\nThe frame the mattress will sit on is 1 1/2\" angle iron, with 3/4\" plywood for the bottom panel.\n\nThe hinges will likely be [these](https://www.woodcraft.com/products/selby-bed-storage-gas-piston-lift-mechanism-48-210-lb-capacity-set-of-2), unless I find something that would work better prior to beginning the project.\n\nWill the angle iron frame be sufficient to support everything? While up it would need to support roughly 100-150lbs just on this hinges that are rated for up to 210lbs. When down the frame will rest on the 2x4 frame and 4x4 legs, it would need to support roughly up to 600lbs between the mattress, bedding, and 2 people sleeping on it.\n\nI will need to notch the 2x4 frame where the bottom angle iron support will come below the frame of the bed but I didn't put that into the sketch up model. Are there any noticeable significant issues I have missed or overlooked with this? My main concern is the frame the mattress will sit on, but I have not been able to find much info on what kind of weight can be expected from something like 1.5\" angle.\njerkITwithRIGHTYnewb: You need slats across the opening where the mattress will sit or you\u2019re sayin you\u2019re going to seat the iron frame into it? If your using a box spring that will be fine otherwise you will want to just make 1x4 slats to support the mattress. I\u2019m not sure on spacing but you can look that up.\nBubbawilcox: The iron frame with the 3/4\" plywood inside will work as the platform for the mattress so no box spring will be needed. The iron frame has a bit of angle iron that extends down below the rest, I'll need to cut a notch into the 2x4 frame if the bed frame so that the iron frame will rest evenly on the 2x4's.\njerkITwithRIGHTYnewb: I\u2019d toss the frame and just put in slats. 1x4 is dirt cheap. Probably cost you $30. Cheaper than plywood and more lightweight. You are planning to use furniture quality plywood on the outside which is more expensive but even a normal piece of plywood and you will need 2 is $35 or more. Plus you will have issues with the seem on the plywood, slats will eliminate that issue. I don\u2019t know about the spacing on that iron frame either. The plywood wood likely sag over time if it\u2019s like the ones I\u2019m thinking of.\nBubbawilcox: I was planning on using 3/4\" T&amp;G plywood glued at the seam and supported by the center angle. You don't think that would be enough to prevent sagging over time better than 1x4 slats? If the center support likely wouldn't be enough I could also add a leg in the middle of that support, or another piece of angle going across the middle of the long side.\n\nI know the plywood would be more costly than usong slats, but my thinking was if another $40-50 would make for a more stable platform it may save me from having to worry about replacing them later. And I'll already be spending a few hundred anyway, another $50 won't kill me for furnature I don't plan on replacing for a long time.\njerkITwithRIGHTYnewb: I\u2019ve never seen a bed frame built with a piece of plywood, put it that way.

{"full_text": "aminalbackwards: I built a low-budget TV stand in my apartment\n\ncurebaldness: Looks great but you need a bigger TV to do the stand justice.\naminalbackwards: I got an itch for a 65\" that I really shouldn't scratch right now...\n\nThank you!\nBloodOnTheTracks: Look at the TCL 6 Series. The 65\" model has been on sale a lot lately and punches way above its price range.\naminalbackwards: I'm totally naive when it comes to TV's. What makes the 6 series better than say the cheapest thing at Walmart? Worth the extra few hundred bucks?\nBloodOnTheTracks: Hey, sorry for the latent reply! I recently did a lot of research on TVs, buying my own last year. The 6 Series received lots of praise from reviewers. They've been out about 6 months, so the price has dropped (they can be had in the $600-700 range on sale, versus the $999 launch price). The 6 Series offers 4k, HDR, Dolby Vision and a great Roku operating system. It also looks more expensive than it is, with a handsome metal bezel. \n\nThe real value proposition is that it rivals TVs costing twice as much in terms of picture quality. Anecdotally, I bought a great 65\" Sony last year as my main TV, but also ended up buying a 55\" TCL 6 Series for a small den a few months later. After owning the two over the last 6 months, I can say the TCL is a hell of a lot of picture quality for the price. The Sony is great and I don't regret it, but if I had to replace it, I'd save myself half the cash and buy a 65\" TCL 6 Series and not look back! \n\nThis advice really only applies if you care about things like color accuracy, HDR performance and you stream a lot of newer content from Netflix/Hulu/Amazon (which all increasingly support 4k HDR &amp; Dolby Vision content). If you don't care about that sort thing, the cheapest 65\" at Walmart will probably be the TCL 4 Series, which isn't half bad either. Just wanted to plug the 6 Series because it's one of those golden products that is really hard to beat for the price. It's rare to find something that is the best in its price category.\naminalbackwards: Thanks for all the detail. Sounds like either way a TCL is a good buy. I definitely want to do my research. Is the HDR you're talking about the same as HDR in photography? For a casual TV watcher would you say the extra $200-300 for the 6 is worth it? I also saw a 65\" curved samsung at Target on clearance for $650 iirc. Thoughts on something like that?\nBloodOnTheTracks: If it is the UN7300, that's a great price, but personally, I don't love the curved screens. Someone mentioned the site RTings and that really is a great resource for TV shopping. They ranked the Samsung at 7.5 and the TCL at 8.0, just to give you some idea. I think the TCL is still their reigning \"budget\" champion. [Here's a review to get started](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/6-series-r617-2018).\n\nOh and yes, HDR is similar that in photography. Still means high dynamic range. It's a newer content format mean to show a greater range of color and brightness. For TVs that support HDR, this generally means they're capable of a wide color gamet but also capable of hitting higher peak brightness. So in a movie scene where you see the sun or bright headlights, a TV with good HDR performance will make you feel blinded. Most of Netflix's original content is HDR. Once you're accustomed to it, non-HDR content will seem a little dull!\naminalbackwards: Okay another question. I hate when movies and shows play at 30fps instead of 24fps (other than things like news, documentaries, stuff like that). It seems like a lot of newer TVs that friends have automatically play movies in 30fps, which I hate cause it makes the movie look cheaply made to me. My understanding is that this is based on refresh rate. Is this something that can be changed in the settings of a newer TV, or do most TVs have a fixed rate? It seems nitpicky, but it's always bothered me to watch a movie in 30fps. Thanks.\nBloodOnTheTracks: That's usually caused more by the \"motion smoothing\" features found in most modern TVs. It is sometimes called the Soap Opera Effect. It can be nice for sports (gives it that \"you're actually there\" sort of look), but it is [widely hated by lots of people including directors.](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/12/17849560/tv-motion-smoothing-reference-mode-nolan-anderson) Annoying, most TV manufacturers have it turned on automatically, so lots of people think that's just how they're TV looks. I turn motion smoothing (and it usually has specific names on different TVs; Sony calls it MotionFlow) off on any TV I own and use whatever \"cinema\" mode they have as the basis for setting up the default picture. I usually do it to family members' TVs, too, if it is someone who I know won't ever question the way their TV looks (like my mom). That website RTings has recommend settings for most TVs they review, to get the most out of a TV and they are not big fans of motion smoothing either!\naminalbackwards: Thank you! Good to know it can be turned off.\nBloodOnTheTracks: Yeah, I didn't know much about it either until my sister bought a really nice LG OLED tv a few years ago and it gave her husband motion sickness!

{"full_text": "kameo315: Making A Control Board for the House Wide, Arduino Controlled Audio System! (Full Write-up in Comments)\n\nseinarcorps: I want to do something exactly like this for my house, but I've got relatively little electronics experience (just an \"electrical engineering for mechanical engineers\" course back in college). It seems pretty straightforward and you've done a really good detailed job of walking through it all...think I could pull it off? \n\nIf I've got this understood correctly, the Arduino is just used as a wireless audio switch with a web based output switch/volume control, right? How hard is it to add in more speakers? I'd need 8 outputs vs your 6, I think. You mentioned daisy chaining the control boards...could you walk through that process? \n\nI also have two HTPC's...I can see that it would be easy to replace your Chromecast with the audio out from one of them. I'd also like to be able to have multiple inputs (ie, someone listening to music in one room and someone watching a movie in another). After reading all of this, my 'solution' would be to build two identical setups (one for each HTPC) and run two sets of speaker wire to each setup. How dangerous is that, if two people try to play different things through the same set of speakers? Is there an easier solution to multiple inputs?\n\nThanks for posting this; it's exactly the motivation I needed.\nkameo315: The only real skills you need to build it are basic soldering and following instructions so I'm pretty sure you can pull it off. I'm here to help if you have any questions too. \n\nAs for the arduino it just interprets the commands from the phone and sends them to the volume control board. It's basically acting as a mini Web server.\n\nSince you need 8 outputs (4 zones) I recommend buying the amp I recommended and then for your least used zone using something like a Lepai 2020a+. It's a cheap little amp that will do the job. \n\nYou will however need to make two of the PT2258 control boards. For daisy chaining them all you need to do is connect 5V and GND plus the two I2C data lines from one board to the other. It's pretty easy. The one catch is you should connect the Code2 pin to GND on one board and to 5V on the other. \n\nFor the 2 HTPCs I would suggest you actually make 3 PT2258 control boards and then have control over two inputs for each zone. Since you have 4 zones you would have two volume controls for each zone. One for each HTPC. Then you could wire the two outputs of the volume control board together using a 3.5mm splitter and plug them into the amp. That would only require one speaker wire to each speaker and would be completely harmless if two people tried to listen to different things in the same zone. \n\nSorry if that last bit was unclear. I can draw up a wiring diagram if you want. \n\nseinarcorps: &gt; Since you need 8 outputs (4 zones) I recommend buying the amp I recommended and then for your least used zone using something like a Lepai 2020a+. It's a cheap little amp that will do the job.\n&gt; \n\nHere I am shopping all over for an amp that has two more 100w outputs and you are all outside the box with your 6+1 solution. That's simple enough. \n\nOnce two boards are chained together, would you just use a splitter from the initial audio source and plug it into the input of both control boards?\n\nI think this will help me a ton. I read through the other thread that got deleted, and it seems like zone control with multiple inputs is a problem...if I made liberal use of splitters between the control boards and the amps, would that conceivably allow me to have as many inputs as I have control boards, and the only danger would be me trying to play several streams through any given speaker? The sound from that speaker might get messy with multiple inputs, but it shouldn't blow up or anything, right?\n\nkameo315: Basically you need one channel of control for each possible combination of zone/source. For example in your case with two possible inputs you need one zone of control for each zone on each input so that's 2 inputs * 4 zones * 2 speakers a zone = 16 channels of control so 3 PT2258 boards. \n\nAnd you're correct about the splitters. You can have as many inputs to each system as you want as long as you use enough splitters and PT2258s. If you try and play both inputs through the same speaker it will sound like Shit but the speaker will be fine. I think if you had run two amps to one speaker and did the same thing it could damage it though. \nseinarcorps: Cool beans. Now to convince the wife that I need to mount speakers everywhere, lol. Thanks for your advice...you might hear back from me if I can't tweak the code to add in all those channels :). \ndjx18: I am thinking of doing the same but with 6 zones, so 2 PT2258 Boards total of 12 channels. How would I wire the two [amps] (http://www.parts-express.com/24-vdc-146a-350w-regulated-switching-power-supply--320-316)? Do I also need two relays to kill the power from both amps? Is there a different way of wiring them together?\nDo I buy a different amp ? \n\nThanks!\n", "prompt": "kameo315: Making A Control Board for the House Wide, Arduino Controlled Audio System!

I have never had a date, flirted, gone to parties in years, or had a girlfriend. I am very new to socialization and trying to have friends so if my problem seems inane or simple please be understanding. \n\nI want to be with a woman named X, but recently my actions haven't been true to that desire. I met her a semester ago through hearing her sweet voice, she is Chinese and I really enjoyed talking to her because I am learning Chinese and she has a wonderful personality. She actually seems to care about what I think which is incredible for me because when I talk to other people I hear so many only care about talking about themselves, but this information is tangential. The point is that after weekly visits and discussions I believe we developed a fondness for each other even though she is ten years older than me. Which, coupled by the fact that I am a black guy is probably going to be a deterrent in my courtship of her, so I am worried about the stability of her affection towards me.  \nThe problem is that the semester was over and a new one began. I haven't seen her on campus. She is getting her doctorate at the school and works as a teachers assistant so I googled her name and found her place of work and email address. However I think of my actions towards the thought of her is that of simple and what I believe to be self destructive, idolization, not human interaction. This is because I fear real action. I wonder whether the action would be interpreted as creepy or inane. However I decided that either way I should try something. So I emailed her. Like a fool. It was the least action I could take but action none the less I suppose. I wrote to her that I miss talking to her and wanted to hangout again. I am glad I have done something but email has a consequence of not being immediate or extremely accessible communication, as compared to say a call, in day to day life. So I am left with wonder of her response. I feel regret that I haven't done something more human, with more risk and gusto than a simple email. I wish I met her in person. I realize that I have the opportunity to do so. I could come around to her building and walk over to her office and look for her or a fellow co worker but I and ask her or them for her contact information but I am worried that this has gone too far. I am looking at myself under the light of a stalker. A person that has contact information without it been given to me. I fear that my action thus far is creepy and that if I were to try to meet her in person in her place of work I would be even more of a creep. So I want some other opinions. \n\nIs going to her place of work to talk to her about meeting up creepy? Is there another way that I can get into contact that wouldn't be as creepy? Am I a creep for emailing her without her giving me her email address? Please be as brutally honest as possible I need another perspective besides my own.\naustlate: I would say to not contact her in person or by any other means until she responds to your email.  Personally, being ten years older than you, she might see you as a little brother/friend type rather than as a potential romantic partner.  Be prepared for that reality.  Also be prepared for no response.  There's so many creeper guys in the world ruining it for the nice guys, and I don't blame her if she wants to be cautious.  Just wait to see if she responds and don't come on too strong if she does.  Even if she doesn't share your feelings, you could still be friends.\n15jorada: Do you think I should have met her in person before emailing her?\naustlate: I think that would have been ideal, but depending on how close you two were/what you wrote in the email, an email isn't a deal-breaker.  Like if you two were on good terms, I'm sure opening an email from you would be surprising but not unwelcome.  But if she was being nice to you because she's nice to everyone, it might come off creepy.  It really depends.    \n15jorada: Oh man, I feel dumb.

I'm a middling college student, a virgin, and come from a fairly well off background.  I have trouble getting girls to talk to me, or even meeting people(of either sex) in general.  I go for long walks at night, alone, to record my thoughts.  The police said that he was \"Eurasian\"... So am I.  I have some low level fear that if someone hurt me, I could become like him... It is a frightening thought.  To be clear, I haven't read the manifesto, so I only know what the news media is saying.\n\nThat being said.  Once someone convinces themselves that they are going to do this, there is very little way to stop them mid stream.  This sort of thing needs to start young.  IDK if there was an inciting moment early in life, but he should have been examined as soon as symptoms started to appear.  There are tons of small cultural things that I think contribute to this, stuff.\n\nOne thing that frustrates me is that my brain makes everything hurt, but no one, other than my therapist, acknowledges that my pain is real.  They would say things like \"it's all in your head.\"  Well, yes it is, but that doesn't make it hurt less.  I feel like years of people telling me to \"get over\" my pain because it was \"all in my head\" aggravated my condition to where it is now.  I have the opposite problem as Rodgers in this respect.  My entire life, I was told to blame myself, and i still do.  I'm still learning to love the real me, and not blame myself when things get out of hand.  Rodgers felt like everything was someone else's fault.  Might these be opposed reactions to the same stimuli?  idk, but i'd believe it..  \n\nTreating mental illness as an actual disability would be a good start.  That way we can get these people coping mechanisms, support networks, and other things so keep them sane.  Often people get fired from a job for having SA.  So you can't fire a woman for getting pregnant, but you can fire me for having SA?  one of those things is a choice(broadly speaking, I understand that accidents do happen), one is a disease.  I don't think that we should be shamed for a thing that is outside of our control.\n\nI guess I'm talking a bit about myself, but I feel like that is the point.  As much as commentators are trying to make this kid seem like an anomaly, in truth, is is not that different from us.  When I hear how shocked commentators are, I can't help but think that these people have not read Catcher in the Rye, and that frustrates me.  Being lonely has sucked for as long as people have been lonely.\n\nthat was a ramble.  I promise I'm ok... just frustrated.\nazcard: I can relate to a lot of this.

I feel like I've protected it for so long that I don't know who that is anymore. Instead, I continually try to learn more about myself so I can attempt to improve. So I'm fighting on finding who I really am or was - while trying to get better and finding a non depressed, non anxiety me.\n\nHow has therapy worked for you? I plan on starting very soon.\nsuburiboy: When i was young, 11-13 I saw several child psychologists, and hated it.  They would always talk down to me.  I just didn't want to be there and I was not ready for it.  I had a really bad indecent in 8th grade; then I started to see a good psychiatrist for a years, and i credit him with getting me through highschool without falling apart. \n\nRecently I was thrown in jail.  I was being questioned by police and had a panic attack, which they thought was suspicious.  After that, I started seeing a counselor at uni for 3 or 4 months, and she was really helpful.  That was the first time I had heard of SA or GAD or Disthymia, which are things she thought I may have.  (I then got a second opinion and that person wanted to put my on anti depressants immediately.)  The counselor told me that this condition is not my fault, and that I should not be ashamed of it.  I find that this has been a really helpful way to think about it.  I have low self-esteem, so realizing that I didn't need to hate myself when i couldn't do things, actually makes things much easier.  Also just having a person to talk though your problems with is super useful, and makes you feel less lonely.\n\nazcard: Thank you for your response. What's weird is I don't think its completely my fault, but it doesn't make it any easier for me. Saying it a few times in my head is different then somehow fully believing it.\n\nDid the anti depressants work well for you? How often do you take them? I have anxiety even thinking about it because I am very cautious about being addicted to meds.

There are many sides to this story, so finding a way to read the histories written by both sides might be a good way to get started, too.\n\nThe story is complex (note this is not the whole story): In the wake of WWI and the Ottoman Empire there was a general failure to take regions and people into account throughout the entire Middle East when trying to rebuild it, and the area was in general a clusterfuck. There was also in the preceeding 60 years a series of movements mostly by displaced and persecuted Jews to the Palestinian region. Prior to the creation of Isreal, Palestine was under control of the British, not the US or even themselves, and the creation of Israel was timed to be at the end of British rule. There was also the issue of what to do with all the displaced Jews all around the world, where would be the safe place for them to live, and that was something that was talked about within the League of Nations prior to the creation of Israel.\n\nFor your question, you might want to put it into a specific context. Are you wondering whether it moral right now to continue, or was it moral to create it in the first place? You could get answers far ranging, from comparisons to why it is OK for the US to still occupy Native American land or not, to the idea that the League of Nations was just doing its best under the circumstances, and what they hoped was best for all people involved.\nmanolo458: Appreciate the comparison that you made with US occupying Native American land. Gives me something to think about. Thanks man. \n812many: No problem. As a (former) Jew, I've done a lot of thinking about the morality of what's going on in Israel, and would love to debate/read about a debate about it. I personally don't like the US carte blanche approach with Isreal, and I'm also not a fan of the general view by the current Palestinian government (Hamas) that all the Jews should be wiped into the sea. I can see why the Israelis have a hard time negotiating with them, however their approach of trying to build cities and slowly take over Palestinian claimed land (1967 boarders) by having entrenched populations while specifically not negotiating is a really dick move, and only enrages a people who are slowly getting squeezed.\n\nIn the immortal words of Rodney King, \"Can't we all just get along?\"\n\nedit: see, just like talking about it, even though i've gone on my own tangent only partially related to your question :)\n", "prompt": "manolo458: Morality of Israel and Zionism\n\nhowyou_doin: You clearly need to catch up on your history.

It can save your pets life.\n[removed]\nWowSeriously666: Just to piggyback onto what OP has said, there is a old wives tale that some people still believe that if you allow a dog (cat, guinea pig, rabbit, etc.) to get pregnant and have one litter that she will magically settle down and become a more all-around loving pet to the owner. And that it's just cruel to make an animal live it's life without ever knowing the joy of having babies. Because we all know that having and raising children is the most calming, zen thing around without a single complication that could end the mothers life. This is just crazy talk people. Yes, some dogs love being moms but not every animal needs to do it and there is no \"magic\" that turns them into better pets because \"they had their own babies to love\". \n\nSpaying early on while pets are still young can not only prevent a lot of problems including uterine cancer but neutering males young can prevent any prostate problems or even testicular cancer. And in lots of areas there is low cost help, including fixing cats as low as $20 each. \n\nOP, I hope your dog recovers and has a long cancer free life.\nK_J_W: You are so right. Our male dog was aggressive and would run. We were told if you neuter him.. he will stop. It did not. As he ages, he is getting better with being aggressive/reactive and running. He still does stuff that is frustrating out of a game for him. But the neutering wasn't the solve all. \nOur female has sensory issues. If she would have puppies it would have killed her. Mentally and physically.\nWowSeriously666: I feel for you OP and have had similar struggles. I had an adopted beagle as a child that was neutered after he was fully grown and it did nothing to stop him from jumping the fence and running the neighborhood trying to fight every dog in it. I remember I was always on my bike trying to hunt him down. At least we knew he couldn't make any little baby beagles. \n\nMy vet now has always advocated spaying and neutering pets. I ended up adopting my brothers large yellow Lab when he moved to Florida. He was never one to neuter his dogs because apparently neutering a male dog is just too personal for some guys. At least that's what he always said. When the dog was about seven years old he started having health issues. Turned out he was having prostate problems. I was told the first step would be to neuter him which would take care of the testosterone which would hopefully solve the prostate problems, if not more surgery would be needed. Thankfully neutering him solved his prostate issues. \n\nOnce a male dog has gone through puberty and had testosterone surging through his system neutering them really does very little to nothing to change their personality. The same for male cats, once they have the testosterone in their system you can't magically change their personality back to cute kitten-hood by neutering them. that's why they always tell you if you want to prevent spraying you must neuter them early.\nsamking86: I had my dog neutered at around 6 months hoping it would keep him from running off and looking for females. \n\nIt didn't work.\nAromatic-Box-592: Neutering isn\u2019t a magical fix all, neutered male dogs still think intact females smell *really* good (lol) but with training you should be able to stop him!\nsamking86: He has proven me wrong time and time again so now he gets put on his chain unless we are out there with him.

{"full_text": "eaamade: YSK the difference between Type I and Type II diabetes. (X-Post from ELI5)\nI know this is a little different than is intended for this subreddit. However, when people confuse the two it shows ignorance. So, I'm going to try to drop some knowledge on ya!\n\nFirst, you need to know what insulin is. Insulin, released by the pancreas, is the hormone the body uses to take sugar out of the blood (where it is transported) and into cells that need it. This is usually skeletal muscle cells - so your muscles. Most things that you eat are converted into glucose (sugar) for use the body. Sweet foods, Carbohydrates, protein (sometimes), etc.\n\n\nSo there are three different types of diabetes. Type I, Type II, and gestational. Ill be focusing on the first two. The word \"diabetes\" comes from Greek, and it literally means excessive discharge of urine. This is one of the symptoms of diabetes. The excess urination (polyuria) is due to high sugar levels in the blood. High sugar is actually toxic to the individual, so the body - specifically kidneys- attempts to rid the elevated glucose levels, and its end product is urination. Other symptoms are excessive hunger (polyphagia) and excessive thirst (polydipsia). Weight loss is accompanied with these symptoms.\n\n\nOkay, so Type I Diabetes. Type I diabetes is caused by the pancreas not producing insulin. In a normal individual, the pancreas is tasked with insulin production. More specifically, the Islet Cells of the pancreas. In this type of diabetes, the immune systems screws up and starts producing antibodies against the Islet Cells of the pancreas which in turn signals the immune system to attack and destroy these cells. With the destruction of these cells, the body no longer has a way of producing insulin, this causes elevated blood sugar levels. What causes Type I diabetes, is not fully known. Speculation includes a virus infection, some genetics, and so forth. There is no cure for Type I. Those who suffer this chronic disease (chronic - meaning lifelong) are required to inject themselves with insulin to deal with elevated sugar levels.\n\nTwo types of complications with Type I diabetes. Short term, and long term. I will go over short term only for this part.\n\nShort term - meaning that not care is taken (no insulin is administered). Ketoacidosis. This occurs with elevated blood sugar levels. When your blood sugar is high, your body thinks it is starving. So, it starts to break down fat, and some muscle. The breakdown of fat is normal, however in Type I diabetics in ketoacidosis is occurs at such a high rate, that it lowers the pH of the blood (body?). Life can only be sustained at a pH of between 7.3-7.4. So unless the individual is taken to the hospital, they cannot survive.\n\nHypoglycemia - when taking insulin (called exogenous insulin) there is always the risk of taking too much. When an individual takes too much, there blood sugar may drop too low. Below 60 is dangerous to a diabetic type I, because the brain relies on blood sugar to survive. Usually when it gets below 70 the individual will feel a strong, strong hunger, as well as begin to shake. At this point they should have some fast acting sugar (coke, juice, water w/ sugar mixed). If it gets below 40 or 50, the person will go into coma and death or brain damage occurs.\nType I diabetics don't usually have dietary restrictions. They just have to maintain good blood sugar levels via insulin injections.\n\n\nOKAY, now type II diabetes. Way more common. About 95% of Diabetics are Type II\n\nThis one is caused by insulin resistance. So, this means that the body is producing insulin just as normal, however the muscles (which respond to insulin) are not responding to it - either at all or not as normal.\nThere are a number of causes for this type of diabetes. It does have some genetic dispositions to it. E.g. Native Americans and African Americans are more prone to it. But it also has a big deal to do with your diet. Obesity is a huge indicator of Type II diabetes.\n\nSo, because the body is not responding to insulin (which is produced in the pancreas) as it should. This causes an elevated blood sugar level. However ketoacidosis is not very common in Type II diabetics. This is due to the fact that insulin is still being produced, so blood sugar levels do not rise that high.\n\nTreatment for Type II diabetes is by a dietary change, exercise, oral pills, and for really late cases insulin.\n\nType II can be reversible. With proper exercise, and diet change, it is possible to reverse it. However, this is easier said than done. Many people who are diagnosed with Type II, receive it later on in life. At this point the person already has their eating habits and diet (lack of) set. To expect to change someones habit, even with a diagnosis of a chronic disease, is still very difficult.\n\nThis is when pills come into play. The medication, usually metformin (sp?), allows for an increase in sensitivity of insulin. This helps in lowering blood sugar. However, and this cannot be stressed enough, diet and exercise are crucial for type II diabetics control.\n\n------\nOkay now the long term complications, for both Type I and Type II diabetes\n\nElevated blood sugar levels are toxic to the body. So when you leave them high for extended periods of time, you may deal with the following.\nBlindness\nHeat Disease (including heart attack and disease of arteries)\nGangrene \nBacterial Infections \nperiodontitis - receding gum line\nAnd oh so many more.\n------\n\nTL;DR - Type I and Type II diabetes are two separate disease with different methods of treatments. They share in that in both conditions, elevated blood sugar levels exist.\n-------\nIf there are any errors in this, I apologize. Please, just let me know. Thanks\n\nEDIT1 - I just copied and pasted this from the ELI5 subreddit. I don't know why some of the text is formatted in blue?\nDaniVendetta: This was very informative, thank you. One of my very good friends has Type I diabetes and I've always wondered what the difference was. \n\nNow, I've read somewhere that if a diabetic goes into those hunger shakes, to put a sugar packet on their gums. Is this right? Because I've also heard if they're not hypoglycemic it can kill them? So what is the proper thing to do if, say you're at a restaurant and someone is on a first date and goes into those shakes and the other person has no idea what to do? Obviously call 911, but what should you do for the short term to avoid a coma?\neaamade: You're welcome!\n\nI've never heard of putting a sugar packet in their gums.  In my opinion (I'm not a doctor), I wouldn't try to place any object in their mouth.\n\nHowever, if someone is hypoglycemic (hunger shakes) you should provide for them high sugar liquid item.  Coke (not diet coke), juice, even water with sugar mixed. \n\nIt is important to note that they should be able to drink it themselves.  If they are not able to do it, don't give them anything.  Call 911 instead.  The reason for this is that if they are unable to drink it themselves, it usually means they will not be able to swallow it which can causes choking.\n\n\nIf someone is not hypoglycemic and they are provided with sugar, it will not kill them.  This is unless it is high for a long period of time.  The better of two evils is to have a little high blood sugar than a little low.\n", "prompt": "eaamade: YSK the difference between Type I and Type II diabetes.

I've always wondered if there are places that just see them as two variations of the same thing. \nPelusteriano: Here in Mexico we mostly use green sour lemons, [they look like this](https://www.google.com.mx/search?safe=off&amp;es_sm=122&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=809&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=green+lemon&amp;revid=1226258659&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q1QIoAGoVChMI7vvr_ZfpxgIVyZuICh2HPwCt&amp;dpr=1), it's very rare to see anyone using [yellow sweet lemons](https://www.google.com.mx/search?q=lemon&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIqpSE_JfpxgIVVi2ICh2P1wTb&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=809). They're actually variations of the same thing, the same plant domesticated to obtain different characteristics, just like all dogs -chihuahuas, huskies, labs, etc.- are *Canis lupus familiaris*, both sweet and sour lemons are different types of *Citrus lemon*.\n\nIn Mexico we call [these ones](http://www.viveroyautepec.com.mx/citricos/lima-mexicana.jpg) lime. They have a delicate sweet flavour. I'm not entirely sure to which extent this applies to Mexico-USA border, but in the portion from Mesoamerica to South America this is what I'm aware is the regular thing.\nlagoon83: Fascinating stuff! Here (in the UK), in my experience at least, yellow lemons are renowned for being incredibly bitter - I don't think we'd ever refer to them as being sweet! Probably says something about our diet, though... \n\nInterestingly, I'd always thought the green sour lemons were what we'd call limes... but now I'm not so sure! I've definitely seen them sold as limes in supermarkets - they're smaller, darker and more round than the limes you linked to. I'm gonna have to investigate this further :) \n\nThanks for the info, though - really interesting!\nPelusteriano: I always get confused with this! I'm not really sure how the words got all mixed up, though.\nlagoon83: Weird, isn't it? Happens in loads of languages though! When I was in my teens I was a total language geek (I was fluent in three, and had a decent knowledge of three more) and stuff like this was always a nightmare. There'd be one word that had completely different meanings in multiple languages!\n\nFound [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend) that goes into it in more detail, because that's what Monday mornings are all about :)\nMadameK14: May I ask which languages ? :) I'm a language geek myself! \nlagoon83: I spoke French, German and English fluently, and dabbled in Russian, Spanish and Italian.

My max regular push ups are about 30. What's the best way to train for one arm? Negatives/knee OAPU's/archer push ups/uneven? How to include them in RR? What rep ranges should I use?\ntykato: I've never trained for the OAPU specifically, yet can do it. Here's how:\n\nI did the basic pattern (normal push up with good form) with added weight. I did 5x5 every other day with focus on good form. Every week, i increased the weight by about 2.5kg/5lbs.\n\nAfter adding about +30% bodyweight, i could do archers, and at about +60% bodyweight, i could do my first one arm.\n\nA good way to add the weight could be a weight vest, books/stuff in a backpack, or even just another person that would push you down slightly (though the resistence is hard to track).\n\nThere are plenty of other ways to achieve the OAPU. This is just my own way, which worked for me.\nPewoos: Thanks for the advice. Btw, how did you add +60% bw? I don't see myself putting 40 kg in a backpack lol. \ntykato: You're welcome! After a certain weight, just use people.

They threaten to stop supporting analog.  I am fairly certain that my dad is refusing out of sheer stubbornness because he doesn\u2019t want to be forced. I applaud the conviction!\nLiberty_Call: That same blind stubbornness is running our country right now.\n\nIt is really not something to be applauded.\ncoco_css: Not the same thing at all actually, but thanks for your input.\nLiberty_Call: He is insisting on doing something just because it is what he decided to do.\n\nIt does not matter to him that the newer technology is better, more reliable, cheaper to maintain, and safer.\n\nHe is going to do what he wants with no regard to the fact that he is slowing progress or that what he is demanding is making things worse for every party involved.\n\nSeems pretty similar to me.\ncoco_css: Verizon has told them that they will not provide any support for his phone and they are able to cut off analog at any point. He is aware of this, knows he will have to go digital at that point, and is fine with it when the time comes.\n\nThe thing he has a problem with is that he paid for something he planned to use until it no longer works (like he does with everything, as he is not a wasteful person) and the company he purchased it from and has a contract with is trying to force him to pay more money, not only for a new phone but also a drastically higher bill every month. \n\nHe is not slowing progress or demanding things are worse for everyone else. He has no control over when Verizon decides to stop supporting analog phones.\n\nFor the record, since you are trying to make this political he falls on the opposite side of the aisle that you assume he is on.\nLiberty_Call: &gt;The thing he has a problem with is that00 he paid for something he planned to use until it no longer works \n\nWe can plan whatever we want, like the president planned to just do whatever he wanted in office. We live in the real world though. Clinging to legacy technology for stubborn personal reasons slows down progress selfishly as they end up having to maintain old equipment.\n\n&gt;For the record, since you are trying to make this political he falls on the opposite side of the aisle that you assume he is on.\n\nWhat does that have to do with anything? His behavior is not acceptable because his political spirit animal is a donkey instead of an elephant.\n\nBeing stubborn for the sake of being stubborn is not admirable.\ncoco_css: You are never going to agree with me and that is fine. I am simply saying he is not holding anything up. He has no power over when Verizon decides to make his tech obsolete. He does have a choice of riding it out until that point, and it has no bearing on the speed in which Verizon stops supporting analog. He is allowed to choose as long as he is given the choice. He doesn\u2019t have to switch because Verizon asked him to. \n\nI only mentioned politics because you were equating him with our government, which makes it political. This is not political, it is a cell phone. \n\nThis entire debate is ridiculous and I wouldn\u2019t give a shit, but it is my dad and you are acting like he is ruining the world and somehow selfish because he wants to keep his cell phone.\nLiberty_Call: I am acting like stubbornness is not something to be admired and using examples as to why.\n\nSticking to ones guns when there are obvious better solutions for everyone involved just because is stubborn and ignorant.\ncoco_css: But you are acting like him wanting to keep his phone makes everyone have to have outdated technology and that is not the case. Amazingly enough, he does not choose how the cellular market runs for the rest of the world. Yes, I said stubborn in my original remark. Wasn\u2019t aware this was going to turn into a deposition and also apparently an attack on my father\u2019s character. What you are describing sounds like everyone needs to just go along with whatever a giant company says which likely benefits no one but their bottom line. Somehow it is better in your opinion that everyone bends to what Verizon wants than for my dad to be able to choose to keep his current service as long as it is offered.  I would appreciate you not calling him ignorant as you have absolutely no idea who he is. You sir are the ignorant one.\n\nGood day.\nLiberty_Call: The logic behind the stubbornness is the issue, not just the impact it has. If he is this stubborn in a situation where things will only improve by changing his mind, imagine how many situations are made worse by such stubborness.\n\nAnd again, stubbornness for the sake of stubbornness is not to be admired.\ncoco_css: \u201cIf he is this stubborn in a situation where things will only improve by changing his mind, imagine how many situations are made worse by such stubborness.\u201d\n\nYou are assuming his decision is impeding improvement or making the situation worse. This is false.\n\nI SAID GOOD DAY\nLiberty_Call: It is the worse decision.\n\nIt is inferior technology with lower sound quality, less coverage nation wide, puts out more radiation, etc.\n\nThings would be better by switching, but stubbornessnis stopping him. If things would be better by switching, refusing to switch is impeding improvement.\ncoco_css: If he chooses a worse decision for himself, is that not his choice? He is not affecting anyone else. I am touched that you are so worried about his sound quality though.\nLiberty_Call: The point is that you think that such a decision making process that leaves people worse off than if they made better decisions is admirable.\n\nWhy is unnecessarily choosing the worse choice out of stubbornness admirable?\ncoco_css: What is admirable is that he is making his own choices and not just doing what they prefer he do. I was also saying these things in jest and wasn\u2019t making some serious stance...until you decided to attack for absolutely no reason.\n\nThe best decision for him right now is to stick with the lower bill for a phone he only uses for emergencies. You keep saying what the best decision is, but you don\u2019t have a horse in this race. This has nothing to do with you or anyone else. His choice is not adversely affecting anyone.\nLiberty_Call: &gt;What is admirable is that he is making his own choices and not just doing what they prefer he do.\n\nAnd this is what I disagree with. Stubbornness for the sake of stubbornness when it makes/keeps things worse than they could be by appraoching with an open mind is not something to be admired.\n\nStubbornness for the sake of stubbornness has caused a whole lot of unnecessary suffering in the world.\ncoco_css: I would hope that we can agree that my father\u2019s choice in cell phone is not causing any suffering in the world. This is false equivalence. The only reason I am still responding is you attacked his character and called him ignorant. Those are assumptions you have made and assumptions are extremely dangerous. I can assure you that he would not stubbornly or selfishly do something that would harm others or the state of the world and I would hope you would take my word on that.\n\nSource: have been daughter for nearly 38 years. Have seen him at his best and his worst. Know who he is.\nLiberty_Call: All I am assuming is that he has poor decision making processes based on stubbornness according to you.\n\nAnd that for some reason you value contrarian stubbornness for the sake of being stubborn.\ncoco_css: You\u2019re right. That is exactly what I said. /s\nLiberty_Call: Pretty much.\n\n&gt; I am fairly certain that my dad is refusing out of sheer stubbornness because he doesn\u2019t want to be forced.

Some participants sharing information which vendors are offering bad quality products are pretty much geez important to markets\nshinola80: If that we\u2019re the definition of cancel culture, I would agree. Sharing knowledge about the products or services which people have the liberty to purchase is one thing. However, using selective quotes with no regard to context, or framing perceived faults in a way that prevents the producer of a good or service to present themselves fairly in the market, are tools of cancel culture which destroy the market in favor of bullying all perceived non-compliant members out of contention. \n\nThe problem with cancel culture is that a sufficiently vocal group of self-identified victims can find any pretense on which to cancel those with whom they disagree politically, not necessarily those who are morally wrong.\nKraftySOT: But from what are you actually \"cancelled\"?\n\nBeing cancelled from life, is murder, and we have laws against that. Being cancelled from Youtube or Twitter, isnt really being cancelled, unless you think that the blogosphere or social media IS the world.\n\nTake Milo for instance. Pretty sure he was cancelled. He lost his speaking tour at colleges, he lost his job at Breitbart, he was banned from Twitter. He still has a youtube channel, he can still get on the internet, still publishes books, and can rent out any hotel conference room that will have him so he can still communicate with other people.\n\nHe can even talk to people in the streets.\n\nBeing removed from a platform doesnt mean you are cancelled, it just means you're not allowed back on someone elses property.\n\nIf I ban you from my house because I dont like you, you dont cease to exist. You arent silenced. You arent actually losing anything but the ability to be at my house.\n\nUnless you're suggesting that people should be allowed to do whatever they want on someone elses property, I dont see where the \"cancel culture is bad\" argument takes off.\n\nI think its stupid too, hell even Noam Chomsky thinks cancel culture is stupid, but the disproportionate reaction people have to it is really overblown imho. Oh no, you got kicked out of Wendys because they didnt like you.\n\nGo to Mickey Ds. Who cares.\n\nIf someone is being deprived of civil rights or their life, thats egregious, but theres avenues for redressing those grievances already.  \n\n\nI think the issue here is that people thought, incorrectly, that you can use someone elses platform to boost the strength of your idea in the market place of ideas, and when that platform was ripped out from beneath them, they got mad, instead of simply getting their own platform, or going to another platform.  \n\n\nI think MOST of the anti cancel culture people, just had this really wrong idea that they could stand on someone elses chair to participate in a discussion, and got super Karen about being pushed off that chair.  \n\n\nIt aint your chair. Never was.\nshinola80: That is the exact argument made for segregation.  \u201cSo what if you can\u2019t eat at this diner if they don\u2019t like you?

They don\u2019t act based on the actual market.\n\nso what?  \n\n\nwhat exactly is the problem? if a business decides that serving racists costs to much business from non-racists and bans racists then that business has literally followed the market.  \n\n\nsame with business deciding to serve LGBTI community, they realised that they would gain more money by switching from religious conservatives to the LGBTI groups.  \n\n\nthis is all by definition the market in action.\nKraftySOT: And that hand aint invisible either. You can literally watch it happen.  \n\n\nI really, really dont care if some jerk in smalltown Alabama doesnt serve Jews. I wasnt going to go there anyways.   \n\n\nIf Netflix came out tomorrow and went full Nick Cannon, I'd cancel my subscription. Easy as that.  \n\n\nNow if im barred from a public park, public service, or treated differently by the law and its enforcers because of my 'brewnish. Well, then we have a completely different subject to talk about, and im not going to convey my argument with a strongly worded letter to the newspaper. Its full Warsaw up in here then.   \n\n\nCivil discourse and voting with your hard earned dollar, is a sight better than calling in the national guard....or going Full Warsaw.\nshinola80: You have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.  If a diner refuses to serve Jews, that is a violation of their rights, and that was determined over 60 years ago. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t conflate your right as an individual not to patronize an establishment with the active attempt to shut down an establishment based on unproven or out-of-context accusations from interest groups. Those are two completely different things, and the effort to confuse the two is wildly dishonest and a very cheap tactic.\nKraftySOT: Its not a violation of my rights not to serve me because I'm Jewish. At least, I dont feel violated, as a Jewish person.\n\nBar me from a library, employment, running for office, joining the military, going to school, getting medical care, owning a home, or getting a lawyer and a fair trial....well, as said....then its full Warsaw Uprising.\n\nIm a bartender. If I dont want to serve you because you're a goy, I dont have too, and I wont. I refuse service to people all the time, for a litany of reasons. You dont have the right to force me to serve you. You dont have a right to cover Skrewdriver songs on my stage either.\n\nYou're free to take that to Twitter, Yelp, or scream it from the park across the street from my bar.\n\nPut it in whatever context you want.\n\nI've been accused of being racist because I have a painting an artist did at a showcase we hosted of Mussolini doing a kickflip on a skateboard. To me, it makes fun of fascism by showing one of its creators doing something silly. To others its apparently a symbol of my white nationalism. It doesnt matter how many times I tell these people im Jewish, they dont care. Which is fine, thats their right. Cancel me. Knock yourself out.\n\nMeanwhile one of the spoken word artists we host is a member of the Nation of Islam.\n\nWe get along great. He knows full well im Jewish. We discuss things and argue. I drink IPAs, he drinks soda water. I eat hotdogs, he eats boiled peanuts. I go to the BLM protests in my city, he goes to a Mosque and prays about it. MF Doom and other 5%er hip hop is our starting  connection, which blossomed into a friendship.\n\nUnlike many other people around me, I am not bothered by being falsely labeled. I dont mind having a friendship with someone who is diametrically opposed to everything I am.\n\nApparently my life is dishonest and a cheap tactic.\n\nThats ok, I dont hold that against you. Its your right to believe that.\nshinola80: A LOT of legislation stating with the CRA of -964 days that if you discriminate against a customer based on race, disability, national origin, or religion, you actually are violating those individuals\u2019 rights.

Was this poor advice on her part?\n\nIs there any chance that my homeowners would even consider covering this?\n\nLastly, this house was \"flipped\" by the previous owner, this room was painted, and in staging a mirror covered this spot on the wall that started the concern. There was no mold warnings in the disclosure, and I feel like the seller went out of their way to cover up this particular issue. Is there any actions I can take against the seller for this. I don't want to be an asshole, and sue them for everything they have, I just want the issue fixed. If my homeowners covers it, I'll pay the $1000 deductible and move on with life. \n\nIf I end up totally screwed monetarily, what would be my best option for handling such a job with limited funds? \nZiczak: If you're dealing with a house flipper and suspect they knowingly covered up a mold issue, stop contact the real estate office and an attorney.\n\nGet some 3 mill plastic sheets and duct tape and seal off the area. Since there's a chimney there, it's likely the water came from somewhere in there, from the roof.\n\nThe solution is stop the moisture problem then gut the wall.\n[deleted]: This times a million.\n\nOP, this flipper seems to have covered this up. While we cannot say that for certain, I think it's pretty obviously suspect. \n\nStop work immediately, seal everything off ASAP. I suggest staying somewhere else if possible for now. You don't want to be breathing in mold, period. \n\nContact your lawyer before contacting the real estate office. Make certain that you know what next steps you're going to need to take.\n\nIt's going to be an expensive removal job, but not one you should have to pay for yourself.\niROFLd: Thanks! I'll be contacting MY realtor in the morning, as well as finding a lawyer. \n\nI did speak briefly my realtor today and he seems to think it would be hard to prove the seller knew about the mold. \n\nYes the chimney was actually a pain point in contract. There were cracks around the sides in the stucco and the cap had a chunk out of it. FHA refused to fund our loan until it was fixed. Seller agreed, new cap as put on and stucco 'repaired' though looking at it now its already cracking again. Kinda curious why the FHA appraiser took 4 days to verify the fixes and miss something like this. Not to mention we had an inspection (obviously didn't check for mold). Flipper did a fantastic job of covering it up. \nfreeboater: Did you not use a lawyer for closing. May differ where you are, but where I live, you need a lawyer (realistically) for closing.\n\nYou definitely want to contact a lawyer, but hold back in taking any definitive action. You're in cost containment mode; see what the lawyer can do in terms of sending the seller a letter. More often in these cases, suing is the best way to lose money. Threatening to sue may get you the same result, with way less spent.\n\nSee if you can find someone to do an estimate, preferrably free. They'll give you the best sense of what you're in for.\n\nGood luck, that sucks.\niROFLd: No I did not. My best friend is a corp lawyer for NetJets and he actually was the one who told me I wouldn't need one since there was nothing crazy in the contract besides closing costs. He's out of the country for another week or I would be asking his these questions, rather than pestering you guys. \n\nLike I said in the beginning, all I want is what I paid for, nothing more, I've done pretty well thus far in life with the idea that if you're generally nice, fair, and respectful to people, they will generally reciprocate.

I have a Aquos that has it. It does exactly shit. My old receiver doesn't have the option. Saying most receivers and TVs have good options to compress audio is complete bullshit. \nOwyn_Merrilin: What receiver doesn't have it? It's been a standard feature at least since the Dolby Digital spec was finalized back in the mid 90's.\nTrailRatedRN: My home theater is 5.1 klipsch speakers with a Yamaha receiver. Dolby digital. We almost always have our Blu-ray Discs play with quiet vocals and loud music. Where is this option to adjust this problem? We have it connected hdmi and set to 'straight' to recognize the Blu-ray Disc setting.\nOwyn_Merrilin: Yamaha has it under the settings menu instead of on a dedicated button. On my receiver (Yamaha RX-V367), it's setup-&gt;Sound Setup, and then there's actually two menus under that that adjust it in two different ways. One under \"adaptive DRC,\" with settings for off and auto (I'm not quite sure what the difference between this and the regular dynamic range setting is, since I don't use compression myself), and one under D. Range, with settings for Max (no compression, full range between loudest and quietest sounds as recorded on the disc), STD (\"standard,\" moderate compression), and Min, (minimum dynamic range, least difference between loudest and quietest sounds).\n\nThe better fix if you haven't done it, though, would be to make sure you've properly calibrated your system first, using the YPAO auto setup and the microphone that came with the receiver (if your system has that feature), or an SPL meter and the test tones in the speaker settings menu (if it doesn't have YPAO). This won't actually change the dynamic range, but it will make sure that all of the speakers are outputting sound at the correct volume. This is good because more often than not, the center speaker needs a little bit of a boost and the surrounds and mains need to be turned down a little bit, which makes the difference between dialog (which is almost entirely played back by the center speaker) and sound effects (which are mostly on the other four) even bigger than the already large range that the sound engineers intended. If you didn't do this when you set up your system, do it before you fiddle with the dynamic range settings. Even if you find that the full range is too much for, say, listening at night with a baby sleeping in the next room, the system will sound better calibrated and compressed than just compressed.\n\nEdit: After some googling, it looks like the adaptive DRC setting changes the dynamic range automatically based on your main volume setting, with more compression kicking in the lower you set the volume.\nTrailRatedRN: The DRC is set on auto. Is this appropriate? We attempt to set everything to straight to allow the disc to play uncompressed. I don't remember seeing the second setting, but I expect we probably have it set to no compression. I will look for it. We have used the microphone to auto calibrate the speakers. However, we've found that after its use, the sub sounds waay too loud and we manually turned it down. Does this seem common? One more question: when I first got this, I remember reading somewhere that once the speakers were calibrated, optimum listening volume would be 0. We usually need to set the receiver to -27 when we watch movies. Is this a sign of inappropriate set up?\nOwyn_Merrilin: Setting the volume to 0 on a properly calibrated receiver allows you to hear the audio at the exact levels it was recorded by the mixing engineer at the studio, the levels they intended it to be played back at in a theater. I can't personally speak to the situation with the sub (even if I knew enough about YPAO to tell you how often it needed adjustment, bass is weird. It could be anything from the sub being too loud to the physical shape of your room causing it to be louder in some spots than others), but if you insist on turning the master volume down and have a hard time finding a point where the dialog is loud enough and the sound effects are quiet enough, having the adaptive DRC set to auto would help. The whole idea behind it is that when you set your receiver to 0, youll get the full dynamic range, but if you're trying to listen quietly, setting it for the dialog to be reasonable doesn't result in the explosions waking the neighbors.\n\nIf the Adaptive DRC still isn't compressing it enough for you, you could try adjusting the Dynamic Range setting manually, but those dynamics are there for a reason -- your movies and especially music will be less involving with more compression. If you're in a situation where you can do it without getting noise complaints, I'd recommend at least once trying to watch a whole movie with the volume set to 0, the Adaptive DRC off, and the Dynamic Range setting on Max. You might be surprised at how much of a difference it makes in getting sucked in to the movie.\nTrailRatedRN: If we set the volume to 0, you would be holding your ears and we would have to shout to hear each other over the movie. I will play with the settings some. Thanks for the advice. If I fuck it up too much, there's always reset. Lol\nOwyn_Merrilin: Well, the not being able to talk over the movie part is intentional :P\n\nIf it's actually loud enough that it's causing pain, something's not right (room acoustics may be the big problem -- you could have certain sounds reinforcing themselves and getting to uncomfortable levels in ways the auto setup didn't pick up), but if it's just *loud*, again, that's intentional :P\n\nAnyway, good luck with the tweaking. Like you said, if you fuck it up too much, you can always reset it.

{"full_text": "ElderTheElder: IKEA Couch Support Beam Issue (Question + Pics)\n**UPDATE** Thanks to all of your input, I decided to give it a shot myself. I had to disassemble the couch, remove many of the springs below, and brute force that shit into place with the help of some rage screams (because I have little to no spare tools/ wood in this apartment). I may or may not have gotten a hernia but the couch is now as the Swedish furniture gods had originally intended. IKEA customer service can go blow itself; thanks for the help /r/DIY!\n\n&gt;Before I begin, please understand that I have little to no furniture repair/ woodwork experience and may not use correct terminology. For that I apologize:\n\n&gt;I recently purchased this IKEA couch as a surprise Christmas gift while my girlfriend was out of town. It was the last one at any IKEA location for miles (discontinued model) and I was excited to get it home and put it together. I live in NYC, so you may understand why this in and of itself was no easy task, but after many hours and called-in favors I was able to get it back to my apartment and up my tiny 4th-floor walkup.\n\n&gt;I took it out of the box and noticed [a problem with the pre-assembled frame.](http://imgur.com/a/PY3um) The photos do their best to tell the story, but basically the black support beam on the left does not fit into the frame as it was meant to. What should have been a pre-assembled part was actually left unscrewed and unmounted from the frame (screwed in at the top and left loose at bottom). Closer inspection showed that the black beam was identical in size to the properly-mounted one next to it, but that the wood frame at bottom was uneven, widening slightly as it got closer to the non-fitting piece and rendering it unmountable. The unmounted part of the beam is toward the back of the couch where the cushions are when fully assembled.\n\n&gt;I've been fighting with customer service for the past week about this. I can't just toss the sofa into my non-existent car and drive down to the store to have them take a look at it\u2013 like I had mentioned even getting this thing *from* IKEA was a logistical nightmare. Because it's a discontinued model, that would only result in them giving me a refund and leaving me sofa-less to start this whole process back up again. Essentially, IKEA is useless to me at this point. I love the sofa and want to keep it if at all possible (I have 90 days to decide whether or not this is feasible). That said, two questions:\n\n&gt;\u2013 How structurally sound is it to have that beam resting atop the wooden frame rather than mounted and screwed into it? Is it still doing the same to support the weight or is it putting focused pressure on that part of the frame that may result in a crack?\n\n&gt;\u2013 If it were cost-efficient (~$20\u201340?) I would just purchase a custom-sized curved black support beam and install it myself, but try as I might I can't even figure out what the proper word for that thing is or where I would go about finding one.\n\n&gt;Any advice would be massively appreciated.\n\n\nHugeSaladFork: Like others have said, it seems trivial to force that beam into place.  It looks to me like it slipped out and the tension from the springs pulled the frame together.\nElderTheElder: That...makes a lot of sense. I hadn't thought of that. Come to think, I *did* find a cut-off screw head in the box. Must have slipped out. So you're saying it can probably be fixed pretty easily?\nHugeSaladFork: &gt;So you're saying it can probably be fixed pretty easily?\n\nYeah, I would say so.  Screw head you say?  I can't tell from the pics but perhaps there is a screw hole on the top of that bracket.  I would try to force the beam into place and put a new screw in that hole if so.  Looks like there is enough flex in that fabric to get a shorty screwdriver in there.  \nElderTheElder: There sure was a hole there; good call. I figured it was a pre-drilled hole but it makes more sense now that perhaps it was already screwed in and the shitty IKEA screw snapped with too much pressure.\n\n/r/DIY saves the day!\nHugeSaladFork: Glad to help!\n", "prompt": "ElderTheElder: IKEA Couch Support Beam Issue (Question + Pics)\n**UPDATE** Thanks to all of your input, I decided to give it a shot myself.

{"full_text": "Csehaka27: YSK: HIV can show no physical symptoms for years and still be present... the best time to get an HIV test is the moment you think you've been exposed to it\nNurse here. You'd be surprised how many people unfortunately don't realize they're a carrier of HIV simply because they \"don't feel sick\". A big reason this virus spreads is because people have no idea they're carriers, even if they know they've had sex with someone who is HIV positive before.\n\nIf you think there's a chance you've been exposed to HIV, please, go get blood work done. The stigma of having the test is no longer an issue and there is a strong argument that anybody who has had unprotected sex should be tested, as the number of positive heterosexuals is now higher (in the UK) than homosexuals. ([source &amp; more information](https://www.medichecks.com/blog/post/When-to-Get-Tested-for-HIV:-Risks-and-Symptoms_62/))\n\nedit: \"You should get tested immediately but a negative test shorty after exposure doesn't mean you aren't HIV positive. You should get tester 3-6 months after that too.\" thanks /u/girlindie\nbradtwo: I've been told by multiple doctors that the tests are more accurate 6 months post possible exposure. \n\nAnyways, you should be getting tested regularly with each new partner. \nfroibo: That seems excessive. How about use a damn condom if you are having sex with strangers? \nGSpess: Because a Condom isn't 100% and knowing your sexual health is something everybody should be on top of. What an idea is that! \n\nYou're being pretty dense about things, honestly. There's no harm in any of this, and more harm in not knowing.\nfroibo: No doctor would ever recommend a test after every partner. He would sooner label you a hypochondriac. He would tell you exactly what I said, use protection. \nherman_gill: It's literally standard of care to recommend someone get tested after any new partner, especially if they're engaging in high risk sexual behaviours (inconsistent condom use, multiple sexual partners within the past 6 months, men who have sex with men, if you have unprotected sex with someone with multiple sexual partners, a bunch of other stuff).\n\nThe benefits to getting early testing done and finding any STD *greatly* outweigh the costs. It's a lot cheaper to give 100 people antibiotics for $10 for treating chlamydia/gonorrhea than having to admit a single person for an inpatient stay for pelvic inflammatory disease. It's cheaper to give someone newly infected with HIV with a normal CD400 HAART therapy than give the 3 or 4 people they might end up infecting before they get tested the same treatment, or for treating long term complications of chronic (or even acute) HIV infection.\nfroibo: No, it is standard practice to get tested in instance of every new partner of unsafe sex. Hence, use a damn condom.\n\nOtherwise you can get tested on schedule.\nherman_gill: The majority of people who engage in safe sexual practices still don't use condoms/dental dams when having oral sex, and several sexually transmittable diseases are transmitted through oral contact.\n\nThe two most common STDs (that we regularly check for, because toxoplasma, mycoplasma genitalium, EBV, CMV, HPV and even HSV1 aren't regularly tested for) are chlamydia and gonorrhea. While chlamydia is generally self resolving in the oral cavity, gonorrhea isn't and can be completely assymptomatic and is very easily transmitted through oral sex.\n\nThose other ones (other than mycoplasma, which we simply don't know enough about yet in the medical community, and was only recently added to the WHOs watchout list for STDs, and we don't have adequate and widespread testing facilities for it yet because NAAT mycoplasma testing is only available at certain sites) aren't tested for specifically *because* they are so common, and some of them even most medical professionals (outside of infectious disease specialists) don't really even consider STDs (obviously HPV and HSV are still thought of).\n\nSo unless you're using a condom and/or dental dam for oral sex, it's still prudent to get tested with every new sexual partner.\nfroibo: That was as very long post describing the lack of danger to cold sores.  \n\nDidn't realize how many alarmists were out there. Better get checked every month even if you are married. Never know if your partner is cheating on you with unsafe sex and wouldn't tell you if they contacted HIV. \nherman_gill: 40% of people in relationships have admitted to having cheated on a partner in the past, so that's actually a real concern.\n\nG/C can cause a ton of problems, condoms aren't 100% effective (and many women are on birth control and people in relationships often don't regularly use condoms).\n\nHSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause very serious complications, particularly in the offspring of mothers who have either and don't have them medically treated, but also plenty of problems in regular people too. It's also a healthcare cost that can be prevented, simply by regularly testing and preventing spread.\n\nM. Genitalium can cause PID, G/C when untreated can cause a host of chronic problems in people (PID, reiter's/reactive arthritis, infertility) the same is true of syphilis (one I forgot to mention, also commonly transmitted through the oral cavity).\n\nPerhaps you're hypervigilant in using condoms, or have never had sex, but that's not the case in most of the real world. Something like 10-15% of people (higher in certain populations/inner city) have an STI (not including the super common ones we don't test, like HPV which 90%+ of sexually active people will get in their life), most are assymptomatic, and over 75% of them *don't know they have an STI*.\n\nYou don't happen to work in healthcare either, do you? Because I do.\nfroibo: Look, I can agree that people need to test more regularly, but this is bordering on paranoia.\n\nAnd you got me. I am a virgin. Sick burn.\nherman_gill: It's a cost effective strategy to prevent the spread of disease in the real world. Condom use is a great idea, but it's often impractical and people don't do it.\n\nYou can tell everyone in the world that using drugs (alcohol/tobacco included) is bad for you, but people are still gonna do it. You need to accommodate to things people are actually willing to do and are convenient for them. That often means harm reduction.\n\nIt's not paranoia if depending on where you live or your age group (college aged people), 25% of people have an STD and most of them don't know about it.\nfroibo: ...Condoms are impractical, but testing isn't? Holy fuck what did I get myself into?\nherman_gill: The real world. Welcome to it.\n\nGetting tested with a new partner = once, the average male will have ~7-8 lifetime partners, and the average woman about 4-5.\n\nEnsuring every single time you're having sex that you have a well fitting condom (that wasn't sitting in your wallet for hours warming and degrading), that it doesn't break, and a bunch of other factors = more tough.\n\nIt's the same reason an IUD for the prevention of pregnancy is often more practical and efficacious than daily birth control, which women often miss.\n", "prompt": "Csehaka27: YSK: HIV can show no physical symptoms for years and still be present... the best time to get an HIV test is the moment you think you've been exposed to it\nNurse here.

He was a salesmen that either was naive or wilfully ignorant, either way he still doesn't get a pass on it.\ntevinodevost: He also made the claims because conservative *voters* who didn't like Trump wanted a mild candidate to back rather than a far left winger who they could write off as being just as bad as Trump (they didn't know just how fucked Trump was), and no it wasn't obvious to said conservative voters just how rotten the GOP as a whole was.\n\nNow I ask: Who are the *they*, who wouldn't work with Biden? \n\nLet's stay on message: *Blame.

That's just nonsense.  They got it by catering to their ideological right wing instead of shunning them and insisting that they need to focus on mythical swing voters.  The voting loyalty followed that.  \n\nThe Democrats need to eventually wake up and embrace their left wing instead of constantly shunning them for a few swing voters.  Maybe then they will get the same type of constant turnout.\n\nThis idea that it's about a *pro-vote message* is never ever going to work by itself.\ntevinodevost: The GOP was able to cater to their ideological right wing because *they had the votes*. Manchin and Sinema make it so we *don't* have the votes, and even when it looked like the GOP was doing little to nothing about the abortion stuff (and moderates were being told the GOP was just cynically using the abortion stuff but had no intention on acting on it), the number of anti-abortion SCOTUS justices was building, building, building up until it finally was enough.  They played the long game.\n\nYou are not talking to the Democratic National Committee on here. You are talking to *voters*. It is in *voters*' best interest to vote against religious fascism, yes? So I tell people to ask other Redditors to do what is in their best interest, no matter how anemic the DNC is. Because anemic beats outright fascist any day of the week.\nnutmeggerking: &gt;The GOP was able to cater to their ideological right wing because they had the votes. Manchin and Sinema\n\nNo, they were doing this BEFORE they came to power.  Like the lead up to the 2010 midterms and the Tea Party.  \n\nHell, compare how Trump reacted to anytime a Republican went against him. Scorched earth, got his base riled up and made it clear that it was that Republican going against the party and Trump.  With Biden, you heard fuck all for months when Manchin and Sinema sabotaged the entire agenda.  Even now, you hear him meekly name them (compare it to how Sanders has no problem ripping Manchin apart). \n\nThe point is that simply pivoting all attention to the Republicans and saying \"vote vote vote\" isn't going to make anything happen.  Our leaders are inept and unwilling to take basic steps without being pressured into it every fucking step of the way.  People will only fight as hard as their leaders so if you want them to join your message about how the GOP is leading us to Christian-fascism, then get the leadership to pump out that message.\ntevinodevost: That's the thing: Many of the people who voted against Trump (not for Biden, against Trump) *didn't want an aggressive Trump*. They wanted a mild mannered guy who would work across the aisle. They didn't want to vote for a left wing version of Trump. The fact Biden won his primaries shows this, as does the fact he won the general. *Now* in hindsight we know moderate doesn't work anymore, but we needed a moderate to defeat Trump in 2020, and then to see how the GOP would treat that said moderate. We can now pivot to Gavin Newsom.\n\nAlso think of Biden as an olive branch, that the GOP spat in the face of. We needed ordinary Joes to *see* that happen. They wouldn't believe us otherwise. The GOP showed us who they were.\n\nAnd yes, saying \"vote vote vote\" and pivoting attention to the Republicans *is* going to make it happen because that's exactly what the GOP did to their voters. And they did it again and again. No matter how inept (Trump) they were, they got gains (Trump's three supreme court picks).

{"full_text": "xanderrobar: Hot tub proofing a room\nI have recently purchased a house that has another building in the backyard. The previous owner used it as a wood shop. I would like to turn it into a man cave, but it will need some renovations to be suitable for this. Primarily, I have a Softub hot tub (http://www.softubcanada.com/softub-220.asp) and would like to make the room safe for its use. \n\nThe floors are just wooden planks, and the flooring is standard drywall. I'm worried about the amount of moisture from the tub, both in terms of making the walls crumble, and any splashing causing the floors to rot out.\n\nCan anyone recommend a way to \"hot tub proof\" this room/building? I have been told that I can apply sealant to the drywall to protect it. I have been thinking that if I lay down proper tile flooring with drainage troughs around the edges, that combined with protection of the drywall might be OK to deal with the moisture/splashing. Any other suggestions?\n[deleted]: I think humidity damage is inevitable but you can take steps to minimize and reduce the damage.\n\n* Proper flooring.   A nice tile or vinyl floor is going to be much more resistant than wood floor.\n\n\n* Drywall - It will probably be fine as long as it's well painted.   You may want to re-paint and seal the drywall once a year with a bathroom rated paint.\n\n* Ventilation - I would install a bathroom style fan that's rated for at least as many sq feet as your room and perhaps it's a good idea to oversize it.   Remember, for an exhaust fan you'll also need a place for fresh air to come in.   Have this fan on a timer.   Run it whenever the cover is off the tub and for 30-60 minutes after you put the cover on.\n\n* More? - If water is going to be splashing directly on any drywall, it's probably not good.  Replace this drywall with tile, or something more resistant to moisture.\nIf you wanted to go real fancy you could finish much of the room in cedar like a sauna.   \n\n* Caulking - If you anticipate lots of water on the floor, or on any place it might be wise to caulk places where the water might run.  I'm thinking like along the baseboards.\n\n* Cleaning - Keep the place clean.  Mop up any standing water on the floor when you're done.\n\n\nI think with some common sense you should have few problems.\n \nxanderrobar: Thank you! This is some great advice. I hadn't considered that most solutions designed for bathrooms should similarly work for this hot tub room. \nthews: These are all good ideas, but definitely add some extra foundation where the hot tub will be.  And it would be best to tile the floor with enough slope to push water into a drain spot.  You wouldn't necessarily have to drain it into the sewer,  putting a P pipe on it and letting it slope off outside somewhere where it won't mess up the foundation would be okay.\nxanderrobar: Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_%28plumbing%29) what you mean when you say \"P Pipe\"? I would definietely have to do what you're suggesting, as this building has no water running to it. It has a fully separate electrical panel and a natural gas line with gas heater, but no water (and therefore no drainage into the sewer very easily). \nyoda2088: Afraid to click the link.\nheaded4thecrapper: p-pipe or a p-trap is just a p-shaped piece of pipe that holds water to prevent sewer gasses from coming out.\n\nMight be good to tile the whole damn thing and put a floor drain in the middle so that any standing water has somewhere to go?\n", "prompt": "xanderrobar: Hot tub proofing a room\nI have recently purchased a house that has another building in the backyard.

I'm sorry you just looked a little familiar, have we met before?\" Bam ice breaker done, then see where the convo goes.\n\nAlso, and this goes for all people with social anxiety, every day you are alone, just workout a little. Do super slow pushups, put your legs against the wall and hold a handstand. Lift whatever you can that's heavy. This helps change your brain chemistry, and it makes you a bit stronger and healthier, so it's great to do in general, obviously of course. Part of our problem (used to be mine, not anymore, I'll explain below) is our brain chemistry, our hormones, the wiring and activity of different regions of our brains. Trust me when I say it will have a tremendous affect on your emotions, your paranoia and anxiety, your thoughts in general, everything about what makes you who you are.\n\nIt's not that only confident, relaxed, chill, awesome people did sports in high school and all that shit. They became that way because they were more active, and being active a lot, depending on the intensity of their physical activities, altered their brain chemistry to give them that kind of confidence and relaxation around large groups of people. It's not the sole factor of course, it's not like every person that exercises and trains a lot becomes a Jersey Shore douche, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, or like Shaq, or any particular athletic celebrity personality. You will still be uniquely you, with all your likes and dislikes being relatively the same, with new interests possibly, except yea you will be more like a confident, more mature, energetic, adult-you.\n\nYou will be less stressed and anxious, you will be more comfortable just talking to people, you'll start feeling like you're in a different state of mind where everything isn't all up in your face and prickling your nerves with anxiety darts and shit. \n\nI used to be afraid of random people at restaurants watching me eat, and one time a cute girl my age sat at a table across from me, and I could not eat the whole time even though she pretty much never looked at me. That's just the tip of the iceberg of how socially anxious and awkward I was. Now I work at one of the most popular casinos, and before that I was a salesmen at a very very high volume sporting goods store, and a teenage fashion clothing store. I made love to a woman the first night we met off Tinder, and we meet up a few times a week now, and it's awesome.\n\nMy social anxiety is pretty much gone. The only time I'm ever socially anxious is when one of the directors of the casino walks in and asks me something, but only on weeks where I feel like I haven't been doing my best.\n\nSo take it from me, find a chance whenever you can each night to do some very slow moderate to heavy lifting, a little meditation and relaxation, and talk to people with certain thoughts in mind that remind you to stop taking every little moment so seriously and just relax and enjoy these moments, especially when you are talking to a beautiful woman, and don't worry about them judging you every single second and trying to always look the best, smell the best, and say the best things. As long as you are putting in somewhat effort to wear clean clothes and shower, and talk with a moderate smile on your face, instead of looking like you are so sad and lifeless that you wanna die (smiling is 100x more attractive than frowning, go ahead and take a picture of yourself doing both faces), you will do just fine.\n\nAnyways yea, go talk to her, and practice those de-stressing techniques.\njtw97: Epic comment.\n", "prompt": "[deleted]: meeting tinder match (in class)\n[deleted]\ncelt1299: I'd use it as an opportunity to strike up a conversation and tell her \"You look familiar.\" Then she can mention that you met on tinder or she could provide another answer if she's not comfortable with it.\njonj", "orig": "onthemanman: \"Hi my name is fetussmasher.

His response was to finish nail the living shit out of everything hundreds of times where only a dozen or so nails would do the job. In several closets, our prep guys would come out laughing because of where he'd nailed the shelf supports up, he'd gone so far as to nail \" FUCK YOU\" out as a tight-knit pattern so that it was easily readable. At first we filled them in and sanded them smooth before painting so that they were not visible, but after a while we started deliberately puttying them so that they would shrink just below the surface, leaving gentle dimples that would reveal a message that had been left for us. \n\nWe'd paint over it and let the inspector find them, and we'd explained what happened and we'd tried to get rid of them but there were so many and so deep that more shrinkage must have occurred after the paint was applied.\n\nNeedless to say, that dude was called on and fired. Every closet was reinspected and the ones that were found to have the offending message got torn out and redone.\n\nNot exactly fair to him as he understandably felt burned for losing his nail gun, but really it's one thing to throw extra nails into a board and yet another to go so far as nailing out \"FUCK YOU\" in several houses.\n\n\nCafeSilver: As someone who bought a house where the previous owner went way overboard with finish nails I have just one thing to say: fuck that guy.

{"full_text": "Spreadsheet: Can you spot any holes in my moral idea regarding charity?\nI have an idea regarding the moral necessity of giving to charity.\n\nGiven that:\n\n* You have disposable income\n* You would help someone out if they were dying\n* There is a charity that will cure preventable diseases in third-world nations\n* This charity does not create a reliance in the third-world nations for aid\n* Giving to this charity is more moral than using it yourself to buy items. For example, even if it is only 50% efficient (only 50% goes to actual aid), it is still more moral to give to this charity because 50% more of your money will go to good, rather than buying the item (none of your money is really helping people)\n* Even if it creates a reliance, it is still better because you are relieving a problem (helping out someone who is dying is not going to make them rely on others to help them out).\n\nTherefore you should give to this charity with your disposable income.\n\nI realize that this is not philosophy, but I don't know of any other subreddit that is suitable for this. The biggest potential hole would be that if too many people join from one particular city, there will be an economic downturn in that city. However I don't expect *that* many people to donate to this charity.\nlrc1123: These kinds of arguments are very difficult. There are implicit assumptions that not everybody is willing to make. Everybody has disposable income, if they have a job (with few exceptions). Yes, some people work only paycheck to paycheck, but if you make more than, say, 12,000 a year then you have disposable income. Working paycheck to paycheck may still apply, but only because they keep buying more expensive things, moving to a more expensive neighborhood etc. I know people making 80,000 a year that say they are working paycheck to paycheck and barely getting by. Is that true? No, it's because they had to buy a bigger house and more expensive cars. There is a line for basic survival, and after that, anything is technically disposable. So, how much of that should we give? \n\nSecond, helping someone out if they were dying: are you stating this as a fact, or a moral dilemma? Should one always help those who are dying? Well, no, because that's impossible. Everybody is dying. If I had an operation today that would extend my life by three weeks, even though I won't die for another 80 years, are you morally obligated to pay for my operation? No. Nobody would make that claim. So there is a type of necessity in the type of help that one needs, correct? Only those that need the help, but you are assuming we as humans know where that distinction is.\n\nI give a lot of money to charity when I can, and plan on doing it more and more. But the moment somebody tells me that I *need* to because it's moral, a little part of me dies and part of me doesn't want to give anymore. Anybody making more than X should give all their money to charity, but to which charity?\n\nLet me ask you this. If somebody told a millionare that he needs to give money to the less fortunate, a lot of people would get on board with that, correct? Yes. What if he gives a million dollars to somebody making 100,000 per year? That person very well could be living paycheck to paycheck, and is technically less fortunate. Would people be mad? Hell Yes! You see the dilemma here? To simply say that you need to do this, or do that, is an absurd over simplification. What counts as being 'less fortunate'? Somebody making 15,000 should give 3,000 to those making 9,000? What counts as 'dying'? Dying immediately? In the next couple years? \n\nThese are all things that seem obvious to us. If the rich man gave money to the slightly less rich man we would be furious. We can tell when something seems moral or not. We can't always explain the situations which make them moral, however, which makes it very difficult to necessitate certain aspects.\n\nTL;DR. People who give to charity are great. But making it necessary is nearly impossible.\naradil: &gt; But the moment somebody tells me that I need to because it's moral, a little part of me dies and part of me doesn't want to give anymore. \n\nYou don't *need* to do anything because it is moral. You choose to do the things that are moral because you believe that being moral is the right thing to do. I do things that I don't think are moral all the time.\n\nClearly I don't *need* to be moral. Choosing one less moral option than another just means that I accept that I'm not perfect.\n[deleted]: You *should* be moral.\n\n&gt;I do things that I don't think are moral all the time. Choosing one less moral option than another just means that I accept that I'm not perfect.\n\nWhy would you choose to do something that you know is wrong?\naradil: Convenience, societal pressure, increasing personal comfort, monetary gain, to protect your family...\n\nEvery time I eat meat I am stating that I believe that the sacrifice of the lives of animals for my enjoyment is okay; but I don't believe that is true. Then why do I continue? For my personal enjoyment. To fit in.\n\nI'm simply placing more weight on my own happiness than on what I believe is right. I realize this makes me sound like a bad person, but I'd rather be bad than dishonest.\n\nAlso, I agree with the OP here as well - I think that as much effort as possible should be spent to help those who need help. But I choose not to in order to benefit myself. Why? For the same reasons listed above.\n\nThat doesn't mean I shouldn't try to be *more* moral. Every day I try to eat less meat. I spend less on my self and try to help others.  I would argue that if at every moral crossroads I chose the most moral path, I would likely end up depressed, despite the fact that I knew I was living the most \"correct\" way possible; depressed people often produce less for society than they can.\n\nI could make the argument that by choosing to overlook small decisions in favor of self indulgence I am actually helping society more, but I don't think that is perfectly honest either.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that I'm not perfect, and clearly I allow my own comfort to override what I think is right.\n[deleted]: &gt;I'm simply placing more weight on my own happiness than on what I believe is right. I realize this makes me sound like a bad person, but I'd rather be bad than dishonest...The fact of the matter is that I'm not perfect, and clearly I allow my own comfort to override what I think is right.\n\nYou're aware that you're a bad person.

Most people just plain don't care and those who care don't try hard enough. \n\nMay you one day garner the strength.\naradil: There is a difference between a bad person, a good person, a perfect person, and an ignorant person.\n\nYou fall into the latter category.\n[deleted]: What makes you say that?\naradil: For not realizing the difference between doing bad things and being a bad person.\n\nA well intentioned person who doesn't *always* do the right thing is not automatically a bad person. If I value the wellbeing of my family over others, this doesn't make me a bad person, even if it causes me to do something that isn't the most moral action.\n\nI assume you are a vegan who donates 100% of their disposable income to charity, and all of their time to helping who need help but can't find it?\n\nNo? Are you a bad person? I couldn't say so by those metrics, but I'd say that those are the most moral actions you could be taking, and anything else would be \"bad\" or dishonest.\n[deleted]: I'd say that a bad person is one who intentionally does things that they know are wrong.\n\nWorth noting: less right isn't wrong.\naradil: I think that there are things that are \"wrong\", which aren't sufficiently bad enough infractions to call someone a bad person.\n\nI don't personally believe I'm a bad person simply because I do things that I think are \"bad\", or \"wrong\". I also do a lot of good things.

Hour or two later it over heated, who would\u2019ve thought.... We\u2019re tight on space in the house, so wherever me or my son wants to log some time on the consoles, I roll the cart to and from and plug the power strip in and we\u2019re good to go. \n\nAnyway, the cabinet itself is a little too tall to bring the monitor to eye level, which isn\u2019t the biggest deal, and not my main concern. (I\u2019m hoping I can mount the monitor on some type of arm to bring it down and in front of the cabinet for comfortability, but I have yet to find such an arm/mount that clamps or mounts to a surface AND the monitor/TV.) \n\nFurther, to create less clutter and cables all over the place, I\u2019d really like to fashion some way to keep the consoles *inside* the cabinet. Even with the doors open it gets to an uncomfortable temperature.\n\nI\u2019ve never done anything like this, but I also don\u2019t want to cut holes and mount some PC fans and do all of the wiring if it won\u2019t matter in the long run/wont work. \n\nCurious to see if anyone has done anything like this, or could offer some ideas!! Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the help! Now that the cooling issue is resolved, does anyone have any idea for a monitor arm that swivels, extends and lowers? Sorry if that sounds incorrect, I just don\u2019t know the proper term for what it would be.

Im just unsure of what to order. I did make it seem more exhausting than it actually would be, I just don\u2019t want to cut holes into it and make it look worse with no actual benefit if that makes sense. \n\nI am also unsure of how to power them? I\u2019m a little dumb in the electronics world and wiring unless it has to do with audio lol.\nNegaodabazuka: most of coolers out there use 12v i guess,you could use 2 of them to each sector of the cabinet or even 1 idk\na simple 12v power supply can handle the job.\nJaybles727: So would one 12v power supply power all 4 fans in that example? Or would I need a power supply for each fan?\nNegaodabazuka: yes,look for a 12v ac/dc adaptor with 2A to 3A\nand for the coolers 120mm ones will do the job,the brand doesnt really matter but the good ones are corsair and coolermaster\nJaybles727: Thanks for the help!

For brevity's sake, we'll say they were in love.  Now, as scientists have shown 'love' to be merely a variation in normally functioning brain chemicals (oxytocin, dopamine, norepinephrine, etc), what would be the distinction between treating love as a deviant behavior, and others (eg depression, adhd, obesity, etc.)? If treated, the boy will do better in school, life, etc.  How is the distinction to be made?\n\nEdit: A few people have made the distinction that something like 'love' is a result of evolution and benefits the person.  However, I would contend that anxiety ( which helps motivate us, get things done) and add/adhd (tends to make for divergent thinking, outside the box problem solving skills) are also the result of natural selection, and are beneficial to mankind.  Both of which are medically treated pretty standardly.  \nDReicht: &gt;Now, as scientists have shown 'love' to be merely a variation in normally functioning brain chemicals (oxytocin, dopamine, norepinephrine, etc)\n\nThey have? \ndrippysoap: Biologically speaking, I would say [yes.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_basis_of_love#Neurochemistry)\nDReicht: Chemical variation is a proximate mechanism. To say merely is incorrect. \ndrippysoap: In comparison to \"soulmates\" or destined lovers, I felt merely was appropriate.  If you feel that it detracts from the discussion though, feel free to read it with a more palatable adjective. \nDReicht: Well I think you're simplifying a very complex and interesting situation into something quite boring with a frankly inaccurate representation.\n\nIf we're talking science (which you introduced) love probably evolved for a very specific reason. While I'm not familiar with any scientific literature on love (if you're interested in a problem, figure out how to quantify love or empathy! Hormones won't work - if you're familiar with the lit.) we can shoot the shit right here.\n\nSociobiology suggests that behaviors have an adaptive value. While humans have experienced a significant relaxation of selection (allowing for increased complexity and plasticity in behavior and form) love probably has some evolutionary origin. A relatively distinctive human trait (with respect to other primates) is our heavy use of cooperative rearing. Love makes some sense in this context as it would provide for the formation of dyads, increasing the likelihood of cooperative fitness with increased awareness of paternity. I'm sure someone can come up with a better reason than that.\n\nLove isn't merely evolutionary though. It also carries cultural weight and is part of the cultural signal. There is psychological meat to it as well and experiential. Some people never love. Some only love deviant things. Some people repress love regardless of its evolutionary value, other people warmly accept it without ever using it to increase their fitness.\n\nProximate mechanism always have a 'big picture' to them. A reductionist account never gets anyone very far.\n\nIn light of this, deviant behaviors may be pathological or evolutionary (but don't fit into a cultural norm). I think your question has to be a bit more specific to touch on that. Obesity is pathological but depression is a bit more complicated?\n\nAlso, there are psychological reasons for the failure of adolescent males to exhibit strong executive functions/reasoning.\n\nI'm just sort of confused by your question. Deviance is a cultural question but you're trying to bring science into it and I don't understand how. Sorry &gt;_&lt;\ndrippysoap: No, I'm sorry if I've been unclear and thanks for sticking with me here.  \n\n&gt;A reductionist account never gets anyone very far.\n\nI think this sentiment is at the very heart of the issue.  Yet, it is how, I think, many psychological conditions are viewed and treated.  Let's take anxiety for example (and I believe there are many others).  By treating anxiety, you invariably alter personality traits of the patient.  Now, maybe their anxiety is so overwhelming they'll commit suicide without medication.  Here, most people (it's okay if you're not one of them) I would think would justify the use of medication.  The distinction I'm looking for, is where do we draw the line?  Humans evolve with things anxiety, ADHD, Love, all for benefical reasons, as you pointed out.  So, in strictly biological terms, where do we draw the line of medically treating deviant behavior.  100 years ago there were hardly any (if any at all) psychological disorders diagnosed.  I suspect in 100 years there will be many more, and likely everyone could fit under some realm of 'psychologically deviant' as it is doubtful any of us are truly and fully normal.  So do where do we make the distinction for what should be medically treated as deviant, and what shouldn't?  Hope that clarifies some things.  \nDReicht: So, I think there's a confusion of evolution and culture here. Deviance is defined culturally, but many behaviors are adaptive or pathological in a biological or evolutionary perspective. We're talking two different realms that work in two different ways and are really two different *types* of things. The biological realm is one of objectivity - things *are*. The sociological/human realm is one of objectivity and subjectivity - things don't just exist but they also are thought of and valued/devalued. These two realms twist and turn into each other - we're not talking geometric planes but interlocking hands. Maybe a mobius strip is the best metaphor. The sociological human realm exists on top of the objective one.\n\nMind you, I am in no way familiar with ontology. So sorry for sounding really dumb about things I'm unfamiliar with.\n\nTl;dr - there is no clear cut answer or line between deviance and medicine. Lobotomies were acceptable 50 years ago. Now ask the average person and they'd be repulsed, probably. But we still do lobotomies sometimes. Chemical lobotomies are considered great things by many.\n\nEven when deviance alone is considered, cases are not clear cut. What I consider deviant you may not. Top 5% of the wealthiest Americans may not consider the same behaviors deviant as the next 5%. Socioeconomic indicators falter in the face of experiential determinants - many white, middle class males are anarchists.\n\nAlso, am not familiar with anthropology or sociology of deviance.\n\nSorry for the remarks. Hope I made some contribution. :X\n\nI guess my answer would be personal decisions should have the most weight. Besides that, we work with the cultural norms. 800 years ago I would have felt very differently about my daughter's bipolar disorder than I would now. How we treat that philosophically? I have no idea.\nbitsofsick: &gt;...sorry for sounding really dumb about things I'm unfamiliar with.\n\nOh please, it's clear you're sharper than a well-pressed suit.

{"full_text": "Sykirobme: The War On Stupid People - American society increasingly mistakes intelligence for human worth\n\nSykirobme: I think this is an interesting article and ties into a lot of thoughts I've had along similar lines over the years since I was a writing and math tutor in college.  Some people just aren't made for higher education, and there's nothing wrong with that, yet we tend to denigrate trades and low-skill labor in this country...and with the rapid automation of everything from food service to driving to warehousing, what are those whose talents lie outside academia to do?\nXivero: I have a few problems with the article.\n\n1.  it makes no attempt to actually define \"human worth\". I suspect the author doesn't even know himself what he means by it, beyond having a vague idea that all people have some sort of mystical inherent value. But of course they don't. Something (or someone) is only ever valuable to someone for some reason. Now, there are a great many reasons why we might value someone, but surely everyone can agree that one of those reasons is intelligence.\n\n2. His argument doesn't seem to be that stupidity is good, but that intelligence alone is insufficient to make someone a good employee, or presumably a good person. Except no one actually believes otherwise, as he himself recognizes: \"The employment Web site Monster captures current hiring wisdom in its advice to managers, suggesting they look for candidates who, of course, 'work hard' and are 'ambitious' and 'nice'\".\n\n3. He points out that many jobs can be done perfectly well by, if not stupid people, at least merely average ones. And of course this is true. However, an intelligent employee is much more versatile and a better investment for the future. Surely companies will settle for average people if that's all they can get, but why would they when they can get above average ones?\nSykirobme: 1. He's arguing people determine worth by a flawed metric (academic achievement/performance).\n\n2. He's arguing against the idea that intelligence alone is sufficient to make a good employee.  From the article: \"But even as high intelligence is increasingly treated as a job prerequisite, evidence suggests that it is not the unalloyed advantage it\u2019s assumed to be. \"\n\n3. You missed the point he makes that the metric of academic intelligence might not be a good one.  From the article: \"The late Harvard Business School professor Chris Argyris argued that smart people can make the worst employees, in part because they\u2019re not used to dealing with failure or criticism. Multiple studies have concluded that interpersonal skills, self-awareness, and other \u201cemotional\u201d qualities can be better predictors of strong job performance than conventional intelligence, and the College Board itself points out that it has never claimed SAT scores are helpful hiring filters.\"\n\nA good summary, again from the article: \"We must stop glorifying intelligence and treating our society as a playground for the smart minority. We should instead begin shaping our economy, our schools, even our culture with an eye to the abilities and needs of the majority, and to the full range of human capacity.\"\n\nHe's arguing almost the opposite of what you seem to say he is.\nXivero: &gt; He's arguing people determine worth by a flawed metric (academic achievement/performance)\n\nYes, but he doesn't state how *he* determines it. He mentions other things an employer might look for, but he doesn't actually define what he thinks is a good metric for determining \"human worth\". I suspect because the term, as he is using it, is meaningless.\n\n&gt; He's arguing against the idea that intelligence along is sufficient to make a good employee. \n\nYes, and my point is that no one thinks otherwise. It's a strawman, in other words.\n\n&gt; You missed the point he makes that the metric of academic intelligence might not be a good one.\n\nI didn't miss it. It's just flawed. Essentially, most people take intelligence as being necessary but not sufficient for being a good employee. What he says reinforces the idea that it is not sufficient, but it doesn't show that it isn't necessary. He's setting up a false dichotomy, as if the choice is between people with academic intelligence or people with interpersonal skills, self-awareness, and other emotional qualities\". But of course someone can be simultaneously academically inclined, self-aware, and sociable.\nSykirobme: &gt; he doesn't actually define what he thinks is a good metric for determining \"human worth\"\n\nHe doesn't think there should be a single metric for worth.  Read the summary I quoted.\n\n&gt; Yes, and my point is that no one thinks otherwise. It's a strawman, in other words.\n\nYou said: \"His argument doesn't seem to be that stupidity is good, but that intelligence alone is insufficient to make someone a good employee, or presumably a good person.\"  That's the opposite of what the article is arguing.\n\nAnyway, he gives plenty of examples of how intellect is valorized above all else at the beginning of the article.  It's an attitude so ingrained as to be invisible to most.\n\nAlso:\n\n\"At the same time, those positions that can still be acquired without a college degree are disappearing. The list of manufacturing and low-level service jobs that have been taken over, or nearly so, by robots, online services, apps, kiosks, and other forms of automation grows longer daily.\"\n\n\"Intelligence and academic achievement have steadily been moving up on rankings of traits desired in a mate; researchers at the University of Iowa report that intelligence now rates above domestic skills, financial success, looks, sociability, and health.\"\n\n\" 'Every society through history has picked some trait that magnifies success for some,' says Robert Sternberg, a professor of human development at Cornell University and an expert on assessing students\u2019 traits. \u201cWe\u2019ve picked academic skills.'\"\n\nHe cites the disappearance of unskilled labor employment, cites a study on how intelligence is valued more than other traits on an interpersonal level, and also quotes a qualified researcher.  This isn't an academic paper, but the writer HAS done his homework.\n\n&gt;  But of course someone can be simultaneously academically inclined, self-aware, and sociable.\n\nPeople can be, but people who combine all those qualities are not the norm.\nXivero: &gt; At the same time, those positions that can still be acquired without a college degree are disappearing. The list of manufacturing and low-level service jobs that have been taken over, or nearly so, by robots, online services, apps, kiosks, and other forms of automation grows longer daily.\n\nThis is not happening because we overvalue intelligence. This is happening because automation is cheaper and more efficient than people. The author is reversing cause and effect - we value intelligence more highly because fewer and fewer jobs are left that don't require it, and most of those that are left are likely to shift at some point to ones that do.\n\n&gt; Intelligence and academic achievement have steadily been moving up on rankings of traits desired in a mate;\n\nWell, yes, because it's becoming more and more important for success generally. These are both quotes that support the idea that society is tending to value intelligence more highly. Neither show that doing so is a mistake, and the first provides the reason why it probably isn't.\n\n\nSykirobme: &gt; This is happening because automation is cheaper and more efficient than people.\n\nTrue enough, but that means people who would have found careers working low/unskilled jobs or who would have found work in trades have fewer avenues to pursue employment.\n\nBut that's a bit of a digression, and that little piece of the author's argument isn't the strongest part of the overall argument.\n\nAgain, the article makes the point that academic intelligence is not an accurate or reliable marker of what makes a good employee.  And before you say \"but people can be both things,\" remember this point the author has made: \"The employment Web site Monster captures current hiring wisdom in its advice to managers, suggesting they look for candidates who, of course, \u201cwork hard\u201d and are \u201cambitious\u201d and \u201cnice\u201d\u2014but who, first and foremost, are \u201csmart.\u201d To make sure they end up with such people, more and more companies are testing applicants on a range of skills, judgment, and knowledge...To be sure, many of these tests scrutinize personality and skills, rather than intelligence. But intelligence and cognitive-skills tests are popular and growing more so. In addition, many employers now ask applicants for SAT scores (whose correlation with IQ is well established); some companies screen out those whose scores don\u2019t fall in the top 5 percent.\"\n\nAcademic ability is being placed above all else as a metric of determining fitness for employment (simply because it's the easiest thing to measure objectively).  The article cites reasons why that shouldn't be the case.  The author doesn't say people can't possess all those traits, he's saying that prioritizing a single trait above all else is not a good strategy for finding excellent workers.  You'll potentially get plenty of intelligent people who are poor workers while you miss out on less academically inclined people who have excellent skills that would allow them to thrive despite a low IQ or SAT score.\n\nGotta be up in four hours so I can go look at houses...happy to continue tomorrow.

{"full_text": "Zestyclose-Detail791: 77 years ago on this day (11:02 am), plutonium-core \"Fat Man\" was detonated over Nagasaki, releasing 88 terajoules energy (\u2248 21K tons of TNT). \"Fat Man\" remains the largest nuclear bomb to be detonated over a civilian city, killing 35-40 thousand people instantly, and &gt;80 thousand people eventually.\n\nCousin-Jack: Just hear to read the US apologetics about how this particular civilian massacre saved countless lives and ended the war heroically.\n\nYou rarely get such a clear demonstration of Allied propaganda as the response to this kind of post on Reddit, and what always surprises me is that it has lasted so long.\npaxwax2018: Maybe read about the atrocities of the battle of Okinawa? The US wasn\u2019t interested in a 100x worse repeat on the mainland.\nCousin-Jack: Thank you for another example.  So to clarify, is your argument 'Well if they're committing war-crimes, so can we', or 'Well if they're attacking our military, we'll massacre their civilians'? \n\nMaybe read some Hachiya who documented his experiences as a doctor in Hiroshima following the massacres, and you'll find out just what did interest the US.\npaxwax2018: Tough times in the Russian ministry of concern trolling, eh comrade?\nCousin-Jack: Brilliant!   So by pointing out first-hand testimony of the horrors of nuclear warfare, I'm a 'Russian troll'?  And you're doing this to challenge my argument that you're affected in US propaganda?  I literally couldn't get you to exemplify my point any more clearly!  Thanks!  :)\npaxwax2018: What argument is that sorry? That by some perverted logic the Japanese are the victims of WWII? Am I supposed to weep that the Americans after Hiroshima were callous and indifferent to the suffering? All I can see on Wikipedia about your Dr is \u201cConditions at the hospital drastically improve as more medical supplies are bought into the city.\u201d\nCousin-Jack: Ah a Wikipedia professor, I see.  Hachiya is a well-known first-hand source who recorded the aftermath as a diary.  It's fascinating and harrowing.  If you knew anything about the impact of the atom bombs you wouldn't need to look him up on Wikipedia.\n\nIf you're American (or exposed to the propaganda) no you're not expected to weep.  According to my argument, you're expected to be indifferent and defensive of the massacre, and to find ways of denying that the civilians of Nagasaki and Hiroshima were victims.  My argument is that the US propaganda about it would make you like this, whereas those of us (even allies) who aren't exposed to it to the same degree generally have a more critical view of war crimes.\n\nSo far, so good.  What else can you add to give weight to my argument?\npaxwax2018: You\u2019re right, I don\u2019t give a single fuck about the suffering of the Japanese. FAFO.\nCousin-Jack: Yep.  Not everyone can see through propaganda.  Apparently, not everyone can see the irony of 'not giving a fuck' about civilians, while criticising Japan for that same attitude.  Good work.\npaxwax2018: You\u2019re missing the part where they started it, and the part where it stopped the instant they surrendered rather than it being the mere beginning of a systemic butchery the scale of which will stain Japan for eternity. Scream about propaganda all you want comrade, I see you.\nCousin-Jack: I mean even for a mouthpiece for US propaganda, you've really gulped that Kool-aid haven't you?\n\nThey started it?  I haven't heard that argument since I was about 8.  So yes, like I predicted it's the whole \"They committed war-crimes, so we get to commit war-crimes too\" argument.  Funny stuff.  But yeah, you managed to lower yourself to the barbarity of the Japanese and beyond in a single moment.  Nice one.  \n\nThe irony is that committing the worst ever atomic massacre of civilians on record will be on America's record for ever, but true enough - it's an act of genius that they've brainwashed their population to defending it all these decades later.  You see nothing, and that's the problem.\npaxwax2018: Killing the enemy isn\u2019t a war crime, I think that\u2019s possibly where you\u2019re getting confused.\nCousin-Jack: Claiming civilian children and pensioners are 'the enemy' and slaughtering them *is*.  That's why you're getting confused.  \n\nHonestly, you couldn't demonstrate what I'm talking about any better than you already are.  It's impressive.  You're a bit of a caricature of US propaganda.\npaxwax2018: \u201cJapanese atrocities in World War II, including cannibalism, the slaughter and starvation of prisoners of war, rape and enforced prostitution, the murder of noncombatants, and biological warfare experiments.\u201d When a dog has rabies you shoot it dead, let the children cry about it.\nCousin-Jack: So like I said, your argument is now \"They committed war crimes first, so we can as well\".  Funny.  \"U.S. military personnel raped Okinawan women during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945\", \"engaged in human trophy collecting\", and massacred rescue parties and even people surrendering.  Tell me again what we do with a rabid dog?  \n\nAlso, which of those crimes you listed do you think was carried out by the civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?\npaxwax2018: Remind me what your plan would have been to defeat Japan without terrible casualties? You sound like someone who thinks they should have won.\nCousin-Jack: Another silly bout of propaganda - that massacring innocent civilians was the only way to win the war.  \n\nYou sound like someone who has never read a book on WW2 in their life.  There are countless theories about the alternatives, and they are well documented.  No solution avoids death altogether, but pretty much every solution involves fewer civilian casualties.  Solutions involving the atom bomb include delaying the Nagasaki bomb by a matter of days (saving a huge number of lives), or targetting Tokyo Bay (a military not civilian target). Diplomatic alternatives include clarifying Potsdam to explicitly allow for Japanese imperial continuity - there was little meaningful attempt to get Japan to surrender, as the US wanted to show off its new toy. Eisenhower practically admitted this, and 7 out of the 8 top US commanders at the time didn't believe it was necessary to use the atomic bomb. Finally, and most obviously, the Soviets in Manchuria were a bigger factor in the Japanese surrender than the bombs, and they had made (and were still making) incredible progress.  \n\nHow does that cognitive dissonance feel?\npaxwax2018: The demand was unconditional surrender. Stalin leading on the Japanese that he might intercede with the US on surrender terms actually meant the Japanese held out and the bombs were dropped as a direct consequence. Spare me the \u201chelpful Soviets\u201d narrative. The same invasion gave us the ongoing horror of North Korea, so I wouldn\u2019t be patting myself on the back to hard if your complaint is about avoidable human misery.\nCousin-Jack: Are you kidding? \"Helpful Soviets\", that's hilarious. I now know you haven't read any non-American commentaries on the war, admit it.  I always forget that the US is so fearful of Russia, they've all but erased the fact they won for us from the WW2 narrative.  To a European, it's bizarre.  \r  \n\r  \nStalin was a total monster, but his wreckless strategy of throwing his countrymen into the furnace allowed the Allies to win and forced Japan to surrender.  Soviets flooded Japan-controlled Manchuria with literally millions of soldiers at a time when the USA could never have put boots on the ground in any significant number.  Many historians place this and the preceding Russian declaration of war against Japan, as being more significant than the combined atomic massacres.  I mean Soviets were marching into battle while Americans were still cowering in their beds, trying to profit from the war and keep their hands clean. \r  \n\r  \nYes, the demand was unconditional surrender, but for no good reason other than wanting to show off your new mass-murder toy.  The continuity of the Imperial family (with new and draconian restrictions) would have allowed them to surrender without losing face, and the war would have ended without the US butchering civilians.  You had different priorities.  But like I said, that was only one of several viable alternatives that until yesterday you were unaware of.  Imagine what else your propaganda has hidden from you?\npaxwax2018: Who gives a shit about Manchuria? It was a land grab at the last second. The Russians had no capacity to invade the Japanese islands which was obviously the only thing the Japanese would have cared about by that point. The idea that being nuked twice didn\u2019t tip the balance for the Japanese is\u2026. Interesting. \n\nThank you for proving you\u2019re a Russian shill, \u201cAmericans were still cowering in their beds\u201d, lol. They\u2019re humiliating your glorious army in the Ukraine eh?\nCousin-Jack: Oh man, this is embarrassing.  I can see that books aren't your thing, but surely you could watch a documentary?  Please, look up some Glantz.  Don't worry, he's a fellow Yank so you shouldn't find it too triggering.  Then you can go on to testimony from other countries if you're brave enough.\r  \n\r  \n**Who gives a shit about Manchuria?**  Your ignorance is impressive.  Do you really not know?  OK, happy to teach you:  Manchuria was a crucial part of Japanese imperialist expansion.  They desperately wanted it as a buffer between them and the threat of the Soviets and communism.  The Russian occupation of Manchuria and the north of the Korean Peninsula allowed for those regions to be transferred by the Soviet Union into the control of local communists, exactly what Japan feared.  It is also basically the only time the Japanese army had come face to face with an enemy army and lost, and Tokyo had been desperately trying to call up reserves.  It was so important, that Manchuria was effectively the end of Japanese expansion and the surrender of the Kwangtung army.  The fact you don't know any of this shows that your propaganda has kept you in total ignorance.  This is taught to school kids in other countries, and you literally didn't know?\r  \n\r  \n\"The Ukraine\", haha.  You literally don't even know what the country is called!!  Yes, they are humiliating Russia in Ukraine and rightly so.  It's actually another good example of Russia ignorantly pumping troops into a conflict.  The difference is, in WW2 it won the fight for us and bought the Allies time, whereas in Ukraine it does nothing but show the world how their military has aged.  Well done trying to deflect the conversation though.\r  \n\r  \nIt's adorable that you think anyone that challenges your propaganda with historical fact is a Russian shill.  Still, if that's the case, I have demonstrated how I can happily criticise Russia.  You're obviously a US shill - can you do the same to your motherland?  Can you dare to admit that your enemy now was an Ally then, and they saved your neck?  Can you admit your humiliation at Pearl Harbor?  Can you admit that slaughtering children and pensioners by hundreds of thousands was wrong?  Can you admit that being too scared to fight fascism while your Allies were already on the frontlines is cowardly?  Or are you paid enough to keep your mouth shut?  Let's see what Captain Propaganda says...\npaxwax2018: Tl;dr\nCousin-Jack: Haha!  Thank you!  Wasn't hard to find the end of your attention span.  Well done for ducking all those inconvenient questions though, and thank you for demonstrating that you're not the type to be able to read a history book.  \"Who gives a shit about Manchuria\", lol!  Bless your cottons.  Now run along and try your propaganda on someone else.   :)\npaxwax2018: \u201cBasically the only time the Japanese army had fought an enemy army and lost.\u201d Interesting statement, one of us certainly needs to read more. Of course the Russians killed and raped their way across Manchuria and Korea and probably killed as many innocent people as the bombs did. \n\nWe learnt from WWI if you don\u2019t utterly smash genocidal racists they will try again, if I was Truman I\u2019d happily drop them again. \n\nI\u2019m not American, so swing and a miss there little buddy.\nCousin-Jack: OK Captain Propaganda, tell me another time that the Japanese army came face to face with their enemy in WW2 and lost to the point of surrender.  I can wait.  :)\r  \n\r  \nWW1?  Germany in WW1 was fascist or genocidal!  How did you not know that fascism didn't even formally exist at that point, but funny suggestion.  My god this is like grade school history.  And if you had learned anything about genocidal dictators you wouldn't have continued to opt for your cowardly 'non-interventionism'.  \n\nDon't pretend you cared about fascism and genocide when you didn't even dare join in against them for years.  Meanwhile, the world learned that cowardice and massacring of civilians sadly isn't limited to just the Axis powers.  \n\nYeah the Russians were monsters, but they won for us.  Those aren't mutually exclusive positions.  The US also killed and raped, and when they were threatened they only had the guts to drop bombs on civilians far below them.  I guess the US lost their appetite to fight face to face once they saw what the Japanese airforce could do to them.\r  \n\r  \nYou're American in that you've swallowed US propaganda completely.  You're the target market.  You literally didn't even know about Manchuria, I mean how??  Sadly, propaganda is spread outside a nation's borders and is believed by anyone gullible enough not to do their own research.  \r  \n\r  \nI know you'd do it again.  You would never have the confidence to actually fight face to face, and you've never had to learn what the rest of us learned in school.  \n\nLet me guess - too many awkward questions so \"TLDR\"?  :)\npaxwax2018: Well Burma comes to mind. (I\u2019m afraid to ask why you think the island campaigns don\u2019t count.) The Japanese forces in Manchuria were the leftovers and totally out of supply, literally a rabble. I didn\u2019t say I hadn\u2019t heard of the invasion of Manchuria it, I said I didn\u2019t care about it. It\u2019s a footnote of no military significance in the defeat of Japan. \n\nYou might want to read about the behaviour of the Germans in Poland in WWI, the labels might not have been invented but the intent is the same as in WWII. \n\nYou constantly talk about \u201cThe rest of us\u201d, who do you mean? My country fought every day of both wars, with an exceptional combat record. How does knowing that history count as American propaganda?\nCousin-Jack: Burma?  You really think Japanese forces surrendered in Burma?  They didn't formally surrender until after Hirohito announced the full surrender along with the other vestiges of their forces.  Same as Korea.\n\nYou clearly hadn't heard of Manchuria, and that's fine.  No wonder you totally misunderstood Japan's imperialistic objectives.  They were desperate to have a buffer between the Communists and them, so having to surrender was a massive turning point.  I will be amazed if you could find even one credible historian that disputes the importance of Manchuria.  Hasegawa pointed out that negotiations for surrender only happened after the Russian declaration of war, not Hiroshima.\n\nOh I see, you don't understand what *fascism* actually means, I get it.  You think it's just being militaristic perhaps, or expansionist.  I guess Genghis Khan was a fascist too, right?  OK well perhaps I've taught you that fascism fundamentally started in Italy after WW1.  Now you know.  At that time, Poland was more a victim of multinational imperialism (closer to the Brits than to the fascists).\n\n'The rest of us' are those without strong affiliations who are able to learn from testimonies of all sides.  'You' are the people who swallow unilateral propaganda and never stop to try and unpick what you've been told.  You defend the cowardice and genocide of the USA because you've been sucked in by the myth.  You clearly cherry-pick your sources very carefully if you dispute the role of the Soviets. Would you even dare to mention your own country, when you're so heavily dependent on the US?  I'll bet not.\n\nYou hadn't heard of Manchuria, you still don't understand its strategic relevance, you have no idea about the origins of fascism, and most ridiculously of all you dispute the role of the Soviets in WW2 - why exactly am I trying to discuss history with you?  Get off Reddit and read some Glantz.  There's too much for me to explain when your attention span is limited to 3 paragraphs at a time.\npaxwax2018: Is English your first language? You seem to struggle with nuance. You asked when did a Japanese Army get defeated \u201cTo the point of surrender.\u201d That doesn\u2019t have to mean they actually surrendered, just that they were defeated. \n\nYou appear to live in the U.K. but despise the West, and you write like you grew up screaming slogans. You\u2019re Chinese or Russian? It would explain why you\u2019re ashamed to tell me, and it would certainly explain the massive chip on your shoulder against the US. \n\n\u201cWould you even dare to mention your own country when you\u2019re so heavily dependent on the US. I\u2019ll bet not\u201d this sentence is nonsense, it has literally no meaning. \n\nThe Americans and British Empire defeated Japan. The Soviets jumped in just before the 3 month deadline from the surrender of Germany in order to get their share of the spoils. It was great for them, as far as territorial gains, but the Japanese were already beaten.\nCousin-Jack: *\"Is English your first language?... That doesn\u2019t have to mean they actually surrendered, just that they were defeated.\"*\r  \nCan you just re-read that please.  Of course 'to the point of surrender' means... literally.... to the point of surrender.  In Burma, they actually 'surrendered' only after the Empire had surrendered.  Meanwhile in Manchuria, they couldn't beat the Soviets and surrendered before the Empire.

I can see you do this a lot when you get triggered, but there could be no clearer mark of an impressionable mind than someone who thinks that anything challenging the US propaganda must be Chinese or Russian.  If you get to travel, you will find out why this is so ridiculous.  \r  \n\r  \n\" It would explain why you\u2019re ashamed to tell me\"\r  \nNice projection.  You haven't asked.  And when I asked you, you pretended not to understand the question.  Why would you be embarrassed?  It's clear where your allegiance is, and you're sticking very carefully to a script of US propaganda.  You claim your country fought 'every day' which must mean by definition you are Polish, as during the Phoney War no one else was fighting.  However, you didn't know what fascism is, nor about Manchuria, so you probably didn't know about that either.  My bet is that you're from some colonial outpost of the British Empire where you've lived in a mire of US media throughout your young life.  I appreciate you won't admit it.\r  \n\r  \nThe Allies defeated Japan, and you can't and won't find a historian who doesn't credit the Soviet Union to a significant extend.  I'm happy to stand corrected and I ask you again for your source.  The Soviets had already broken the back of the Nazis in Stalingrad and Kursk (a famous turning point) drawing attention away from the other fronts.  More Nazis died and more Nazi machinery was destroyed on the Eastern front than anywhere else.  That's a fact.  The Soviets then broke with their non-aggression pact (to the horror of Japan who wanted to use Moscow to broker a treaty) and flooded Manchuria with troops when the Americans couldn't, preventing Kwangtung from defending the home islands.  It's also a fact that the Japanese only started discussing full surrender immediately after the Soviets declared war, not immediately after Hiroshima.  The Soviets didn't want to help out the other Allies, and they won WW2 for selfish reasons, but they won it nonetheless.  \r  \n\r  \nIf you're interested in WW2, please do educate yourself on this - start with Glantz or Hasegawa, they're not too academic for you.  It's tempting to let what we know about the Soviets (and modern Russia) affect our views on the facts - no one likes to be saved by their enemy - but that's emotional bias and propaganda.  If you can't acknowledge their role in winning the war, you're either ignorant, biased, or both.  \n\nToo many awkward questions again?  Hit me with a TLDR.\npaxwax2018: Ah, Russian. Thanks for playing Cousin-Jackoff.\nCousin-Jack: You're very welcome.  It's genuinely been a pleasure to teach you a few key details, and don't worry - I'm not surprised you had nothing to say against my points, and that you're too embarrassed to say where you're from.

Salt water in a freezer is not any colder than regular water in the freezer.\n\nTHe difference is that the salt water temp will more gradually rise, while the regular water temp will rise then stabilize at 0c until its completely melted.\n\nI'm not saying you are wrong, or you shouldn't use salt water....I'm honestly wanting to know the advantage for when I do this myself.\njarfil: That's a good question. From what I understand:\n\n* Salt water stays liquid at lower temperatures than pure water (down to -21C).\n* Salt gets mostly excluded from the ice structure when it finally freezes, meaning the ice itself is basically pure water.\n* Thermal conductivity of ice is 4 times that of liquid water, but liquid water can move around while ice can't.\n* Ice has a lower density than liquid water, meaning it floats while liquid water sinks underneath.\n* Salt water has an even higher density than pure water.\n* Melting ice is an endothermic reaction, meaning that for every amount of ice that melts, the remaining ice gets a bit colder and can absorb than much more heat again before melting another bit.\n* Ice melts into pure water, but if it encounters salt, then it becomes salt water, which is much less likely to re-freeze at the same temperature.\n\nI think in this case, having salt in the water  should let the bottles stay at a colder temperature than if it was just pure water, with ice getting pushed up by salt water, getting on one side faster heat transmission and on the other lower temperature, which in turn will cool air to a lower temperature for the same airflow.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the whole setup could benefit from having two separate radiators: one that would stay in contact with the floating ice to pre-cool the incoming air, and another on the bottom in contact with the colder salt water, cooling it to the lowest possible temperature.\n04221970: I think pure water has slightly more heat capacity than salt water, so you can put more heat into it before it raises one degree celsius.\n\nI think the difference is not much 1.00 vs 0.93; but it would be an interesting experiment to see if cold/frozen salt water cools your room more efficiently than the same volume of pure water.\njarfil: Even with that difference in heat capacity, I think salt water might win, since it will start at a lower temperature. Let's say ambient is 40C (no point in cooling if it's 20C, right?), but plain water starts at 0C while salt water starts at -20C, then plain water will absorb 40\u00d71.00=40, while salt water will do 60\u00d70.93=55.\n\nI've been thinking about how to do this experiment, and I may have found a way:\n \n* Get two bottles, fill one with tap water, the other with saturated salt water (optionally fill a third one with demineralized water)\n* Freeze both bottles to the same temperature\n* Fill two identical containers with the same amount of tap water at the same temperature\n* Put a frozen bottle in each one, keeping them separate\n* Measure the temperature over time of water in each container\n\nThe area under the temperature curve over time, will correlate to the amount of heat absorbed by that bottle.\n04221970: why would you think that plain water  stored at -20C would 'start' at 0C?  So your calculation isn't correct; they are both rising 60 degrees.\n\n\nThe pure ice stored at -20C and the salt water/ice stored at -20C start at the same temperature.....-20C.\n\nTHen they both rise in temperature at some defined rate, though that rate may be different. At 0C the slushy ice/water and ice/water/salt mixtures will stabilize at 0C until all of the ice has melted...then they both rise in temperature again.  My suspicion is that the pure ice/water mixture will hold a stable 0C temp for longer since there will be more ice there.  But that the salt/ice/water mixture may raise temp slower between-20 and 0.  THis I don't know.\njarfil: The heat capacity is:\n\n* freshwater: 4184 J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121 (1.000 cal)\n* salt water: 3993 J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121 (0.954 cal)\n* ice: 2093 J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121 (0.500 cal)\n\n&gt; The pure ice stored at -20C and the salt water/ice stored at -20C start at the same temperature\n\n&gt; At 0C the slushy ice/water and ice/water/salt mixtures will stabilize at 0C until all of the ice has melted\n\nThis is the part I'm not so sure about. Ice doesn't melt until 0C, but at the same time salt water melts at -20C, and melting absorbs heat (is endothermic), so... what I think will happen is that the ice will keep heating up until 0C, at which point the one without salt will just become water and heat up the rest of the way, while the one with salt will become salt water which will drop below 0C.\n\nAnyway, it seems interesting and non-obvious enough to do the experiment and see what happens (I bet someone has done that before, but I couldn't find it).\n04221970: I too think this is a great experiment and haven't been able to find results. To complicate thing, I don't know if salt water actually freezes solid at -20...from what I understand it will fractionally crystalize out at more pure water ice surrounded by very salty water.  \n\nI did this myself several years ago where I froze salt water in bottles to put in a cooler, and never got the bottles to completely freeze at -20.  they just remained slushy.   THen I realized, that I didn't really know if -20slushy salt water was any better at absorbing more heat that -20 pure ice.\n\nDamn....an experiment waiting to happen...\n", "prompt": "Modonpl387: Another Cheap Cooler I Made\n\nModonpl387: ok this is a two styrofoam stacked cooler with frozen salt water bottles wrapped in aluminum foil for conductivity and a box fan. it works well. the base of the top cooler and the lid of the bottom cooler have holes.", "orig": "the air goes into the first cooler and is cooled, it travels into the bottom cooler and is cooled more and comes out of vents out of the bottom cooler.  freeze bottles at night for cheaper electricity rates and be careful of water leaks and electrical cables.\n04221970: Why use salt water and not just regular water", "generated": "Modonpl387: Another Cheap Cooler I Made\n\nModonpl387: ok this is a two styrofoam stacked cooler with frozen salt water bottles wrapped in aluminum foil for conductivity and a box fan. it works well. the base of the top cooler and the lid of the bottom cooler have holes."}
{"full_text": "Hold423: I finally gave into the fact there is no free will. But then realized something more interesting.\nAfter fighting against it for so long, I have finally given in to the fact that there is no such thing as free will. I argued that you could never devise falsifiable experiment that would prove what happened could only have ever happened *that specific way.* But I was rebuffed by a fellow redditor that pointed out that if you could prove some things happened randomly, it would be a clear falsification of determinism.\n\nI dug through the interwebs looking for proof of randomness. Yes, random number generators spit out a \"random\" number, but there was a direct cause to the generation of said number. Radioactive decay? Not as random as scientists once thought. You can actually predict it using the [Law of Large Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Large_Numbers). According to the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, particles don't exist until observed. But even that is the result of a direct cause (the observation in the first place). Even if there is infinite causes to any effect, the effect is still a direct result of the cause.\n\nBut once I gave up and accepted that *random chance is impossible*, I realized something else: If randomness doesn't exist, then humanity, life, and earth were not the consequence of a random, meaningless process. In other words, if determinism completely eradicates random chance, the question, \"Why are we here?\", can no longer be answered, \"by chance.\"\n\nWe know that \"meaning\" exists. I keep my grandpa's purple heart in my desk because it is a meaningful representation of his life and service. We have *reasons* we love and hate people, and even if those reasons are already completely determined, the concept still exists. Therefore, \"meaning\" and \"reason\" had to exist in the very first moments of the universe because, *necessarily*, if you can understand the complete data set of the entire universe, you can predict everything.\n\nNow, the immediate argument will be: Life can still be meaningless. Just because humans possess meaning doesn't prove \"meaning\" existed before humanity existed. But I would argue that this doesn't make sense in a completely determinate world. Because if the universe is completely determined, everything that exists right now (including Meaning and Reason) existed in the very first moments. In other words, we could directly trace back every single cause to every meaningful event and reveal that \"meaning\" existed implicitly in those causes (because meaning was the effect).\n\nUltimately, though, randomness may be possible. There may be something I am over looking and free will and randomness may exist. If this is the case, then the universe definitely could exist simply because of chance. **But, If you accept that there is no free will and that our lives are the result of a completely determinate process, it can never make sense to answer the question \"Why?\" with the response \"by chance.\"**\n\nEDIT: I was conscious of the difference of meaning as cause and meaning as purpose when I wrote this. I am sorry if I wasn't clear. But the distinction really has little bearing on my argument. I will explain:\n\nIn the post, I tried to combine Determinism with [Bohm's Gnosis](http://www.bizcharts.com/stoa_del_sol/plenum/plenum_3.html) the idea that there is an implicate order underlying reality. Similar to Hegel's Phrenomenology and Frege's Theoroms, effects are not only the *result* of causes but they exist **implicitly in the causes themselves**. For example, Frege argues that not only does 2 + 2 result in the number 4. **He argues that 2+2 must inherently contain 4** otherwise how could we ever come to that answer? I was applying this logic to Determinism. Therefore, if *meaning as purpose* exists now, then it existed *implicitly at the very first moments of the universe*. If the Big Bang is 2+2 and meaning as purpose is 4, then meaning as purpose existed inherently within the Big Bang.\n\nNow, if you disagree that implicit truths exist, which is really the only argument people are making, then, yes, it doesn't follow that meaning as purpose existed at the first moments of the Big Bang. But then you get to the question that Frege struggled with throughout his whole career, if 4 doesn't inherently exist within 2+2, then you could not just say 2+2 = 4. Because if it's not inherently true, how else would you prove that 2+2 actually equals 4? Therefore, 4 *necessarily* has to exist within 2+2, or, meaning as purpose has to exist within the Big Bang.\nPunkndrublic: Well of course. When it all comes down to it there really isn't any chance. It's all a determined number of percentages and cause/causation.\n\n\nI might have missed the point entirely.\n[deleted]: We exist for a reason. ie. In a determined world, it doesn't make sense to say, \"life is meaningless.\"\nPunkndrublic: Oh. What's the reason?\n[deleted]: No idea. Maybe that will be the next post ;) Got any ideas?\njbleep: I agree with others that you have confused two uses of the word \u201cmeaning.\u201d Here is what you have said: the world is determinate and therefore the world is only causes and effects; which is equal to saying, the world is determinate and therefore the world is meaningful.\n\nAll that is fine. But you have said nothing, other than the world is determinate.\n\nIf you have accepted determinism, then to answer the question, \u201cwhat is the reason we exist\u201d look toward the disciplines of science, which take for their ground causality. You\u2019re not going to discover the reason (a totality of causes and effects) in any \u201cnext post.\u201d\n\nFinally, your second conclusion, that meaning existed at the beginning of the universe, stems from this confusion.\n\nI hope this clarification is of some help.\n\n[deleted]: &gt; Finally, your second conclusion, that meaning existed at the beginning of the universe, stems from this confusion.\n\nAre you familiar with Bohm's Implicate order, Hegel's Phenomenology, or Frege in general? Check out the edit.\njbleep: Your edit has made an enormous difference in the ability to interpret your initial post. I think I had completely misunderstood the proposition. However, for the sake of extinguishing any doubt, I will continue here.\n\nI now believe that you are saying that any concept which exists now must have also existed at the beginning of the universe, and always exists. Under this interpretation, the argument is reduced to whether abstractions of our environment describe a property, being, or becoming in the external environment.\n\nNow, I would completely buy the argument that because the sentiment regarding the Purple Heart exists now; it must have existed at the beginning of the universe\u2014in as much as the coding (or cause) for it was there. In effect, meaning was carried through each cause (I can buy the 2+2=4 argument here; however, this application sounds more like Nietzsche to me). Though, you additional assert that, \u201cWe exist for a reason. ie. In a determined world, it doesn't make sense to say, \u2018life is meaningless.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, if I understand your argument correctly, the meaning of life existed at the beginning of the universe, if it exists now, or at any time in the future. But since I am not convinced of any meaning of life now, and I don\u2019t invest time in speculation, I am yet to be convinced that a meaning of life existed at the beginning of the universe. And, anyway, what would that matter then\u2014we would understand the meaning of life!\n\nIf I am still on the wrong track and you wish to continue this development, I encourage you to clarify your argument.\n[deleted]: &gt; I now believe that you are saying that any concept which exists now must have also existed at the beginning of the universe, and always exists.\n\nGot it exactly!\n\n&gt; But since I am not convinced of any meaning of life now, and I don\u2019t invest time in speculation, I am yet to be convinced that a meaning of life existed at the beginning of the universe. And, anyway, what would that matter then\u2014we would understand the meaning of life!\n\nThis is a valid criticism. I selectively left this counter-argument out ;) I've been thinking about it, though, and all I can come up with is that it is exceptionalist to believe meaning as purpose to be solely a human phenomenon.\n\nFor instance, we know meaning as purpose existed alongside us in the very first moments of the creation of the universe (if you buy the 2+2 argument). Therefore, you would be falling into the trap of human exceptionalism if you said meaning as purpose exists only for us. And even if we don't have access to that meaning, it doesn't mean it can't exist.\n\nI know it's weak, but I'm working on it....\n", "prompt": "Hold423: I finally gave into the fact there is no free will.

{"full_text": "mhmughees: How can I fix my social mess?\nI am in early thirties, recently I realised that I do not have much social life. I have many colleagues or people who I see at work, I can easily do chitchat with them but none of them tend to be interested in inviting me or going further into friendship. This was the case during my school years where everyone would know me but no one was my friend. I should also mention here that I had a tough childhood and my mom didn\u2019t let me socialize outside too much to protect me from getting involved with bad kids. In short my childhood was very strict . How fast forward in adulthood , I still don\u2019t know how to many friends, I have lost most of friends because I am not a good friend( not sure how ) , when I go in social activities I feel I have to fake and pretend a lot so people can like me, because the things I am naturally into are not exciting to people. Like I am not into sports or hiking or tv shows , I like more deeper discussions. \n\nI know I need to fix my social life and start thinking positive about myself but I want to learn how to go from first initial talk to making deeper friendships. Currently I don\u2019t have a single person who can I call my actual friend.\nLiberaler: &gt;I feel I have to fake and pretend a lot so people can like me,\n\nMaybe you should change that strategy. If you never show your real self, there is no chance for authentic relationships.\n\n&gt;because the things I am naturally into are not exciting to people.\n\nWhatever these things are, there will be other people, who share your interests. Keep on looking til you find that people. Expose yourself to new social circles.\n\n\n&gt;I know I need to fix my social life and start thinking positive about myself but I want to learn how to go from first initial talk to making deeper friendships\n\nImho it's about exposing yourself to a lot of people, til you finally click with someone. This can only happen if you show your authentic self. To get to a deeper level, you have to ask more personal questions and reveal more personal thought/feelings.\nThis may be a little polarizing but is necessary.\nmhmughees: Thanks for your reply , my issue is that I used to show my true self ( I may be was toxic back then and used to compare myself to other a lot .. not sure ) but the result of showing my true self was most of my friends left me, many of them bullied me too. By the end of my bachelors I hardly had anyone I could call friends . Since then I worked a lot on myself to see why would they all wouldn\u2019t want me .. I realise that I had some toxic things , I also found that I tend to get attracted to wrong people for friends .. but mostly after that I become very cautious as I don\u2019t wanted people to again pulled away by my true self .. but now it\u2019s still the same , not many close friends , at least they don\u2019t hate me now as I control myself a lot but also not sure what to do from here\nLiberaler: That sound like you are already a self-reflective person. Don't look too much in the past. You probably changed a lot over the years. Also, potential friends are also older now and more developed socially and in their character.\n\nWhat aspect of your true self is so hard to accept for other people, if I may ask?\nmhmughees: Yes I am not sure what exact aspects annoy them but I always feel people tend to move away from me after initial good conversations . From my own analysis I found I tend to share too much , I have dark humour too so that may be another thing , I also do not realise when other wants to talk , I do get jealous also if someone is more successful/ better and in past I may have bitched about it ( I have changed it) also I found I lack social abilities about what to express and what not. For example if I don\u2019t like someone said soemthing I just bluntly say it or if I don\u2019t agree to something , I have noticed these things do set them off as I may come as very overly confident rude person\nLiberaler: My insight into your life and personality is very limited, but from the impression that I get, working on the following three aspects could help you:\n\n* Social fine-tuning: self-reflection is important, but you can only get social fine-tuning by putting yourself out there more. A lot of the fine-tuning are unconscious changes, you have no direct influence on. You can learn the theory about how to swim in an abstract way, but sooner or late you have to jump into the water. The best swimmers, are the ones, who swim the most. Solution: But yourself out there more and trust your ability to naturally grow more social.\n\n* self-acceptance: Know your value, even when others don't recognize it. No one is perfect in social settings, we all are humans with our unique flaws. Realize that you don't have to be perfect, to be liked and loved. Insecurity creates a negative feedback loop: You act insecure -&gt; other people sense that there is something in the air and act differently -&gt; you notice it and act even more insecure -&gt; repeat. You have to stop that dynamic from even starting by accepting yourself and the situation.\n\n* realize that not all has directly to do with you: A lot of people just don't look for a friend at the moment (e.g. time, stress, already have more social contacts going on, than they can handle). Or they just not in the right mood for some reason. That a friendship results from a conversation, will always be the exception, no matter who you are and how social you are. This is why you need to put yourself out there often to create many chances, until you finally click with someone.\n\nWish you the best!\nmhmughees: Hello thanks for giving me concrete points I really admire it because I work much better with points .. but one question I have it that usually I found my colleagues or classmates , batch mates could make friends with ease , like we will meet at some social events at same time and next thing I know is that bunch of them are now close friends to each other while I am still in small talk phase ( not because I don\u2019t want but just most people keep me in that phase mostly even when I tend to share about myself or ask them about themselves ) so is it really true for everyone that friendship is rare outcome\nLiberaler: When I referred to friendship, I was aiming at deep and long-lasting contacts. Friendships that last for years and decades. That have real substance and are not replaceable. These are always somewhat rare. But one can learn and become better in forming deeper connections/bonds.\n\nSuperficial friendships, normally not that long-lasting, are easier to form, especially for people, that are more aligned to the mainstream culture (not meant judgmental). For people that are sensitive and/or introverted, it is harder to create these relationships, that are more on the superficial side. But when they find the right kind of people people, their counterparts, their friendships thrive and are among the deepest and longest-lasting ones.\n\nA lot of people are in a way lazy and just stick with the first people they encounter, even if the connection is not super deep. From that perspective having it harder is an advantage, because it forces you to keep on looking, to movie forward and work on yourself.\nmhmughees: Okay thanks that makes sense but still I personally have noticed that something in my personality turn people off , it could be that I over share , or I am out spoken or May be I am generally not that agreeable person, I tend to disagree on many things , so may be this sets them off but at this stage of my life I have hardly 2-3 people who I can even count as friends , mostly I am alone with no one wanting to hangout with me\n", "prompt": "mhmughees: How can I fix my social mess?\nI am in early thirties, recently I realised that I do not have much social life.

{"full_text": "tristanhelean: Why am I so emotionally unavailable?\nFor context, I'll give a brief history of my past.\n\n\nThroughout junior high and high school I was a very loving guy. I always 'fell in love' with girls for long periods of time, and I'm OCD so I would very much obsess over them. I would completely disregard any negative factors about the girl/situation/my chances, and hopelessly dream of spending time with them in a romantic way.\n\nOne specific example is a girl I'll call M. \nM is the last girl that I liked, the last girl I was emotionally open to.\n\nM and I had known each other for about two years, but never spent that much time together until I made my way into her life. \n\nTime with her was all laughter, smiles and good memories. One neighborhood away, I was at her house almost everyday and I snuck out most nights to see her as well. Conversations with her easily flowed, and made me happy, we texted each other a lot. \n\nI was very close to her family, as I was in their house so much. They weren't the best of parents.. so they provided us with a lot of weed and alcohol. 75% of time spent with M was stoned, leading me to believe my feelings for her were heightened due to the euphoria.\n\nAlthough we were so close, she could never see me in a romantic way. Completely one sided on my part, so 8 months of happiness was shattered when I told her how I felt. She actually hasn't talked to me since.\n\nSo let's make a list of past traits:\n\n-Obsessive\n-laughter and enjoyable moments\n-great effort to spend time with her\n-texting buddies\n-butterflies\n-love (?)\n\n\n\nWell, I (obviously) didn't achieve any romance with any of the other girls and I realized this after M. A lonely summer of reflection led me to believe that emotions were a waste of effort, a waste of time, and pointless. I was being clingy and desperate, so I sought a change.\n\nI decided to cut off anyone I liked, and prevent myself from wasting my time once again, making sure I didn't feel any obsessive desires for girls like I had in the past.\n\nI regret this dearly now.\n\nI liked M three years ago, and I haven't liked anybody after her. I try to talk to people romantically but it's the other way around now, it's one sided in their direction. I feel nothing towards anybody, the butterflies have left my belly. The girls I talk to blatantly tell me that I'm very closed off and emotionally distant, and it depresses me. \n\nI want to know how to gain my ability to love back! I want to obsess over somebody again. Everything in this world is either equally valuable, or equally worthless, and I need to find value in others again.\n\n\n\ntl;dr: I used to be a loving guy, but after years of rejection I closed myself off. I feel nothing for others anymore and want to find out how to turn my emotions back on.\nneon53295: Emotions won't be turned on. Do not try to fight your emotional state, but do exert yourself to change your way of thinking.\n\nGo read about chakras, and try out meditation to help you.\n\nThe thing most likely to establish new ways of thinking is to meet new people.\n\nPS: Always remember what you want.\n\nLife is like a simulation. You are your own main character,, going through personal growth.\n\nMy current state regarding emotions: I'm turning 17, and I like a few girls. Each of them I only like because they seem like a puzzle piece that can fit in with my life, and I judge their suitability. I sortof have a faith that my life will one day be beautiful, I cannot comprehend being ultimately unhappy. If it were otherwise, then I don't want to live, its a bit like if a=b then b=a, therefor a and b must be true (can't be proven, so fuck it let's make it true; this is the logic of parralel universes).\n\nHave a (link)[https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5t3m8p/if_suicide_and_the_commitment_to_live_are_equally/].\n\nAlso, the 'coin flip' is a good way of making hidden emotions more concrete. Assign heads/tails to 'live your life without emotion' and vice-versa. Flip it, but don't look (or *do*, whatever). Your subconcious should have made a truthful decision on what you truly wish to fight for, and this might be much more clear (like, clear enough to modify your habitual way of thinking. Also, the event associated with it or even just typing what you did should also have this effect).\n\nBut like I said, new [better, loving] people is the best way to solidify the state you wish to be in. I go to a youth, and I love it there. I love pretty much everyone there, whereas most people at school can just die. (Tune: drowning pool - [let the] bodies [hit the floor])\n\nUhh...\n\nOh one more thing. This will take a while. I got screwed up in gr7, I feel I've only gotten back to normal recently gr11. We constantly change due to a lot of factors. Go read about chaos theory. Stay vigilant.\n\n\"Only when you jump into the storm and realise that you are fully in control of your movements, will you realise that you are in control of your life.\"\n\nSomething to keep in mind for the future.\n\nAaaaand I hope I'm not just talking shit.

{"full_text": "DevilsintheBeetails: people make rude comments about my cooking\nOk so here it goes. I prepped breakfast meals ahead of time so I could spend time with some of my partners family/friends. I made pancakes and frittatas. The frittatas were I guess kind of moist and my partner's bro called them like \"grease balls\". I thought it was kind of rude and asked if he thought they tasted bad and he said they were fine but the comment stuck out to me. \n\nTo be honest my partner does this as well. I try to not let it get to me but it does. \n\nMy partner used to judge my food and compare it to restaurants and would critique it. If he didn't like it he would always tell me why or tell me why he wasn't finishing it. Honestly, it started to get to me because I never felt like there was anything I could make that he liked. He would tell me to make liptons soup for him which he said I made well (it's boiling water). I finally told him, if he doesn't like it, to not tell me and just not eat it. He rarely eats what I make.\n\nIt makes me really sad cause I had a past partner who always made me feel good about my cooking. Now, I guess I'm starting to realise that my cooking is maybe not that great. It's \"edible\". It sucks cause I always thought I was a good cook and I like the food I make...\n\nThis morning I finally said to my partner, if he doesn't like it he should make something himself. But then we always go eat fast food instead and I find it gross and unhealthy. \n\nNot sure what to do or think here.\nmonk_ty: It could be that you\u2019re alright at cooking, but your partner just doesn\u2019t like it. Him saying it\u2019s bad doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re a bad cook, but I can see how the difference in reaction about your food can be demoralizing. \n\nIs preparing your own food out of the question? Like he gets what he wants and you cook your own food?\nDevilsintheBeetails: Yeah. This is what I normally do. Honestly it just feels saddening because like I'll make a lasagna and I end up eating most of it (like 90%). And each time I eat it I say to myself that \"it tastes good to me I don't get why he doesn't like it?\".\n\n That and I get a lot of joy from people enjoying my food. It's been a really long time since someone really told me they loved my cooking. There was an older man I met the other day who reminded me of my ex and it just filled me with sadness because I broke up with him after my dad died and I did it in a bad way. He was a good person and in the end it was amicable, but i felt like I really wronged him and sometimes I wish I had stayed or wondered what it would have been like to have stayed. He didn't deserve my leaving him like that. Anyways, that's over now and I wouldn't try to have him back in my life again, it would be wrong.l and disrespectful. The point is, he was always so positive about my cooking and I remember feeling like I was really improving as a cook at that time. I miss that.\n\nMy mom never really taught me cooking, I guess she wanted to be the one to cook for everyone and I kind of had to pick it up in my twenties. Like I'm not a chef, but i didn't think my food was just \"edible\". I don't think I want to serve these particular people again but like, I feel like if I stop cooking around them, I let their negativity towards my cooking win. Maybe I shouldnt take the lead when it comes to cooking and just buy ready-made food. It just feels like, how can this food prepared at the grocery store be better than what I make? Maybe I'm just being too sensitive and just need to try to not let it bother me.\nmonk_ty: When your partner critiques it, does he actually say what he doesn\u2019t like about it? Or does he just say it\u2019s bad? Some things really are just a personal preference thing, so you shouldn\u2019t take that personally (easier said than done I know). I\u2019m not saying he shouldn\u2019t be appreciative of you cooking btw, but if he tells you what he doesn\u2019t like about it then it may take the confusion out of why he doesn\u2019t like it. If he\u2019s just saying it\u2019s bad then that\u2019s rude and annoying imo. \n\nIf you really want him to like it then maybe you could try experimenting with his critique notes? Also, does your partner know how much you enjoy cooking? Maybe telling him that it helps to know what he likes about your cooking could work too? \n\nAlso, the point about letting their negativity win was interesting to me. I can tell you enjoy cooking, but the people you serve to isn\u2019t as receptive as you\u2019d like and it\u2019s making you feel bad. I don\u2019t think not serving them food anymore is a matter of \u201cletting negativity win\u201d but moreso keeping your sanity and your love for cooking alive. You take pride in your food, but I\u2019m worried that too much pride is gonna make you hate cooking altogether.\n\nI\u2019m just throwing some thoughts and ideas out there. I hope it helped a little\nDevilsintheBeetails: Thanks for that. Yeah he would be specific - but honestly, I felt like sometimes when the meal was pretty much perfect and to his liking, he would find something (kind of like it was under-seasoned, or the onions weren't cut small enough, or it would be the wrong texture). Honestly, it would be really unfortunate because I'd spend like an hour making a really nice potato and broccoli soup, but he would say the texture was wrong and it shouldn't have been blended. But, you know, it took a long time and I thought it tasted great so I didn't appreciate the notes. \n\nSo I was just honest with him that his critiques were too focused on perceived mistakes and negations. I asked him to find something he liked about the meal to comment on because I was getting very discouraged. And it really bothered me because he would get breakfast sandwiches from fast food places and eat those no problem but had a problem with my breakfast sandwiches even though I definitely make good breakfast sandwiches (although there's no way of you knowing that). \n\nAnyways, little tangent there. So....basically I told him if he doesn't have something good to say about it, to not tell me. And not announce that he's not going to eat it, just not eat it. \n\nIt felt like, even if I made the meal exactly to his specifications, he would find something. And I started to resent him for basically sitting down and acting like a food critic at meals. I think someone else here said it well when they talked about appreciation. If I'm working hard in the kitchen to prepare something and it's good enough, I don't want to hear what's wrong with it. I take notes but the notes eventually have to stop. The amount of times I heard \"this is great\" with no side notes was very little. \n\n\nSo I was honest with him about that and he has been better. He won't eat the food but I don't ask about it. And I try not to get upset when he says my \"boxed\" fish sticks and bag of wedges is good. He does say I make good potatoes so at least there's that. \n\nBut you're right. I want to keep my love of food alive and sometimes that passion is underappreciated in certain areas and I just need to consider that.\nmonk_ty: You\u2019ve tried to take his critiques and work with them, and you\u2019ve told him how you felt. Him being overly nitpicky about your cooking sounds exhausting tbh. If you\u2019re not asking for critiques then you shouldn\u2019t have to sit through them every meal. He doesn\u2019t have to like your cooking, but he also doesn\u2019t have to be a jerk. I don\u2019t know your life but there must be someone in your life who would love to eat your cooking and be happy about it.

However, when I transferred units (still in the same hospital) I noticed that no body seemed to care. There was no card like usual, no brunch party for the next morning, just nothing really. I worked there three years and that was that. They bought a box of cookies and wrote inside the box we'll miss you, which is something.

I have a limited number of friends as it is that I may see a couple times a year, and because I work in nursing I feel  making new friends is even more difficult. One girl must have seen I was on the group chat and facetimed me on the spot which I rejected because I was just sitting on the couch with my girlfriend at 10pm. I guess that means something?

This reminds me of a fairly recent question regarding adding OAC progressions to the RR - similarly, the answer was, if you have any business doing that, the RR doesn't apply to you anymore.\n\nPPL (if not just upper lower) is fairly popular for intermediates around here, and is often split even further into straightarm/bentarm. I do PPL, which starts to look like a lift-focus powerlifting program where I hammer a skill and then do a bunch of assistance volume. Splits are frowned upon for beginners, yeah, because they really don't need them yet (necessary workload isn't high enough to make full-body sessions super long and tiring, motor skills and 3x/week frequency are most important), but splits for more advanced trainees is just a fact of practical necessity that isn't subject to our opinions/culture here.\nWolfeyRages: When would you say someone is due for a split? Ive been on the routine for almost half a year now and I'm up to 60% bodyweight max dip and around 30% bodyweight added for 6 reps on pull-up to give a rough idea \npumpasaurus: You can't really base it on strength - it's mainly how your progress has been, and what your goals are. \n\nBasically, if you are still getting results, then you have the luxury of being able to choose whatever training structure you want. A full-body routine is the most time-efficient and usually involves the least amount of total work.\n\nIf you stall out and stop making any progress, and you're not feeling totally beat up (deload necessary), then the culprit is not doing enough work. Adding work might still allow a full-body routine, but the more work you do, the more sense it makes to split up the workouts so that you can focus and put the work in without having super long sessions.\nWolfeyRages: I'm able to progress strength wise, it just only seems to work with low reps high intensity \npumpasaurus: That's a good place to be.\n\nIf higher volume doesn't work for you, there's two reasons why: first, it's always less direct to train max strength in any way other than just directly progressing your intensity with higher weights (what you're doing), and as long as you can do it, you should - second, if you never do higher volume, your work capacity is probably fairly low, so you'd need to get used to higher volume in the first place for it to work.\n\nEventually the low-reps-high-intensity approach will stall out (unless you're a freak with great potential and you kind of achieve all your goals before it becomes necessary to mess with periodization and volume manipulation, which does happen), and it will require just adding extra work in order to have the body recognize that there's something happening that requires it to adapt.\nWolfeyRages: I definitely have low muscular endurance, I can't do more than 8 unweighted pull-ups which I will focus on for hypertrophy when the time comes, but for now I will take advantage of the low rep, hopefully it doesn't stall out before I achieve a few goals, but if it does atleast I know what I need to do, thanks \n", "prompt": "[deleted]: Looking at the RR, what about periodisation?\n[deleted]\npumpasaurus: The RR is a beginner program, taking you through your first &lt;1 year of training and building a base of body control and fundamental strength - if you need periodization and splits to progress, you're", "orig": "not a beginner and the RR isn't for you anymore.

All their passion to make the world a better place withered? The claim that the professors cost their universities more in health benefits, while true, is a pretty sad justification.\n\nTruth is, you can find narratives and examples supporting both schools of thought on mandatory retirement and the cushiness of tenure (the protection of the professor I believe essential to the field). Generally, I think the idea of making more jobs by retiring old people who still want to work is the wrong philosophy for the idea of a \"job\".

Best would be if professors after 70 had their salaries paid by an outside (government?) source to retain them but free up money for new hires. But then that's the same as any solution: we need more money towards education.\nBirthDeath: &gt;Why did it suddenly become selfish when they turned 70? All their passion to make the world a better place withered? The claim that the professors cost their universities more in health benefits, while true, is a pretty sad justification.\n\nIt's not that once that hit a certain age it becomes selfish, but once you choose to stop being productive as a tenured professor, it is hard to justify your salary.  One of the main problems that I have with tenure is that after it is granted, unless an individual has external motivations (advancement, salary increases, pride, desire to be an authority in the field, etc), there is no way to compel them to work.  \n\nI know plenty of tenured professors in my department who advise no students, never attend seminars, don't keep up with contemporary research, perform no department service, and teach 2-3 classes per year.  They could easily be replaced by an Adjunct Professor or lecturer who would make a fraction of their salary with little to no dropoff in quality.  \n\nThat said, I know plenty of professors in their late 60s and 70s who are still extremely productive and tremendous assets to their departments.  I also don't think it's fair to force someone who didn't get a tenure track position until they were in their 40s to retire at 70.  \n\nAgain, this goes back to the fact that tenure gives lifetime employment based on someone's early career productivity, with no guarantee or any sort of incentive to ensure that this productivity will continue.  This is a huge financial commitment, leading to the disturbing trend of tenure lines being retired and instead hiring adjunct and non-tenure track faculty.         \n\nI think that the best solution is to guarantee tenure for a fixed term, say 20-25 years.  After this term expires, they can apply for tenure again (with relaxed standards).  If they choose not to, they assume emeritus status at 50-75% of their salary with minimal teaching and research obligations.  \nsinisterstarr: Wow, I really like your last paragraph! Perhaps the fixed term of tenure could be further compromised as simply set at age 70. Then you reapply for tenure again or get shunted to a reduced-salary tenure/emeritus stage.\n\nIt's for productivity's sake that I don't enjoy forced retirement (my father is  a very productive electrical engineer at 72), but tenure throws all that off-balance. However, it does that the moment it's granted, not when the professor turns 70.\n\nI've heard very good arguments that tenure protects professors who want to make bold claims without risk of departmental or political reprisal. I feel that's really important for a job about thinking. I know professors can go lazy, but I have to say that tenure is a sweet, sweet ride and everyone knows it. There is high competition for those positions and the ten or twenty year career path before tenure (hello international post-docs for years on end!). I feel that's got to be pretty good at making sure only super-passionate people get tenure. If one out of ten of those professors were just being awesome so they could rest easy, it's a small price for the other nine passionate geniuses we just hired.\nBirthDeath: &gt;I know professors can go lazy, but I have to say that tenure is a sweet, sweet ride and everyone knows it.

If one out of ten of those professors were just being awesome so they could rest easy, it's a small price for the other nine passionate geniuses we just hired.\n\nThat's definitely true, and I think that in the current climate, one has to put in so much effort to get tenure that it is highly unlikely that they will suddenly stop caring once they receive it (unless they just burn out).  \n\nHowever, 20-30 years ago, when mandatory retirement was still in place, tenure standards were a lot more lax.  Some professors who were granted tenure during that era at elite colleges would not even receive tenure at a much less prestigious school in today's climate.  I know of professors who were granted tenure in the 1970's with zero publications and no postdoc. I don't know how that is even possible.\n", "prompt": "marquis_of_chaos: The Forever Professors\n\nsinisterstarr: &gt;\"If they do remain on the job, they should at least openly acknowledge they\u2019re doing it mostly for themselves.\"\n\nWhy did it suddenly become selfish when they turned 70?

It will build strength better.\nGrisnak: &gt; Some background: I used to do pole vault and gymnastics in high school but then grades 11 and 12 saw me geting into warcraft and gaining several pounds. I was fairly obese, at 245 going into University. I cut that down in the last three years to about 180 now and have been getting into body weight exercises for the last 8 or so months. Got a pull up bar and been bustin em out every day along with chin ups and front lever progressions. Read parts of Christopher Sommer's \"Building the Gymnastic Body\" and got rings for my doorframe pull up bar exactly a month ago. Been having lots of fun with em :P \n\nMy goal (well goals really) at this point are to be able to do a full planche, front lever, and back lever while cutting down some body fat%. I'm hovering at ~180 lbs and hoping to bring it to maybe 172-175. I've been doing lots of ring and bar work too for fat loss coupled with squat variations. Wind up working up quite a sweat with said dynamic movements. I got narrow L sit muscle ups down 3 weeks ago after 4 or so days of trying (forced to do L sit due to narrow door frame). \n\nI figure that with the right calorie deficient diet and progression training I'll be able to hopefully lose fat and achieve a planche, just looking for a few pointers on well rounded routines to those ends really :P Every person I've seen who can do a planche has had an incredibly toned midsection. I figured progressing to a planche would mean that by the time I was finally able to do one, my metabolism would have compensated and cut down fat in general due to the way the whole body is used in it.

So why is it fading?\n\nfpssledge: Because people differ on solutions to better the lifestyles of poor people.  Redistribution of wealth is simply an idea.  Some people don't see themselves and victims of some form of theft.  And no, they don't consider themselves not-yet-millionaires.  That's just a joke.  They simply believe there are other ways to advance their own selves in this economy.  Some of it is based on principle.  Some of that is based on ethics.  Some of that is based on understanding of economics, and whether or not redistribution would even accomplish it's goals.\nmors_videt: I am very interested in the idea that law is written to benefit the rich. Society, including law, should present a level field. There is reason to believe that this is highly unequal and I agree that it should be corrected.\n\nI am offended by the idea of direct redistribution through unequal taxation. I view this as theft.\nUmezete: Graduated taxes are the only fair taxes, at least when it comes to income taxes.\n\nWe also need to address corporate tax laws as they pay a fraction of a fraction of their fair share.\nmors_videt: What does the word \"fair\" mean in that statement?\n\nIf you and I go out to dinner, and you have twice my income, should you pay twice what I pay for the bill?\nUmezete: That isn't how graduated tax works, please look it up and read the definition.\nmors_videt: If you and I go out to dinner and you have twice my income, should you pay a larger percentage of the bill in proportion to what you actually ate than I do?\n\nAlso, being condescending doesn't improve your argument or attack my basic proposition, even if my math was imprecise.\nUmezete: If by bill you mean taxes, then yes.\n\nBut again graduated tax is based on tiers, your income is taxed same as mine till a point, then its taxed a bit more till the next point then more still.  Its a way to be sure to place the tax burden on the wealthy who already are financially stable while being fair.\n\nThe problem I have with your \"argument,\" is its an extremely dangerous oversimplification of how taxes should work.  They aren't a commodity, they are the cost of citizenship and I utterly think that yes people who benefit more from that deserve to pay more.\nmors_videt: By \"benefit more\" you mean \"receive increased marginal utility from infrastructure\"?\nUmezete: Okay you are strawmaning like a motherfucker here.\n\nThe problem is we should have real benefits like universal healthcare, quality education, actual quality infrastructure, social security, and more but the fuckers at Washingtion refuse to function.  One of the core issues is our tax laws  vastly benefit corporate and the top 1% and put too much burden on the middle class.  Its extremely damaging since it underfunds funding civil services and its extremely damaging to the economy because those middle class consumers are the lifeblood of it.\n\nI left the country because this is a bad joke, the only reason I'd come back is to politically rally for change.\nmors_videt: &gt; Okay you are strawmaning like a motherfucker here.\n\nBuddy, you don't know who I am and I don't know who you are. We are voices on the internet.\n\nI am interested in understanding other points of view, which is why I bothered to talk to you in the first place. My assumption about the word \"fair\" is that it would apply to a flat tax or a tax based on consumption. That's where I am coming from. I am interested in your use of \"fair\" as opposed to \"practical\" to defend graduated taxation, which see as inherently unfair.\n\nThe argument from marginal utility is one common way that \"fairness\" is defended for graduated taxes.\n\nYou, on the other hand, seem like you want to have an argument, which is not interesting to me. I already know what I think, and getting to type it at you, while you type what you think at me with neither one of us listening does not benefit or interest me.\n\nRegarding what you have actually written, I see you appealing to the practical benefit of social services and the practical benefit of funding them through unequal taxation, but I do not see you defending the use of the word \"fair\" in this context.\n\nI'm not interested in arguing, but I am interested in understanding your point of view. Can you explain your use of the word \"fair\" to describe placing a heavier proportionate tax burden on some people for the benefit of other people? \n\n\nUmezete: ....  I really am trying extremely hard to explain this.\n\nTaxes are a civic duty shared by every citizen of a country.\n\nForcing equal taxes across the board is unfair because many of the poor would not be able to function. \n\nA graduated tax system is therefore implemented.  (The US already has one btw, its just the taxes on the the top have been cut back severely and most importantly disproportionately.  In fact if you count assets and not income the uberwealthy pay less than the middle class\n)\n\nThis is based off the principle of the burden of funding government needs to be paid by those who benefit the most from the regime.  The game is already obv in their favor as they have the money to get into the higher tier.\n\nNow another reason why its fair is it works in tiers.  Its like reddit upvotes, up to the first tier all the money you make is yours, past that you get .9, past that .8, and so on and so on.\n\nThis is true for every single citizen.\nmors_videt: When I said a flat tax, what I meant was a flat percentage, not a fixed amount, so I don't agree that poor people would be unable to pay a percentage of income.\n\nI do know how graduated taxes work in America.\n\nI agree that cost should be payed by those who benefit. I agree that the socio-economic system of America seems to disproportionately benefit the wealthy. I disagree that this should be addressed through taxes because I think this is caused by unequal governmental representation and I would prefer to remove the problem at its source. Correcting unfair laws with other, counter-unfair, laws (I'm still calling unequal taxation unfair here) is unappealing to me.\n\nGetting back to your definition of \"fair\" though, you seem to define \"fair\" as meaning that everyone is provided for. Is that right? If \"fair\" just meant that people pay for what they use, than a purely consumption based tax would be fair, right?\nUmezete: I know you meant flat percent.\n\nAll evidence points that this doesn't work as well as a graduated tax.\n\nHow exactly do you prefer to deal with inequality?  How do you propose to remove the problem at its source?  In your world what is the problem even then?\n\nThe issue is its nice to say such things but ultimately they such remain unsubstantial.  Meanwhile the top .01% are slowly grinding the country to the ground by siphoning off too much weath.  \n\nIf you want to get to my real opinion on why graduated tax is fair its going to involve what your opinion of the social contract should be.  Personally at this point I don't think making tax laws work will be enough.

Once you get those off you'll likely find the metal speaker mounts screwed in directly to the box. Honestly though those speakers do look rather cheap and fixing them probably isn't worth the trouble. I would look around for new speakers instead, but that's just me. Either way, good luck!\n2LateImDead: Thanks for the response.  I wish I could get new speakers (I posted on some free stuff subs asking just a few minutes ago), but I've got no money to do so.  Either someone gives them to me or I manage to fix what I've got, else I've got nothing to work with.  :/\n\nIf I pry the grill off without damaging it, would normal superglue be good enough to put them back on so they don't look like crap?\njonvon65: Ahh, I see. The issue isn't getting the speakers open as much as fixing the blown drivers themselves. I haven't heard many success stories of blown drivers being restored. The only spare speakers I have are little mid rangers from my car (one of them pops when turned too loud but otherwise works fine). I would send them to you but they're 2.75 inches in diameter which is a lot smaller than the ones you have. Normal superglue probably wouldn't adhere that well to the front grills because it's a little too thin. Thicker glue like hot glue or gorilla glue would be better for this situation.\n2LateImDead: I might be able to get some Gorilla glue if it's even fixable.  Probably isn't though, like you said.  Thanks for the offer of those speakers from your car.  I'm pretty sure they're actually about the size of these ones - I shone a light through the mesh to look inside and these things are like 90% casing, the speaker inside is fairly small.  I don't have any exact measurements, though.\n\nDo you have an estimate of how much it'd cost to mail them?  I live in Virginia.  I don't really have any money because my job sucks and I'm going through college and supporting myself, but I could skip paying my phone bill this month to cover shipping costs, potentially.  But I can't imagine they'd be huge, even shipping from Asia is normally no more than $10, if it's something reasonably small.\njonvon65: Honestly, don't worry about the shipping, I've got you covered. I'm testing them out right now and they're not half bad. Also they're just bare speakers and I'd like to put them in an enclosure of some sort before I ship them. What would you be hooking them up to?\n2LateImDead: I've got an old Sony amplifier that uses the basic black and red speaker wires to hook things up.  It's also got RCA (yellow-white-red, minus the yellow since it's just audio) outputs and inputs.  I've got an AUX-RCA adapter to input sound.  I've never used the RCA outputs but I'm under the impression that they'd work the same, so whatever is easiest for you.\n\nThanks a bunch, by the way.  I've been really stressed about not having any speakers.  I'll still need to find more, but getting back 2 when I lost 4 cuts the loss in half, which is a big help.  And even 2 is enough to get back to practicing and recording.  :)\n\nI'll send you a PM with my address.\njonvon65: Ahh ok, good, that makes it easy then! Of course, just letting you know beforehand that these speakers are good quality but they are rather small, you won't be pissing off the neighbors with them. That being said, just don't turn them up too loud and you should be fine. I'll start on building the enclosures tomorrow and hopefully I can get them shipped out to you sometime this week.

The book is full of internal dialogue that reveals brand new plot details. Let me give you an example from the book, from the first chapter about Danaery's:\n\n&gt;\"No,\" Dany said meekly. \n\n&gt; Her brother smiled. \"Good.\" He touched her hair, almost with affection. \"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.\" \n\n&gt; When he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo's manse. \n\n&gt; Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. Her brother had a simpler name. \"Our land,\" he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. \"Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.\" \n\n&gt; And perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These p laces he talked of, Casterly Rock and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. Viserys had bee n a boy of eight when they fled King's Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother's womb . \n\n&gt;Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship's black sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of King 's Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper's dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar's heir was rip ped from her breast and murdered before her eyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while t he Kingslayer opened Father's throat with a golden sword. \n\n&gt; She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her. \n\n&gt; She did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper's brother set sail with his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast. \n\n&gt; She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, halfblind, roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called her \"Little Princess\" and sometimes \"My Lady,\" and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his bed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money the y had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever. \n\n&gt;They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper's hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one. \n\n&gt; At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and t he Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother's crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called her brother \"the beggar king.\" Dan y did not want to know what they called her. \n\n&gt; \"We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,\" he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it. \"The jewels and the silks, Dragon stone and King's Landing, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back.\" Viserys lived for that day. All that Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the childhood she had never known. \n\n&gt; There came a soft knock on her door. \"Come,\" Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio's servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister's many Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was Illyrio's favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked.\n\n\nExplain how they can \"act\" all of that out in the seconds between one word and the next in this scene: http://www.metacafe.com/watch/8362101/viserys_checks_daenerys/\nthatsgirlstuff: Well, obviously they can't do that. I thought I was commenting on the difference between the consensual sex and the rape sex in the book/show, respectively. Sorry if there was confusion.\nNorseGod: But if you read the scene - and play the show - they play out almost completely identically; except they cut the show right before Cersei goes along with it in the books. Right after he \"forces\" himself on her, she goes along with it. We end up realizing that this is their dynamic. Cersei is a woman so surrounded by enemies she has her walls up permanently. The only way anyone can get to her is by breaking past those walls. In effect, Cersei will never outright consent to the act, Jaime has to take her. She will only ever \"consent\" emotionally to her brother because he pushes her into it. There are lots of couples that are like this. The idea that the only \"good\" sex is one where both parties 100% verbally consent before anything happens is extremely niave and sad.\nthatsgirlstuff: Yeah, I don't have an opinion on that. Just think the show is a lot of talking and it can be really over the top. \n", "prompt": "Quouar: Rape of Thrones - The dangers of adaptation\n\nxeltius: It's not a big deal.

Perfectly even handed coverage, equality dream come true.\nsampjennings: And you can't think of a legitimate reason why an LGBT magazine might mention his sexuality?\nVariableVeritas: Yeah easy. They legitimately want to exist as a publication and make revenue from that existence in order to support their staff and their families. So they need to look specifically for achievements by people who are gay or trans or bi or anything other then Cis I guess so they can take some communal ownership of those achievements via the publishing. Then they get views from their target community, and the associated ad revenue. Also as an aside they get to feel good about themselves, strong motivations for anyone. Also the same motivations as any other publication, regardless of sexual orientation by the way.\nsampjennings: And you don't think that maybe - just maybe - there's positive benefits to members of a community highlighting achievements of other members of that community?  That maybe those people just want to highlight those achievements for other reasons than your hyper-cynical, hyper-negative view of them going after clicks and ad revenue?\n[deleted]: As a bisexual person who actually disagrees with you, I think the article reeks of \"see what you too can do, little bisexual people\". I am like yeah...never fucking doubted it thanks. My sexuality and my brain power/scientific ability have sod all to do with each other. \n\nMy sexuality isn't a big deal. I would resent being a publications poster boy, so they could get second hand glory off my scientific achievements, when literally the only thing I had in common with them is that I have sex with people!\n\nEdit: maybe it depends on the country a person lives in though. Being bi is boringly normal in the scientific community in my country, so I doubt a magazine would appropriate scientific achievements as their own, just because they have the same sexuality. It would be weird!\nsampjennings: Then you're probably just not the kind of person lgbtqnation is speaking to\n[deleted]: Obviously not. I would also really object to them appropriating my achievements as representing anything other than...my achievements! Having the same sexuality doesn't give fellow bi people any ownership over them.\nsampjennings: I don't see how this is appropriating the achievements of anyone, it's just highlighting members of a community who do big things.  Other magazines and publications for minority communities do the same thing, it helps people get encouraged to think of their community as contributing to the world.  Besides, it's just a small feel good article.  All this negativity needs to go away.\n[deleted]: Several reasons: The sexuality of the man is irrelevant to his achievements. This isn't an area like the NFL where it would be groundbreaking for an openly non-straight person to win things. It's science. The walls have been shattered long ago in terms of sexuality, to the point that sexuality of scientists is now totally irrelevant. Given that it's irrelevant, as I bi person, I would resent it being made a big deal of. \"Person with perfectly normal sexuality within the range of human sexualities wins a Nobel prize\" DOES sound kind of boring though, I admit. \n\nAlso, the implication that the man is part of a \"community\" instead of just living his life, is a fairly big one. I don't know any LGBTQ+ people who identify as being part of a community due to their sexuality. They view that as old fashioned. We are just living our lives and happen to be non-straight. We are no longer flocking together simply due to who we sleep with. We are friends for other reasons who happen to not be straight. Our achievements have nothing to do with some \"community\". We are friends, family, colleagues and neighbours. That's our community. Not one based on who we want to sleep with. Again, maybe it's country specific but not being straight is really no big deal where we are. It's just normal.\nsampjennings: His sexuality and the fact that he's achieving are perfectly relevant to a publication partially built to celebrate the achievements of people with that sexuality.\n[deleted]: I get that. I am simply saying that for me personally, I would be pissed off, because I feel we have moved past the point where being LGBTQ+ is something out of the ordinary. And therefore, I would object to being reduced to my very ordinary sexuality, as if it is something unusual or worthy of mention more than a straight person's would be. \n\nIn hindsight though, I realise this depends on the country you live in and the people you are surrounded by. 20 years ago, this would have been the sort of article run in LGBTQ+ publications in my country. Not so much now, as the man's achievements have nothing to do with his sexuality.\nsampjennings: I'd be pissed off if a science publication highlighted that I was gay or bi or trans rather than focusing on the research, maybe even if a general news outlet did, but this is literally an lgbt site\n[deleted]: I suppose so. I just feel like being non-hetero is normal, and I wonder when we start marginalising ourselves by highlighting our sexualities as if they are unusual? It feels reductive in a way. If the article talked about barriers in science and gave him as an example of achievement then that's different. But this feels like \"yay, look what someone can achieve EVEN IF they are bi\". Which offends me.\nsampjennings: I suppose you could see it that way but I just do not think it is reasonable to look at it like that\n[deleted]: Well I guess we will have to agree to disagree.

{"full_text": "KittyJ: In your face AutoParts Store Guy!\nBackground: My husband's car had a giant rust hole. He hadn't had time to fix it, and we didn't have $200 laying around to take it to a body shop. I know cars, and I'm an artist, I figured I'd do the repair and gain some serious wife points with the husband.\n\nI went into an auto parts store, they asked if I needed help, and I explained the issue and my plan to fix it. They were happy to suggest products... until I let it slip that I was planning to do the repair, not my husband. \nThe guy did a 180. He actually put the product he was recommending back on the shelf. Told me that the $150 or $200 to have it done professionally wasn't that much more, since the materials would cost at least $50, and that it would \"last longer\" if they did it. But the part that made up my mind was when he said that a repair shop would do the \"exact same thing [I was] talking about doing, but [they would] *do it right*\".\n\nWell, **challenge accepted**!\n\nI went to a different parts store and got what I needed.\n\nHere you can see the before and after pics of my repair, and a link to my blog on how I did it.

The work you did, while it may eventually break down, should last plenty long enough. The wire mesh you used was a good idea and will help. Next time you should knock out as much rust as possible, seal that area with a good rust preventative paint, hell even rustoleum basic rattle can would work. Then do your body work. Rusting from the inside will eventually leave you with not much to bond to. The mesh, paint, and clear will essential be all thats holding it on after a few months/years. If you can get to the back side of it from under the fender well you might want to keep an eye on it. Once most of the rust has fallen out, get yourself some of this \n\nhttp://www.boatersland.com/fib100868.html?gclid=CKHnpNWf9rECFeZgTAodNiUA8Q\n\nand make a nice even coat across the back side. Its like having fiberglass, resin, and cloth all premixed. Its much more resistant to water than bondo and will keep the splash up from driving from causing more rust over time.\nKittyJ: That's a great tip, thanks! I should be able to remember the name \"Kitty Hair\", but I don't think I'll often tell people what it's called. I'd get some funny looks. ;)\n\nI did use a rust treatment after scraping and sanding. But with that dense foam there, I can't really get to the rear side.

{"full_text": "theorymeltfool: [META] Can we ban (or tag) OPs who abandon threads?\nI like this sub a lot, and think it's great so far, but I've come to loathe people who I think should reward someone a delta, but have abandoned the thread without going back for the discussion or to admit that there views have been changed.\n\nAs subs grow (beyond 10,000+), there's a tendency for quality to slide as too many people find out about the sub through /r/random or from a sidebar somewhere (like /r/politics). Thus, you'll get people coming here that want to make a controversial post, but don't want to engage in a discussion.\n\nI think deleting the thread is a bad idea, since good discussion can still arise. Yet, i think banning OPs who abandon threads will help to encourage posters to stick around for the discussion, even if the OPs view remains unchanged.\n\nI think the options could be:\n\n* Giving the OP 24 hours to return to a thread. If they don't return in 24 hours:\n\n* Ban them, or:\n\n* Give them a tag that says something like \"thread abandoner,\" which will go away if they return to the original thread to either engage in discussion or reward deltas.\n\nI see this as a good way to differentiate this sub from /r/politicaldiscussion, as many controversial threads are made over there, yet OPs never get reprimanded for abandoning threads.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: Here are the most discussed options to consider:\n\n* Send warnings to OPs first, followed by a weeklong ban, and potentially a full ban if they make posts that aren't returned to in 24 hours\n\n* Flair at the top that states: How many Delta's were given, and if the OP returned to the sub to discuss at any time\n\n* Add a sidebar rule stating \"OPs are encouraged to engage in discussion; don't just make a post and not say anything again\"\n\nThanks everyone for the input and ideas!\nanumati: Some people have lives outside the internet. \n\nEdit: Also, the responses in here are not solely for the benefit of OP. Other people come along and read them. So even if OP does abandon thread the responses are still of some use.\ntheorymeltfool: Some people like stupid subs like /r/explainlikeimfive, /r/askreddit, or /r/askhistorians. I'm trying to hold this sub to a higher standard. So piss off if you don't like it\n\n\nI agree with your edit, but I don't see how adding flair, tags, etc., takes away from that. I never said that abandoned posts should be deleted.\nanumati: How exactly does me pointing out that maybe some people don't come back to their threads because they have lives outside the internet equate to ELIF?  \n\nI find your attitude overly hostile and knee jerk-y.  Almost as if you don't want to respectfully discuss something in a supreddit dedicated to respectful discussion and willingness to change opinions.\ntheorymeltfool: Because I took it the wrong way and thought you were making a jab at me for caring about this issue. I apologize. \n\nAnd I picked /r/explainlikeimfive because I think this sub is for people who have researched an issue but are looking for clarification or to step outside of confirmation bias, not like elif which is for people who are too lazy/dumb to research things on their own.\n\nAnd if people have 'lives' outside the Internet, then they shouldn't post here to begin with.\nanumati: I accept your apology.\n\nHowever, I think that you are placing unreasonable expectations on other people with regards to their commitment to discussion. \n\nFor one, by posting here, they are not agreeing to a specified quantity of debate. The goal is to have a conversation, but what if their experience is a round of first level replies to their post which all contain arguments with which they are familiar? They may know perfectly well all the counter-arguments and counter-counter-arguments. Do you think they should be obliged to \"go through the motions\" of replying in cases like that?\n\nFurther to that, for abstract discussions with virtual strangers, you can't reasonably expect anyone to be beholden to talk to someone else, especially if they have lost interest in the conversation. It would be ideal if people only posted when their interest was going to be maintained, however it is quite tricky to identify at what point something will become boring. \n\nSecondly, they are not obliged to post that their view has not changed, nor are they obliged to try to change the opinions of the responding posters. It would be polite to reply but if a response is utterly unconvincing, but I suspect such a post would be met with either disgruntlement or with continued attempts to discuss along a chain of logic that OP has no desire to follow.\n\nThirdly, people may not return because they have outside commitments or because things happen in their life. Or they may not return in a timely way, for any number of reasons. Some people have limited amounts of time to spend in leisure activities. I myself used to work 2 jobs, one full time one part time. There were days where I would leave for work at 7am and return home at 12am. If I had posted something the previous evening, it would be at least 48 hours before I would be able to see the result. \n\n&gt; And if people have 'lives' outside the Internet, then they shouldn't post here to begin with.\n\nAre you seriously stating that you believe this subreddit should only be accessed/used by people who have no job, no SO, no schooling to attend, no household chores, no interests in anything not internet based, and no friends with whom they spend time? See previous mention of unreasonable expectations.\n\nI think the real problem is that some people try trolling this sub with controversial posts and lost interest when the responses are reasonable and calm, and also that other people are using this sub as an ammo mine for discussions they are having elsewhere. \n\nIt's very tricky to regulate things like that effectively. You have no way of knowing if someone is posting about how they think babies should be served as dinner because they want to be sure their opinion is logically sound, or if they're posting that because they like babies and are distressed that their logic has led them to babies as a food source. \n\nAny attempts at regulation of that type run the risk of penalizing people for having a life, or for getting bored and not wanting to continue the discussion, or for not finding the responses up to their expectations.\n\nLastly, we already have a perfectly cromulent regulation system. It's called downvoting. If someone never returns to their thread, downvote it. It is completely legitimate to downvote a thread if the thread content does not live up to your standards for a decent thread.\ntheorymeltfool: &gt; However, I think that you are placing unreasonable expectations on other people with regards to their commitment to discussion. \n\nI know, but I'm trying to hold this sub to a higher standard. Otherwise, what will differentiate it from other subs, like /r/politicaldiscussion?\n\n&gt; Do you think they should be obliged to \"go through the motions\" of replying in cases like that?\n\nNope. But if they've heard all the counter arguments, they should state them in the text box. (most people will add statements like this, i.e. \"I've already heard X, Y, Z, etc., Is there anything *else* i'm missing?\")\n\n&gt; It would be ideal if people only posted when their interest was going to be maintained, however it is quite tricky to identify at what point something will become boring. \n\nThen they shouldn't come here. Again, higher standard.\n\n&gt; Thirdly, people may not return because they have outside commitments or because things happen in their life.\n\nThen they should wait til they have time, or say something like \"Falling asleep now, I'll be back in two days.\"\n\n&gt; Are you seriously stating that you believe this subreddit should only be accessed/used by people who have no job, no SO, no schooling to attend, no household chores, no interests in anything not internet based, and no friends with whom they spend time?\n\nNope.\n\n&gt; I think the real problem is that some people try trolling this sub with controversial posts and lost interest when the responses are reasonable and calm, and also that other people are using this sub as an ammo mine for discussions they are having elsewhere. \n\nThat's a problem as well. What do you think could be done to solve it?\n\n&gt; Any attempts at regulation of that type run the risk of penalizing people for having a life, or for getting bored and not wanting to continue the discussion, or for not finding the responses up to their expectations.\n\nI'm only referring to people who make posts, then don't return for *any* discussion.\n\n&gt; It's called downvoting. If someone never returns to their thread, downvote it. It is completely legitimate to downvote a thread if the thread content does not live up to your standards for a decent thread.\n\nEh, delta's are more powerful, and often result in people trying harder (writing lengthier responses) in order to earn the delta's. That's why i think this sub gives people a *slightly* more compelling reason to respond with a lengthy response. It's like a game, but it's only fun/works if people abide by the rules.\nanumati: Things like counter arguments in the text box sound good in theory, but are the kind of thing which puts people off from posting. The more hoops to jump through the less people willing. This is the kind of thing that kills forums and subreddits - making it not worth the effort.\n\n&gt; Then they shouldn't come here. Again, higher standard.\n\nProblem: They don't know in advance they are going to lose interest. \n\n&gt; Then they should wait til they have time.\n\nRefer to my first point in this post about the kind of thing which puts people off from posting. \"You can't post here unless you have 5 or 6 or 8 hours free to sit waiting for replies to your post so that you can respond to them promptly. If you live in a time zone other than the one the majority of people live in, you shouldn't post here at all, because your posts will be made when the majority of potential respondents are asleep and you will not get any replies until after you have gone to sleep. If you have children who might become ill, friends or relatives who might suddenly require help, work which unpredictably takes more hours than initially scheduled for, may get stuck in traffic, or any other unexpected time consuming events might occur, you should not post here.\"\n\n&gt; That's a problem as well. What do you think could be done to solve it?\n\nIt's not really a solvable problem unless you know something about changing human nature that I don't. One suggestion would be to penalize when someone has an ongoing pattern (say 4 or more within 1 month?) of controversial subject posts which they then abandon.\n\n&gt; delta's are more powerful\n\nOnly to people who are invested in some way in this subreddit. To the rest of reddit, karma matters. The people who make a thread and then abandon it are far more likely to care that their thread got down voted because they never came back. Not to mention, I could have sworn deltas only end up attached to those who change an opinion, not to those who submit threads?\n\n", "prompt": "theorymeltfool: [META] Can we ban (or tag) OPs who abandon threads?\nI like this sub a lot, and think it's great so far, but I've come to loathe people who I think should reward someone a delta, but have abandoned the thread without going back for", "orig": "the discussion or to admit that there views have been changed.\n\nAs subs grow (beyond 10,000+), there's a tendency for quality to slide as too many people find out about the sub through /r/random or from a sidebar somewhere (like /r/politics).

{"full_text": "Anonions: My core values are causing me more suffering than good - how can I change them?\nOkay so... I'm going to start with a little background. I'm 35 years old, coming from mildly christian family and I was raised accordingly. However I never really felt religion was my thing as I quickly found out that the society and most people around me don't function the way I'm expected to in the family... and I started wanting to build my life on different foundation than christian values as soon as I moved out from home (around my 20s). My family wasn't really big on going to church or such, but things like \"unconditional love and empathy\" were very much enforced and they demonised me if I was even bit of selfish (even healthily so). I only learnt as an adult that being ego driven, being narcissist and being selfish are three different things! Although they all have that negative association, at least being ego driven and selfish can still contribute to better self esteem than boundless self sacrifice to help those less fortunate. You can't help others unless you help yourself first, no matter how good it feels that you made someone elses day better. \n\nI've tried taking conscious choices to be more healthy selfish and put my needs first before helping others, as well as asserting those needs if necessary. Regardless it's very easy to slip back to this \"universal empathy\" and expectation of \"it being returned to me someday\" when there's little quarantee it ever will be. You know, it becomes toxic expectation to oblige people to return the good I've given and that's not how I want to function anymore. The faith I've been raised into, and what I've tried to learn to grow out of, has become an excuse to act in very toxic ways because not all people are driven to be good people.\n\nI feel hurt when people take my thoughtfulness towards them for granted (or used), I often get disappointed with them and myself, yet some deeper part of my subconscious hasn't still learnt to stop slipping back to that selfless autopilot. And I feel difficult to interact with people when it's... well... meaningless small talk or social drinking, without things like doing something with them or getting to know them deeper... with expectation that they will (again) be reliable like me when they aren't in most cases. \n\nNowadays it feels like being reliable, good moral person who is selfless and prefers long-term benefit over short term, it's like a \"social sin\" and easily taken advantage of, even if I draw and communicate boundaries! However when I try changing myself and act against these values of mine (reliability, honesty, loyalty, selflessness and equality between self and others) I start feeling deep inner pain.. So the pain comes either from how others treat me or how I act against my current values. It doesn't help that the society rewards people who get results whether their actions are moral or not, but moral and law-abiding citizens are less rewarded. It just makes me more resentful and even deeply misanthropic (and somehow my psyche justifies this as it's other people who show flaws). Also, lowering expectations doesn't help, that also results in me lowering boundaries and getting used and humiliated for \"being naive\" or too simple. \n\nI feel I'm starting to ramble and hope I still communicated the necessary. Considering I can't change others and knowing I won't be able to better my own life being like this, it's me who needs to change. But how can I do it?\nspectral_cat: I know what you are talking about, and I am right there as well, struggling with the same thing. I have very similar values to yours, and go through the painful feeling of being used over and over again.\n\nI am not sure how to solve this, but I started to realise that it's never about getting back something. There are no guarantees. For me what helped was the mindset of only giving what I would be willing to give even if that was our last  interaction. Only give as much as you are okay with, even if you don't get anything back. I refuse to be more egoistic, despite that I could achive more that way. Simply because that wouldn't be me, and no matter what I get back in return, nothing is as valuable to worth loosing myself for it.\n\nIt takes strength to keep doing what you do, but you have to know that even if you aren't necessarily making the world a better place for yourself, your kindness does make it a better place all together.\n\nIn short I would say, that you should keep on being kind, because the world needs us, but don't give anything more than what you are willing to loose. This is what helps me keep going forward, even when it's hard.\nAnonions: To me, at first, it wasn't either. It's just like making the world a better place for others but over time, it disappoints me that very little give similar consideration of me when in need. And I'd rather not rely on others for favors or good deeds, but no human is an island. If I were skilled at all things and wouldn't need help of anyone in anything, I'd certainly take that option instead of helping others and sometimes expecting that people would return that goodwill if needed. I mean, I still don't want to force or oblige people into it - I'm just disappointed it isn't something hardwired to people. This way, I feel christian teachings are deeply misguiding about human nature and no reliance to God in physical plane will even make me happy - it'll just be impractical and undermine my time here. In afterlife I have every moment for God if needed, just not on Earth.  Thus I want to have those same opportunities that other people around me are getting so easily.. but how, if not through empathic goodwill or the other way, being very ego driven and therefore ignoring needs of others?\n\nI've tried refusing to be ego driven but all this frustration is slowly putting me into denial. Mostly people associate \"in denial\" with deeper relationship problems but for me it's even with casual interaction. Social interaction is energy exchange whether we want it or not. Sometimes I'd want gold for gold, iron for iron and garbage for garbage... not iron that only looks like gold for gold or garbage for gold, if you get what I mean. Because I'd find hard to receive gold if I were consciously giving garbage or iron too.\nspectral_cat: Not so long ago, my girlfriend cheated on me.\n\nThe relationship was awesome, we had a lot of fun together, and she told me that I helped her a lot by sticking by her side even when it was difficult for her, even when she wasn't her best self. I showed her that she is acceptable even when she isn't perfect.\n\nBut she went to another country for a semester. In a few weeks after she left, I visited her, we had an awesome time together, and when we parted our ways I was never so sure that we are both deeply in love.\n\nAfter I left in just a few days she met someone, and she slept with him, waited a week until that thing stabilized, and then told me that she is now with someone who can give her what she needs.\n\nIt was pretty bad. I know how many problems she had and seeing that she is getting better by my side day by day, it felt like its own reward. I don't think that I have to explain any further how it felt when she did what she did.\n\nSince then, each day is a fight. I decided to forgive her, and not to let anger and hatred grow inside me. Instead, cherish that I made someone else's life better, because by that I made the world a better place. You know, in the bible it is said that if they throw rocks at you, throw bread at them. I never really understood that. I always asked \"why would I let them hurt me?\". Now I start to understand, that it isn't about letting them hurt you. It is about learning how to not let them hurt you.\n\nWe build our relationships too strongly on what we give each other. But why is that we don't hate the hurricane even if it takes away our house? - I believe that it's because we can handle it as something that is independent from us. We can protect ourselves from it, but we can't really expect it to consider how it feels for us what it does. We can't judge it on our own morals.\n\nYou probably remember from the bible, that in the beginning, in the eden people were happy. They were happy until they ate the forbidden fruit. And that fruit was of the knowledge of good and bad. Before that, only God knew good from bad, and when God created the world, God saw that everything that he has created was good.\n\nIn my belief it is not our job to decide wether someone else is good or not. It is difficult enough already to just decide wether the things we do ourselves are good or bad. We have to judge our own actions in order to be able to make decisions that we can stand behind, but judging others has no use since we can't choose what they do.\n\nAnd so, I try to learn to take everything around me without judgement. Things are as they are. It isn't bad or good, it's just the way it is. You see, this way while things can be bad for me, I won't become hateful myself and I won't let it affect my life in negative ways. So I won't really be hurt. Being hurt means we have a wound and a wound stops us from doing what we could do without it. If however we don't have the wound, that means that we can do everything we could before, or even more. Possibly even more, because as they say \"No pain no gain\". We can use our bad experiences to better understand the world around us.\n\nThis whole thing of looking at our surroundings as something that is as it is, is very alienating. But it doesn't have to be. Because as soon as we understand how to live our life free from judgement, we also become suited for feeling true empathy. Understanding, that deep down we are all one, we are all human beings. And as this happens, you can start to see yourself in the hurricane, in your surroundings, in the people around you. And at that moment you really understand that you too are the surrounding of others. Now this understanding is not so ego driven as when we did things because we expected something in return. Now we can do things out of pure empathy, because now we understand that the one who we help could be us, and in a way IS us.\n\nI have understood that even though my girlfriend did hurt me, she was hurt by others before, and those others were hurt by even more people. No-one even knows where all this pain comes from, but I want to stop it. I don't want to continue this chain, and I don't want to give it back either. I had to take it, but now that it is here, I can put it down, I can translate it to something nice, I can use this experience to help others. It's difficult. But maybe, just maybe if I succeed in it, and I can use this to help someone else, then with this help that person might help someone else, so we can start a new chain that goes from one person to another, but one that is good.\n\nI don't know if this made any sense, but I hope that you could take something useful from it. I still fight really hard to be able to live this way, because it isn't easy. Even though I know it better, a small voice in my head still keeps telling me over and over again that I am weak, and that I just let other people use me. And not giving in to that voice takes all of my strength. But I believe that what I do is the right thing to do, so I fight and maybe there will be a day when I will find myself not just thinking that this is what I want to live by, but indeed living by it.\nAnonions: I'm sorry to hear that. I can imagine how it stung and how her choice to ditch you for someone else came totally from bushes. I just can't get why people act the way she did. And I'm sorry but I also would judge such people as she could've just acted better. I have never been allowed or have had opportunities to \"use\" anyone like that and usually I wouldn't but I'm starting to fall into the mindset that just some excuse of a person who acts according to what I like is better than nothing. The ideal would be none would be forced in it nor cheated on... but it's an ideal world, impractical as christian \"true empathy\".\n\nThink of my perspective this way, if someone throws rocks at me and won't stop, they just see it's okay to throw rocks at me because they can get away with it. I want them to stop. Throwing bread at them will only nourish them to throw more rocks at me and repeat that to someone else until someone ruthless and immoral enough will -return- that behavior back to them and overwhelm them with rain of rocks. Perhaps then they would rethink if it's wise to throw rocks at people or would they choose that bread instead. This \"true empathy\" encourages too much submission and hope that they will stop, but no action for your own good or self defense. That is bad. And even if you'd throw bread at someone and just receive more rocks, someday you will run out of bread. \n\n\"No pain, no gain\" also very true. However our life in physical plane is fleeting. You can go through lots of pain and still be waiting for results of that sweat and pain... and just keep acting until it's too painful to go on. Where are the results? Sometimes one gotta be practical and have results to improve your life, but it's like trying to get out of quicksand instead of just walking on sandy area til you can rest somewhere. The feeling of rug constantly being pulled from under your feet.\n\nLook, I wouldn't be asking advice on changing my core values if I didn't see a problem. And this \"true empathy\" is being a problem because I can't do both act according to that and improve my life, _it doesn't practically work for me anymore_. I'm either hurt by others or myself and if it were up to me, if I could survive on my own, I would do that and cut out all contact to other people. Because I \"won't be getting anything in return\" anyway, then it's at least fair trade: Nobody gets anything.\n\nI don't want to be constantly benefitting physical existences of others if it's not them benefitting -with me- but -at my expense-.\n\nI'm sorry my anger and resentment are taking over and I'm not going to shame letting it show - they are part of wholeness. I just... don't feel it's rewarding to be moral and good anymore and I want to change. I want to experience other sides of life than being the one to help people and understand them all the time, the one to toss bread when I could some day achieve moral freedom to toss rocks instead and experience how that side of life feels. Perhaps I'll one day return to God wiser by a few experiences, less limited in my growth.\nspectral_cat: I understand where are you coming from because I often have the very same doubts myself.\n\nBut think about it this way: The wise gambler doesn't bet for the win, just pays for the game.\n\nBeing kind isn't the same as letting others use you. You can only be used if you let yourself get into situations that you are not willing to be in, yet you still are there and do things that you don't really want to do. I understood that I should never expect anything in return. If even so I am willing to do what I do, then it's great, but if not, then I simply shouldn't do it. This way I never have to regret the things I do. Expecting things back bounds us to the people and thus makes us vulnerable.\n\nYou want something from someone? Just ask for it! Either they give it or not, but don't ever do things for them just because you want something in return. Unconsciously, but I did this a lot and only now I see how manipulative this attitude is. I am still guilty of it sometimes, but slowly I am learning to leave this attitude behind.\n\nThe bread is empathy, and if someone keeps throwing you with rocks even when you are understanding, then it's best to not put any effort into that relationship. No positive but no negative either. Because there are people who value your efforts more so it's just better for everyone if you help them.\n\nDoes it hurt what she did? - Sure it does. Am I sorry for the things I gave her? - Hell no! It was absolutely awesome while it lasted! So why would I be sour, why would I want to hurt her back? - Either she already hurt herself enough by doing what she did, or if not then I am just wasting my time by trying to make someone feel sorry who doesn't even care.\n\nWe had a nice time together, and now we don't have that anymore. Should I be angry about it? Why? I didn't lose anything I had before her. She didn't disable me in any way. Sure I could cling on how humiliating the things she did to me were (because she didn't stop with cheating me, she did some other things as well..), but honestly if I hurt myself by overthinking things, then that's completely on me. We had a fun time together, she feels now generally better because of our time together, and well, that's good for her. There is nothing I regret.\n\nPeople can do bad things to us, but thinking that we can do anything against it is a lie. Because there will always be a way, no need to be an underdog and no need to become vicious, just expect the unexpected. Life is not a trade, pay for playing the game you love to play, and do not bet for the win because it's never sure wether you win or loose. But does winning even matter if you enjoyed the game?\n\n The only decision I have to make here is how much energy I want to invest into her, and that only depends on how much I enjoy her company, not on what I expect from her.\nBut investing negative energy into anything is just plain waste. Hate doesn't make anything better, but it is exhausting. If I have so much energy then why shouldn't I be constructive instead? Building is always better than destroying, and if someone isn't worth to put any effort into, then why would I waste my time with hurting them? I can simply chose to find a better place for my energy where I can do something that's actually good.\n\nLosing my help, my company should be enough of a lesson in itself for anyone, throwing rocks back will just make things worse for everyone.\n", "prompt": "Anonions: My core values are causing me more suffering than good - how can I change them?\nOkay so...

Here are some examples of things you can start apologizing for:\n\n* That text you phrased oddly the other day\n* Not being available all the time\n* Being bad at an activity you're new to\n* Being different from the person you're talking to\n* Being so awkward (obviously!)\n\n**2: Make them press for details**\n\nConversation is a two way street, but for you, it only goes one way: To a dead end. That's why when you're having a conversation, you should never take cues from the other person to give details when it's your turn to talk. I repeat, DO NOT VOLUNTEER MORE INFORMATION THAN NECESSARY! Please observe the following conversation as an example of how to follow this tip properly:\n\n\"How are you doing?\"\n\n\"A little anxious.\"\n\n\"Because of all the people around?\"\n\n\"No, because I drove the truck here.\"\n\n\"Is it a manual transmission?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Is that why you're anxious?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"You can't drive stick too well?\"\n\n\"No, I can.\"\n\n\"How old is it?\"\n\n\"It's from the 70's.\"\n\n\"That is old.\"\n\n\"yeaH.\"\n\n**3: Monopolize the conversation**\n\nIf you aren't saying at least 95% of the words in a conversation, there's a much higher chance that the person you are talking to is having a good time. To be sure that your partner's enjoyment levels are dropping, you shouldn't let your partner get more than one sentence in every 5 minutes or so. A great way to do this is to talk about a topic that your partner doesn't know much about, and tell them a lengthy story about it, no shorter than 15 minutes but preferably 30-45 minutes. If you can include pictures, make sure that it takes you no shorter than 1.5 minutes to look through your phone to pull them up. Don't forget to leave out all the details, and apologize for taking so long! When you see your partner begin to fidget, lose the smile on their face, and check their watch or phone for the time, you have successfully STARTED this task!\n\n**4: Slander people around you behind their back**\n\nSo you're following all of these tips and people STILL want to talk to you? Just try saying something highly unflattering about someone who hasn't shown up yet, or who just went to the bathroom! Oh, and don't forget that you're being \"honest\". The intended effect is to make other people not want to be around you so that they assume you're not saying nasty things about them behind their back. See the following example:\n\n\"Who else is on their way?\"\n\n\"Garrett, Michelle, and Devin.\"\n\n\"Devin, the short, fat one who talks with a hick accent?\"\n\n\"I...guess, if we're putting it that way.\"\n\n\"What? I'm just being honest!\"\n\nNow, this last tip is for only those who are SERIOUS about ruining conversations. Only the most serious need apply.\n\n**5: Comment on how awkward this conversation is becoming**\n\nWhat a mood killer, right? Well, how are you supposed to incorporate this doozy? Optimally, you should use this after following at least one of the tips from before. The intended effect of this tip is to imply that it is the fault of your conversational partner for the awkwardness, and for making YOU uncomfortable. Here are some example sentences you can pop anytime there are more than 3 seconds of silence:\n\n* \"Well, this conversation has taken a turn for the awkward, hasn't it?\"\n* \"I feel so awkward haha\"\n* \"Awkward!\"\n* \"Sorry I'm so awkward!\"\n\nAnd that's a wrap for 5 easy ways to make a conversation more awkward! What tips would you add to this list?\nObi_Schrimm: This is probably the most useful and at the same time least useful things I\u2019ve read in my entire life.

{"full_text": "KokishinNeko: How to Seal Foods Air-Free Without a Vacuum Sealer\n\ntheartfulcodger: There's a big difference between displacing the *visible* air pockets that are normally trapped in the bag, and drawing a commercial grade vacuum that eliminates virtually *all* the air. \n\nAfter all, a thick freezer bag is going to be imperfect at contouring itself around the food, because with the bag that close to the surface, you're trying to displace the air using water pressure of just a few ounces per square inch. To get the same pressure from water as a typical countertop sealer does from atmospheric pressure, you'd have to submerge your bag to about 20 feet, or more than twice the depth of a typical in-ground backyard pool. (32.8 feet would be needed to achieve a full atmosphere difference - but then again, a countertop vacuum sealer would have to draw a perfect vacuum in order to get a 1 atmo gradient).\n\nSo because of the minuscule amount of pressure supplied, the water method will still leave plenty of air in the bag - it'll just be trapped as smaller bubbles around and within the food. Over time, first the oxygen in those bubbles will oxidize the food (giving it that \"freezer\" taste), then the bubbles themselves will eventually percolate out to form an air pocket large enough that the food will throw off ice crystals and dessicate, ie \"freezer burn\". Or, in the case of *sous vide* cooking, the well-distributed bubbles of air will allow runaway aerobic bacterial spoilage as the article cooks.\n\nOn the other hand, because we're standing at the very bottom of a metaphorical ocean of air, even a light-duty countertop vacuum can create a difference in atmospheric pressure of about 10 PSI to squeeze out the majority of the smaller air bubbles - both those trapped between the bag and the food, and those stuck between cellular membranes (which is why using a vacuum container substantially reduces marinating/brining time). As a result, when food is subject to a proper commercial vacuum, much less oxidation and dehydration occurs while frozen - and far less opportunity for bacteria to reproduce during *sous vide* cooking.\n\nThat being said, this is a reasonably good way to reduce freezer burn in stuff you're only planning to freeze for a month or two, without a big cash outlay for an actual vacuum unit.\nIsntThatSpecia1: That and a home-grade vacuum sealer is like $50. It's a lot less hassle than having a big tub of water in you kitchen all the time.\n\nPlus, I use just the sealer function for all sorts of things I want to keep in a water-tight container. And are you going camping and need your close ultra-tightly packed? Vacuum sealer works great.\nbrannana: &gt; It's a lot less hassle than having a big tub of water in you kitchen all the time.\n\nYeah, having a sink in your kitchen is a pain in the ass.  /s\n\nIan_Itor: Continuously wasting 5-10 litres of water everytime you want to semi-vacuum seal something is a pain. Maybe not in your ass, but for the environment. \naRVAthrowaway: Why? That's literally like maybe 30 (US) cents of water? Also (unless you live in the middle of a desert), how is \"wasting\" water bad for the environment? It goes right back to the environment.\nGorillaNosh: IMO it's not the specific 5-10 litres lost Everytime you vaccuming seal... It's the habit of thinking about water as a disposable, non-scarce resource.  Visited a friend in California last year... They were flushing toilets with grey water and having a lot of plants dry up.  Things change quickly.  We forget how important water is because it flows freely from the tap. If I poured 5-10 litres down the drain in Cali last year my buds family would have been shocked. If I did it occasionally they would have been pissed.\n\nWasting water puts more stress on the aquifer and reservoir. We have made a habit (in USA at least) of not putting much value on water.\n\nBig corporations are buying up any freshwater rights they can get their hands on.  In ~25 years water won't be such an easy thing to pour down the drain.  It seems weird to think about harvesting shower, sink and laundry water for a second purpose on your property... It's going to become commonplace soon.  Not tomorrow, but within your lifetime.\naRVAthrowaway: TIL Earth doesn't have a natural water cycle.\n\n&gt; It's the habit of thinking about water as a disposable, non-scarce resource.\n\nBecause....it is. \n\n&gt; They were flushing toilets with grey water and having a lot of plants dry up. Things change quickly. We forget how important water is because it flows freely from the tap. If I poured 5-10 litres down the drain in Cali last year my buds family would have been shocked. If I did it occasionally they would have been pissed.\n\nHence the reason I prefaced my comment with \"unless you live in the middle of a desert\"...which is essentially all California is (or at least what their main water supplies flow through). If you live in a dry, arid climate in which evaporation takes place at a much higher rate and your water table is virtually nonexistent, then be prepared to conserve water. Otherwise, it really doesn't matter because that's what the water cycle does: I pour water down my drain, it goes to the waste treatment plant, waste treatment plant sends it to the river, it evaporates from the river or seeps into the water table, people use the water, it evaporates, it rains, etc. etc. You're pretty much never \"wasting\" water on Earth as far as I'm concerned.\n\n&gt; Big corporations are buying up any freshwater rights they can get their hands on. In ~25 years water won't be such an easy thing to pour down the drain. It seems weird to think about harvesting shower, sink and laundry water for a second purpose on your property... It's going to become commonplace soon. Not tomorrow, but within your lifetime.\n\nAnd you'd have the world think this is at an *alarming* rate, which is BS. It's been commonplace for decades now, and all its ever been used for is bottling drinking water. /r/conspiracy is that way ----&gt;\n\nAnyway, you still don't explain whatsoever about how wasting water is bad for the environment, which was the original question. So, how?\nGorillaNosh: \"Commonplace for decades\" isn't a long time.\n\ni will refrain from talking about increasing water shortages all over the place, not just desserts.  I will refrain from balking at your assertion that companies buying fresh water rights and then selling that resource (in whatever form bottles, irrigation, industrial purposes) only seems to become troubling once there is less and less available in the ground.  right now, it still flows cheaply from the tap... so cheaply, it almost feels free.  i will refrain from cataloging the socioeconomic realities of water scarcity. i will also attempt to leave climate change and desertification of certain areas out of the discussion.\n\nPotable water is not pumped to your house for free... the energy used to treat and filter water going to and from your house is not free... More CO2 is likely released to achieve this, especially at sewage treatment plants.  this is compounded many times if a person is on municipal water... and as populations grow, and water stress increases, more and more people will be on municiple water.\n\nBut you are correct... i failed to directly address your very specific concern.  and the answer is as Humans use and waste water, the return of the water is majorly sent directly to piped and channeled systems that hurry the water through the cycle.  it spends less time on land and less time moving through the ground, through vernal pools, and through wetlands.  concerning vernal pools and wetlands especially... that affects the ecosystem.\n\na septic system bypasses this somewhat but urbanization cannot (or will not) be able to rely on such systems.  \n\nwaste water, even if its clean, is diverted to some kind of water way (often man made and devoid of vegetation in big cities) which speeds it along to the ocean.  ultimately less fresh water on and in the ground.  5-10 litres doesnt seem like a lot when its one house.  but the mentality that wasting water isnt a realistic concern leads to less fresh water and a hastened commercialization of the resource as it grows scarcer...  it is already illegal in some places in the US to capture rainwater in rain barrels...   californians are struggling against having their own wells metered.  however, as populations increase, its not just deserts that run low on water.\n\nas less fresh water is available on land (a situation further stressed by folks wasting it)  water rights and how they confer will change.  when they change, the folks who have all the rights because they bought them for the innocent practice of bottling the water... are now in control of something much more valuable than convenient hydration.  they control whether land is habitable, and who gets to live on it.  this is the case in water stressed areas right now.  if the world continues to heat up, this will be the case in more areas than it is today.  Forget whether its man made or not, the earth is warming.  the more water removed from the system and hastened along the system, affects the surrounding areas that used to rely on it.\n\nas global population increases, cities expand... being smart about water will become more and more obvious as water tables drop... and they will drop everywhere, not just deserts.  two mouths drink more water than one.\n\nTL:DR when we waste it, its spending less time on/in land because of channeled techniques to remove the wastewater.  this affects ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n \naRVAthrowaway: ...annnnnd then it goes into the ocean/lakes/rivers, evaporates, turning into clouds, and raining on land. Yours is still a pretty inaccurate answer. It's not wasting. Water doesn't escape our global ecosystem, so it's never actually wasted.\nGorillaNosh: Yes, I understood your point. I'm aware that fresh water is here to stay. Rain isn't going anywhere. we agree on that.  How much of it which is available to the land and how long it is allowed to remain to on/in the land is what I'm referencing.  there is an ecological cost to the use and disposal of potable water as humans do it. Wasting (as opposed to conserving) exacerbates that problem. You said there is no environmental cost. There is. \n\n\naRVAthrowaway: But, again, there isn't. There's a anthropic cost, not an *environmental* one. Humans can't survive without access to water, though the Earth can. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter how much water \"is available to the land\" (though it's pretty constant via the water cycle; see all of my above comments and simple and easy to understand chart of the water cycle) except to humans that want to or already do inhabit that land.\nGorillaNosh: If you snuffed out the Sun and jettisoned all the water into space the Earth would also still survive. If that's what you want to reduce this discussion to then I will concede to your point but no one was ever arguing with you about that.\n\nThe water cycle is obvious. What you are willfully ignoring is the rate at which the potable water is extracted. This is hastened as we waste rather then conserve.  The water cycle is not going to ramp up production as more people extract from fresh water aquifers. Extraction has only ever increased... Largely a function of population.\n\nWater tables across the globe are dropping. I think what's going on here is that we have different definitions as to what environmental cost is. And in that regard I will concedethe point that of course the Earth Will Survive even if all the water on the planet was to hypothetically disapear. I suppose we just differ on the outcome of that. I would call that a very large environmental cost. Namely all living life. It would seem that you are describing the environment as just a general term for the way certain thing is... a dead stone planet orbiting the Sun has an environment I suppose but that's not what I'm referring to. I am referring to it as an ecosystem harboring measurable amounts of biomass. When I say there will be a cost what I mean is that things will be affected. When people waste water they add to that cost. They may not add to it at a massive scale but they add to it.\n\n\n\n\naRVAthrowaway: &gt; The water cycle is not going to ramp up production as more people extract from fresh water aquifers. Extraction has only ever increased... Largely a function of population.\n\nBut...it does. The more water that makes it to the surface for evaporation, the more that gets into the air and the more that rains down back on land and goes back into the water table. It's pretty simple.\nGorillaNosh: Or... It doesn't, or at least not in ratio to population, otherwise groundwater tables would not be shrinking. I wish it were as simple as your claiming. \n", "prompt": "KokishinNeko: How to Seal Foods Air-Free Without a Vacuum Sealer\n\ntheartfulcodger: There's a big difference between displacing the *visible* air pockets that are normally trapped in the bag, and drawing a commercial grade vacuum that eliminates virtually *all* the air.", "orig": "After all, a thick freezer bag is going to be imperfect at contouring itself around the food, because with the bag that close to the surface, you're trying to displace the air using water pressure of just a few ounces per square inch.

At that point, I'm not the person who cares about an insurance claim paying out.  If something goes wrong, it's their fault.\nBlazerMorte: That doesn't make it the right way to ship it, dude. There's refusing to admit you're wrong and then there's using a backhoe to dig yourself a hole. You were wrong about something you don't do professionally and tried to deflect that by attacking the person who called you out. That's an option, but you're still wrong and I'm still right. Wouldn't it just be easier to let it go?\nJerl: The right way to ship it is the way that gets me my money back, and shipping it back in the bag it came in gets me my money back.\n\nI haven't attacked anyone.  Are you confusing me with someone else?\nBlazerMorte: So you can't read the link? Or you just can't admit you're wrong?\nJerl: Shipping it back in the bag it came in will get me my money back.  It doesn't matter to me if UPS likes the way it was shipped - I didn't pay for shipping in either direction, that was paid by the vendor I'm returning the item to.  If the package gets damaged on the way back and the vendor is unable to get their money back from an insurance claim, they're the one who selected the bag, not me.\nBlazerMorte: So your argument, for next time, isn't \"I'm correct in saying poly bags are an approved shipping method,\" but rather \"I'm ill-informed and don't care what the proper procedure is so long as it's someone else who gets fucked by my choices.\" \n\nThat'll prevent arguments in the future. I really don't care if you choose to be wrong, but let's not pretend like that somehow makes you right. \nJerl: You're the only one here who ever seemed to care about it being *approved*. I'm not paying for a corregated box to ship something back if it came in a bag.  The seller isn't getting fucked by my choices, they're getting fucked by their own.\nBlazerMorte: Yes, it's literally part of my job to know and communicate the difference. You're the only one here who can't admit that he's wrong and keeps moving the goalposts to try to fix that problem.\n\nOnce again, you are misinformed and wrong. That's okay, it's not a knock on your character, it's just the relevant facts of the matter.\nJerl: The goalpost was *never at* it being approved, though.  You're the one who moved it there at the start of this comment thread.\nBlazerMorte: Because the pro tip, in this case, is potentially harmful and I am literally a professional in this field. If I can't respond to a bad piece of advice, about why that advice is bad, about the field I work in, then when might I have your permission to post?\nJerl: Potentially harmful to the seller who sent it in the bag in the first place who, for sending it in a bag instead of an approved, should be prepared to deal with the consequences from that point.  They opened themselves up to those consequences the moment they selected a bag.  The buyer returning the product in the packaging it came in can't be blamed for the poor packaging - if the seller felt it was good enough to ship it to the buyer despite not being covered by UPS, clearly it's good enough for the buyer to ship it back to the seller despite not being covered by UPS.\nBlazerMorte: Dude, you're arguing with a professional about their profession. How much of a snowflake are you gonna be?\nJerl: It's okay if your professional opinion about what constitutes \"correct\" (UPS approved) differs from the layperson's opinion about what's correct (we get our money back from our return).

Basically you're desensitizing your immune system using micro doses of the allergen. There are two types of immunotherapy. One is an injection that you do three times a week, and the other is drops you put under the tongue.\n\nWhy YSK: If your allergies really bother you, you could get them cured potentially.\n\nPersonal story: It is worth pointing out that the FDA has not approved all types of the drops being used for allergies yet, despite Europe and the UK having used them for a decade. What this means is that if you are in the US, your insurance will not necessarily pay for the drops depending on your allergies. I mistakenly thought that this meant the shots would be easier. However you have to go in and pay the doctor to give you the shots, in person, since with them there is a risk of anaphylaxis. This in the long term made it more expensive than paying $100 for a 3-month supply of drops.\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/allergy-shots/about/pac-20392876\n\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/otolaryngology/specialty_areas/sinus_center/sublingual_immunotherapy.html\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/allergy-drops\nBfreak: Quick note: be realistic about expectations. I'm 4 years into immunotherapy treatment for very serious hay-fever (frequently unable to drive/work/sleep during the season) with no change to my reactions. Immunotherapy is far from guaranteed to work, and in most cases may only alleviate symptoms, and make no change at all to the worst cases.\nAnimedjinn: Hay fever is often caused by multiple allergens. So it is also possible you are only treating the major ones but have minor allergens still affecting you\nBfreak: In order to receive immunotherapy you are tested for all possible allergens.\nAnimedjinn: That's untrue. They test you for the most likely allergies. They often don't test for all of them. What's more there are millions of plants and other potential allergies and they only do immunotherapy for the ones that are allergenic for the most people.\nBfreak: *sigh* thank you for informing me about an illness I have spent my entire life dealing with, including dozens of blood tests, consultations with at leat 10 doctors, and have tried every clinical approach under the sun to remedy.\n\nTo expand on your largely irrelevant reply, grass allergy paneling confirms the strains of grass that you are allergic too, and your treatment is custom made dose of the exact allergens that you *definitely* tested positive to. My symptoms appear only during grass pollen season, and can be alleviated by being somewhere where grass pollen is absent.\nAnimedjinn: I am not saying what you are saying isn't true.

{"full_text": "WaterDemonPhoenix: CMV: I don't see consensual promiscuous people as immoral or even something as society gone bad\nI fail to see why the number of people having sex should matter to me. If you claim it increases the risk of getting a disease, it's for them, and that's a choice they make for their own body. I don't see them as bad people. It's the same thing with people choosing to drink coffee, eat a burger etc. All are unhealthy, all are not my business.\n\nIf you don't want to sleep with a high risk person, ask for a test. If they refuse, no need to get mad. Politely walk away. It's not a big deal. Bodies aren't something for you. It's for people who have the body to agree to allow 'usage'.\n\nI don't know, I think my view is kind of simple and I probably do need to think about it, but overall when I hear people talk about how much sex they have, I don't go, 'this is wrong, something needs to change' Now it could be my community, but i hear a lot of people go like 'ugh, society is gone to shit, we need to fix it'. No one offers solutions, but I guess thats not really part of my CMV.\n\nLike I guess if I had to pick, lets say a friend with 5 sexual partners and the same movie taste as me, and another with 1 partner and no shared movie taste. Lets also assume they are the same gender as me, and all though I am gay, both are straight. I'd probably be friends with the one with 5 sexual partners. Why? Because the number of sexual partners, past or present, just doesn't matter to me, and I don't see why it does to others. (What mattered in this analogy is the movie)\n\nEdit: I guess the CMV isn't 'convince me why I shouldn't sleep around' but rather 'convince me why I should avoid being friends with people who sleep around' or 'convince people who sleep around that they are bad people'\nLordCosmagog: A friend with five sexual partners would be flaky as hell, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be comfortable ever drinking from the same bottle as them\n\nThe reason it\u2019s seen as immoral is the numerous risks it carries, as well as the fact that sex not for reproduction is a very self centred act (not judging, we all do it, but it\u2019s not like we fuck for charity). \n\nSo someone who has a very active sex life with multiple partners is almost bound to be shallow and self centred, whereas someone in a monogamous relationship has PROVEN loyalty and selflessness and commitment. They have self control. \n\nI\u2019d never quit being someone\u2019s friend because they had tons of sex partners, but I\u2019d also be prepared for the probability that it wouldn\u2019t be the most stable of friendships and that\u2019s probably not someone I could count on\njaredliveson: You do a lot of assuming. There's no reason to think that monogamous people are more selfless or have more self control. Assuming people that fuck alot does not mean they're shallow and self centered. You can boing for plenty of reasons and your own prejudice is the downfall of your response\nLordCosmagog: \u201cYou can boing for plenty of reasons\u201d. Uh, no, actually pretty much just two reasons - orgasms and kids. If you\u2019re not doing it for kids you\u2019re doing it for orgasms, which translates as personal pleasure. \n\nAnd yes, there are plenty of reasons to argue monogamous people have more self control than promiscuous people, namely the fact that they\u2019re in a committed relationship and not risking STDs for the sake of orgasms\njaredliveson: You can do it to spend time with someone, or to relieve tension after a fight, or to show that you're vulnerable with someone.\n\nSelf control isn't a factor. Monogamy isn't for everyone and STDs are easy to avoid.\nLordCosmagog: Yeah, no. If you wanna relieve stress, go for a run. If you wanna spend time, watch a movie and cuddle. Sex is for orgasms and babies. If it didn\u2019t feel good, we wouldn\u2019t do it nearly as often.\njaredliveson: That's not factual. That's just how you feel. And those are fine alternatives I guess\nLordCosmagog: That\u2019s not how I feel, that is a fact - people have sex for orgasms or for babies. If you subtracted orgasms, how many people do you think would have sex recreationally?\njaredliveson: Plenty. There are plenty of times I've had sex without cumming. noone you've ever had sex with has cum with you but I'm sure they had a great time regardless. Talk to a woman and ask them if an orgasm is the most important part of sex\nLordCosmagog: I\u2019m pretty sure with women there\u2019s at least hope for an orgasm\n\nBesides if you can\u2019t make them cum from sex there\u2019s always other stuff in the same context. But men cum pretty much every time. Hey some might say the sex stops when the man cums\nCaptainMisha12: 1) sex stops when the man cums? Since when?\n\n2) it's significantly easier to have sex all the time if you're in a monogamous relationship. It's not easy to get into a poly relationship and being single is hit-and-miss with hookups - but monogamous relationships can end up with you and your partner having sex twice a day every day if you want. There's no way that you can logically say the relationship that gets you lots of sex with easy access is proof of anything other than an understanding of delayed gratification.\n\n3) just because you have sex with one person doesn't mean that you're  necessarily committed to them - you're making the assumption that everyone in a monogamous relationship both wants more sex than what they are getting and has access to do so.\nLordCosmagog: 1. Stops is a vague term, what I meant was a single session generally finishes up once the guy cums and you have to wait for him to get hard again\n\n2. True, monogamous people have more sex, but they do so on a more consistent basis, because it\u2019s just two people\u2019s schedules. If you were poly, the sex would occur more inconsistently and on a more sporadic basis, which is why I say flakey \n\n3.

My mom lives on Dallas and she always books my flights when I come visit her cause it\u2019s $500+ where I am and $275 to about $400 max where she is. Both round trip.\n\nEDIT: \u201ctrue\u201d based on an experience I had.\nBarflyerdammit: I know you're getting downvoted, but they do write the software to allow for different pricing based on the country you're buying the ticket.  If you're in Mexico and Mom is in Dallas, you might be right.  If you're both in the US, you might be doing something wrong.  PM me if you need tips on figuring that out.\nrichardkim_nyc: When people think NYC, they always assume JFK or LGA. I live closer to ISP (MacArthur Airport) so I fly out of there. Flights from there to DFW are never direct. I have a short layover and the cost is $315 on the low end (if I book months in advance) or $500+ if I book within the month.\n\nNow follow me if you will cause this is where I get a bit crafty. \n\nNow I\u2019m crafty. I know ISP has plenty of flights going to Fort Lauderdale cause of all the retired folks flying back and forth for weekend getaways. Those flights are always $98 round trip with Frontier if the flight leaves on a non-holiday weekend.\n\nAnd I also know Spirit has a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Dallas on weekends for $98. And those flights arrive and leave about 30 minutes apart both ways. Which means I can actually hop on from on flight to another. I haven\u2019t missed this connection yet. \n\nIf my mom books an American Airlines flight from FLL to DFW, it\u2019s around $129 or $150. The benefit of AA is so I get to enjoy my flight cause Spirit is horrible. However, if I try to book a FLL to DFW flight from NYC, my cost will be around $339. Why? It\u2019s simple.\n\nAmerican Airlines has a flight from ISP to DFW something around $489 to as much as $850 with something absurdly stupid like 2 layovers turning a 3 hour flight to an 8 hour debacle. They do this to get people from where I live to avoid ISP and fly from JFK because ISP is not a major hub for American Airlines and costs more money (most flights from JFK to Dallas seem to be AA). And also to make up for the fact that FLL to DFW booked from NYC is around $339. My other guess is cause AA knows that it will cost me a lot of money to get from my home to JFK so they\u2019re trying to make an extra buck my charging me more for flying out of ISP. \n\nNow why would I not take a $200 flight from JFK to DFW and not do this?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the big picture. \n\nIf I took a taxi from my home to JFK, it would easily cost $200 via Uber one way. That means I spend $400 on just an Uber. Some my argue that I could take the train to JFK. I could. But why? That\u2019s a 2-3 hours added to my travel (while paying more) and I would still have to dish out $20-$30 one way for an Uber. That means $60 for Uber to the train.\n\nNow if I decide to DRIVE to JFK now I have to worry about 2 things - cost of parking and vandalism to my vehicle. Two weeks of leaving my car at JFK is a lot of money that I would rather not spend. Account for gas and it\u2019s more expensive than an Uber.\n\nWhy do all that when I can fly from an airport 5 minutes from my home and cheat the system?\n\nSo. I stand firm on my statement. Prices do vary depending on where you book it from. You\u2019ll get different flights suggested to you and one has to realize at these booking sites are in the business of making money. They have zero interest in giving you the best prices. They are more interested in suggesting flights that fit the airline\u2019s needs.\nBarflyerdammit: Your two ticket strategy is a good one--well done.  And you can stand by your statement, but I work with the GDS software itself and I promise you that what you're claiming is not true.  \n\nGiven the hundreds of airports and hundreds of thousands of flight combinations, AA doesn't give that much of a crap about adjusting the pricing for one specific route for your specific outbound city.  And if they did, the software platform was built in the 1960's and couldn't do anything about it anyway.  And if it could, Skiplagged.com would just circle around it anyway by offering to issue your ticket in Texas, or maybe even Bosnia, Colombia or Egypt (where the local governments have a prohibition of certain types of airline taxes.)\n\nOf course the OTAs want to make money, but there is a strong disincentive to offer a higher price when the competition won't.  Their interest is in offering the lowest price, because you're buying a commodity and will patronise whoever sells you the cheapest fare--it's the same plane, so you don't care who you buy it from.\n\nThe money an OTA makes on selling a plane ticket is a fraction of what they make selling you the travel insurance or hotel.  Even the $25 airport shuttle voucher has a higher commission than the average plane ticket.\nrichardkim_nyc: So what you\u2019re saying is... my route which is actually suggested by Skiplagged, is not true? That I\u2019m making it up? I\u2019m serious. Take a look. \n\nThey have two options \n- ISP to Orlando to DFW at $205\n- ISP to FLL to DFW at $206\nAnd they don\u2019t require me to skiplag. It\u2019s just a normal, straightforward route with a quick 45 minute layover. \n\nBut when I go to Expedia, those two suggestions are not made. Instead Expedia wants me to take an AA flight from ISP to Philly to DFW with a 6 hour layover at Philly for $668. Why would Expedia not recommend that completely normal route via Florida when it\u2019s cheaper?\n\nWould you not assume it is because they want to make money? It is $400 more. Which is just about the cost of a round trip taxi to JFK... where a ticket to Dallas is $200. \n\nConsider this: why did United Airlines sue Skiplagged for lost revenue?\n\nIsn\u2019t GDS pretty much outdated now? I\u2019m a software engineer myself and I\u2019m fairly sure it is or is going to be soon because of shifts in the industry and business models. Heck, I don\u2019t remember the last time I saw a travel agency.\n\nFor the record, I\u2019m not arguing. This is actually an interesting topic and I\u2019m very curious as to why some people agree and some disagree.\nBarflyerdammit: Ok, a lot to unpack here.  \n\nFirst, your routing.  If you split it into two parts (yourself by going direct, or by SkipLagged) you are getting two separate tickets. If you do the same thing on Expedia, doing two separate searches, you get the exact same results: just under $100 each way on a good day before seats, luggage, carry one, etc.\n\nWhen you search as one itinerary, you get a different set of results.  Why?  The same reason United sued SkipLagged: separate (or partial) tickets one a single itinerary is a logistical and contractual nightmare, and a potential PR and CS disaster.  Spirit has no obligation to Frontier and vice versa.  There's no interline agreements that say they'll check your bags all the way through without having to claim and recheck them, or that if your Frontier flight is late your connecting ticket will be honored on a different Spirit flight without having to buy a new ticket on the spot for full walk up fare.  Most wise fare hackers will leave a ton of extra time between those connections to accommodate this potential problem.  Because of all those restrictions, the legacy carriers don't need to compete head to head, and can price at whatever the market will bear.\n\nThat's not the software messing with you, that's the Revenue Management department messing with you.\n\nRegarding the GDS systems going away, it's not just offline travel agencies that use the GDS systems.  The airlines run them, both Expedia and SkipLagged use them.  They are the conduit between most airlines and their distribution networks.  They're not as ubiquitous as they used to be, but there's no way Nok Air in Thailand is going to maintain a) functional booking software on its own and/or b) direct API connections with the 35000 websites which sell their air travel. \n\n If an airline res software goes down for even a few hours, that's catastrophic on a lot of levels.  Not many are willing to take a chance on new, unproven technology.   And for sales, a middleman is always needed, and the GDSs are pretty well entrenched in that respect, too.  \n\nWe've strayed pretty far from the original idea that your mom can buy the same ticket from Dallas for less than what you're seeing in NY.
