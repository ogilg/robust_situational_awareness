{"full_text": "jackgary118: In Defence of Strong Emergentist Panpsychism\n\nucanttaketheskyfrome: This article provides two reasons to reject physicalism - the theory that we can explain consciousness with only physical entities. First, the \"transparent conceivability\" argument: because we can conceive of a consciousness-less world where physicalism is true, physicalism does not entail consciousness. Second, the knowledge argument: a person with all the data about an experience still \"learns\" something when they actually experience it. These two arguments are supposed to be compelling reasons to reject physicalism. Are they?\n\nThe first argument equates conceivable with possible, but the fact that zombies are conceivable does not mean that they are possible. Even at my most charitable, I do not understand why \"we can imagine a conscious-less world of physicalism\" is any sort of adequate refutation. The fact that we lack the knowledge to find a contradiction between physicalism and the zombie thesis does not mean there isn't one; we should be more reluctant to discard physicalism. To a physicalist, a zombie is nonsensical. It would be like postulating if the concept of \"health\" evaporates if we compare two identical people, and one of them are missing an organ. \"Consciousness\" could simply be an emergent property of the physical interaction of neurons. This does not demand any mental state.\n\nThe second argument is problematic because I don't think Mary \"learns\" something phenomenal. It sounds like she is just seeing new ways to represent facts she already knows. The \"knowledge\" was acquired prior; her experience with red outside the black-and-white-room is not new. We could test this by showing her something non-red, and asking her to identify the content based on what she has learned about red from inside the room. Alternatively, if she couldn't learn the knowledge from in the room, a better way to resolve this problem is to ask whether this is a kind of knowledge that can't be learned from within the room but still physical. Why do we assume this kind of knowledge isn't simply physical knowledge? This rests on how you define \"physicality\". This is just a word game; I can make it so that physicalism can totally account for consciousness by broadening or narrowing the definition to include Mary's knowledge.\n\nedit: word choice, see infra\ndnew: &gt; The fact that zombies are conceivable \n\nI've never seen an argument supporting that p-zombies are conceivable, either. I've just heard people assert that p-zombies are conceivable, without any evidence that they're not logically inconsistent. (And some have given good arguments as to why they're not logically consistent.) And, as you say, even if it were logically consistent, that says nothing about reality.  \"There might be a different universe somewhere in which X happens, therefore X happens.\"\n\nI mean, they're named \"zombies\" for a reason, right?  \"Fred is not alive. He is in every way measurable to science as though he were alive, and no doctor would be able to tell he's not alive, but *really* he doesn't have the essence of life that makes him alive. He just acts that way.\"  If anyone *today* argued that such a thing made sense, we'd scoff.\n\n&gt; The second argument is problematic \n\nThe second argument is also problematic because Mary is asserted to learn something new when she sees red, but that begs the question. The question is \"does Mary learn something new?\" To assert \"Well, yes, obviously\" doesn't actually argue the point.  I assert that Mary's knowledge is so inconceivably vast, so unintuitively complete, that one's intuition about whether or not she learns something is impossible to deduce without carrying out the experiment.\nFlexography: &gt; I've never seen an argument supporting that p-zombies are conceivable, either\n\nIt's not a claim which requires an argument.  If I say \"I can conceive of a blue tennis ball\", what argument could I possibly provide for that?  Sure, I could give some examples of ways that it's logically consistent, but if you are determined to reject my assertion, then I can never satisfy you, because there are an infinite number of considerations I would need to respond to.\nIf, on the other hand, you think that zombies are *not* conceivable, it's up to *you* to demonstrate why.  \n\n&gt;  I assert that Mary's knowledge is so inconceivably vast, so unintuitively complete, that one's intuition about whether or not she learns something is impossible to deduce without carrying out the experiment\n\nA Physicalist *cannot* take this line of argument.  If it is impossible to determine if Mary learned something new, then Physicalism is false.  If Physicalism is true, then there are only physical facts; thus, Mary--who has all of the physical facts--cannot learn something new.  If it is \"impossible to deduce\" whether or not Mary learns something new, Physicalism is false. \nlurkingowl: &gt; If, on the other hand, you think that zombies are not conceivable, it's up to you to demonstrate why.\n\nBecause it contradicts physicalism?\n\nIf your entire knock-out punch against physicalism is just a burden of proof argument, it's not really a knock-out punch or even good logic, it's just rhetoric.\n\nIf it's *not* a burden of proof argument, then you need to actually prove your claims.\nFlexography: The conceivability of zombies does not contradict Physicalism.  A Physicalist can accept that zombies are conceivable, and many do.  \n\nIn any case, it would be sort of suspect to deny that epistemological claim *just because* it went against a prior commitment you had.  That would be really dishonest.  Whether or not something is conceivable is just a claim about what a person can conceive of.  It doesn't mean anything other than *I can conceive of this thing*.  If you're going to say \"*Physicalism is true, therefore it's got to be impossible that zombies are conceivable*\", you're being dishonest because you are not accurately reporting whether or not zombies are conceivable.  You'd be saying \"well, on the version of Physicalism I subscribe to, zombies can't be conceivable, therefore they aren't conceivable\", then that would be putting the cart before the horse--you'd be presupposing a conclusion without argument, and dismissing contrary arguments by just asserting that conclusion, which isn't really how philosophy is done.  \nlurkingowl: You completely skipped my point:\n\nIf all you have is a burden of proof argument, *you haven't proven anything.*\n\nI'll stand by my belief (which you and anyone else who puts forward the conceivability argument agrees with) that the conceivability of zombies contradicts physicalism separately if you like.\nFlexography: Oh, well I addressed that in my first comment, which you were replying to (and sort of in my reply as well....).  Claims about conceivability are just claims about what you can conceive.  They have to do with whether ideas are logically consistent, whether certain things are contradictory, and so on.  If I say \"I can conceive of X\" there is literally no argument I could possibly provide that would convince you that X is actually conceivable.  I would have to run through infinitely-many considerations in order to show that X is consistent.  If you think that X is not internally consistent--that is, that I cannot conceive of X--then it is up to you to show why.  All you need to do is show one contradiction that is internal to X.  \n\nIf something is inconceivable, there's a reason why--that is, if something is inconceivable, then there is something about that thing which *makes it inconceivable*.  The burden of proof is on you to show that it is inconceivable precisely because there is no way to prove that *anything* is conceivable.  How could I possibly prove the a blue tennis ball is conceivable?  If you were determined to reject blue tennis balls, I could never satisfy you, because I cannot possibly go through the infinite number of considerations I would have to respond to.  If, however, you think that blue tennis balls are *not* conceivable, you need to give one reason why.  For example \"tennis balls have felt, but it is logically impossible for felt to be blue, therefore you cannot conceive of a blue tennis ball\" or something like that.  If you can't provide a reason *why* the thing is inconceivable.... well then it's conceivable. \n\nAnd, again, the conceivability of zombies does not contradict Physicalism.  Physicalism is a claim about the world.  It is the claim that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff.  That is the Physicalist thesis.  The conceivability of zombies is not a claim about the world; it is a claim about what we can conceive of.  These things do not contradict each other in any way. \nlurkingowl: You're still not addressing the fact that all you're presenting (the way you're arguing this) is a burden of proof argument against physicalism.  If you're going to bring up conceivability, and try to use it as a point in an argument, you can't turn around in the middle and claim I'm failing a point you've presented no evidence for.  It's perfectly fine to say \"I believe there's a contradiction in there, but we don't understand the terms and processes well enough for me to spell it out.\"\n\n(Physicalism contradicts conceivability in a separate reply.)\nFlexography: We're not even talking about Physicalism at the moment.  We're talking about about what it takes for something to be conceivable.  For any conceivability argument, the burden of proof is *always* on the person who says that it is inconceivable.  If something is inconceivable, then it can be demonstrated that it is inconceivable.  However, it can NEVER be demonstrated that ANYTHING is conceivable. \n\nI've literally said multiple times there there is ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF any person could EVER provide that any X is conceivable such that you could convince someone that X is conceivable.  That's a basic logical fact about consistency.  \n\nInconsistency, on the other hand, does not require an infinite number of proofs.  It requires one--one example of a contradiction.  This is, again, a basic logical fact about inconsistency.  \n\nThe burden of proof is absolutely completely entirely 100% on the person who says that zombies are inconceivable.  \nlurkingowl: No, the burden of proof *in any argument* is 100% on the person making a positive claim.  If I'm not trying to use conceivability as part of an argument to draw a conclusion, I have absolutely no burden of proof.  I can happily continue on being a physicalist until someone figures out a way to make show that zombies are conceivable (or puts forward some other argument.)  The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\nFlexography: Here's an argument:\n\nP1) I can conceive of blue tennis balls\n\nP2) If I can conceive of blue tennis balls, then  blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nC1) Therefore blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\n\nI can offer absolutely no support for (P1) that would convince a skeptic that I can actually conceive of a blue tennis ball.  If you think that there is a burden of proof on me to somehow prove \"I can conceive of a blue tennis ball\" without having any sort of criticism of that claim to respond to, then this argument cannot go through, and we cannot conclude that blue tennis balls are logically consistent.  We can't even conclude that (P1)--that I can conceive of them--is true, since we can't give an argument for it.  But surely that's not right.  This argument is obviously valid, and we want to say that it's sound too.  We know that blue tennis balls are conceivable.  And if someone comes up to you tomorrow and says \"You totally can't conceive of blue tennis balls\", they better have a damn good reason for their assertion.  The burden of proof is on *them*.  *They* have to give a reason why we can't conceive of blue tennis balls.  We certainly think we are conceiving of them.  So if we are mistaken, they need to show why.  \n\n&gt; The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\n\nThis is simply untrue.  Physicalism is by definition a specific claim.  It is the claim that that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff. This is not controversial.  This is the definition of Physicalism. \nlurkingowl: &gt;&gt;The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\n\n&gt;This is simply untrue. Physicalism is by definition a specific claim. It is the claim that that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff. This is not controversial. This is the definition of Physicalism.\n\nYes, Physicalism is a specific claim.  I was saying that the physicalist doesn't need to present a detailed proof that zombies aren't conceivable.  The physicalist *isn't using it as the premise of an argument.*  They can happily say that inconceivability is a conclusion from their premises (plus the conceivability-&gt;metaphysical possibility claim.)  No part of their chain of reasoning depends on it.\n\nChalmers *is* using conceivability as the premise of an argument.  If the premise is false, the whole argument is invalid.\nFlexography: Here's an argument:\n\nP1) I can conceive of blue tennis balls\n\nP2) If I can conceive of blue tennis balls, then blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nC1) Therefore blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nI can offer absolutely no support for (P1) that would convince a skeptic that I can actually conceive of a blue tennis ball.

They have to give a reason why we can't conceive of blue tennis balls. We certainly think we are conceiving of them. So if we are mistaken, they need to show why.  \n\nImagine if this person then said \"I don't need to give a reason why blue tennis balls are inconceivable.  The burden of proof is on you to prove that you can conceive of a blue tennis ball.  And until you do that, I don't have to put forth any argument\".  If that happened, you would not take this person seriously.  You know that it is not your job to prove that blue tennis balls are conceivable if you haven't been given any reason to think otherwise.  This person will *never* accept that blue tennis balls are conceivable, because it is literally impossible for you to prove that they are conceivable, since that would require that you respond to an infinite number of potential criticisms.  Does this mean that blue tennis balls are not conceivable?  *Of course not*. \n", "prompt": "jackgary118: In Defence of Strong Emergentist Panpsychism\n\nucanttaketheskyfrome: This article provides two reasons to reject physicalism - the theory that we can explain consciousness with only physical entities.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: If an online friend frequently apologizes for slow replies over text, what does this imply?\n[deleted]\nPonytail77: I think it implies that the apology really isn't that sincere.  If you are truly sorry you try not to repeat it again.   \n\nThis friend is aware she's ignored your texts and so is trying to be polite by opening her reply repeatedly with a \"I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but...\"  \n\nIt basically shows they're busy and/or have other priorities.\n[deleted]: What she wrote was, \"Hey! Sorry for not answering for a long time - I was on vacation outside the city and there was no connection.\" She was honest about it because I saw from her stories, though when she replied it was like nine days past the New Year and I texted her on NYE. With that being said, my texts have always been very long so whether or not she was sincere it probably didn't matter that much. There's been a general trend of her replying once every week. But I've also noticed that when I wrote something that she didn't felt comfortable answering, for example I asked her if she liked to watch any Halloween movies over Halloween, then she took a longer time to reply and then came back at the end of November and apologized for being very busy (but only after I accidentally liked one of her IG photos which probably sent a notification to her phone). It's true that she was busy with something but no one could have probably been that busy that they would take a long time to reply to a text.\n\nBtw I also confronted her about this and it got really messy. But I get the sense that she wants to send meaningful replies rather than just \"one or two word texts,\" as she put it. So she may not have been sincere with the apology but she is probably sincere with the conversation. But also a part of me can't help but wonder if she feels pressured to apologize for slow replies after I nearly set an ultimatum on the conversation. I mean she's apologized in the past before for slow replies but I get the sense that she is probably going to apologize more often now out of any lingering pressure that she feels from me. I tried my best to move on from the confrontation but when something like that happens it's hard to forget. Now she's been busier with her life than before but yeah, I keep looking at it from my perspective and it's hard to come to terms with it. Like what if this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly..\nPonytail77: \"...this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly\"\n\nFrom what you've said, I think this is the most likely answer. Rather than \"read between the lines\" as they say, she just takes her time in responding -politely of course- hoping you'll get the hint.\n[deleted]: But couldn't that have also been because my texts were very long? Maybe if my texts had been shorter she wouldn't have apologized?\n\nHere's a brief timeline of the texts: She replied on October 23. I replied on November 6. She replied on November 28. I replied on December 24. She replied on December 28. I replied on December 31. She replied on January 9. She started off her replies on November 28 and January 9 with apologies. I have not replied since. I have backed off by a lot already. Is it not enough??\nPonytail77: I would take a break until I heard from her.  Or at least another month or so. \n\nSounds like you want more from this friendship then she is willing or able to give right now.  If she's interested, she can reach out to you at any time too.\n[deleted]: That's what I was thinking too. Not just because she told me that she's starting a new job but also because I am not completely sure if I should open up more in my texts with her. What draws me to her is that she is able to answer in detail, with compassion, and with great energy. It's not like she answers in one to three sentences. Often she answers in five to ten sentences. It's clear that she puts effort into her messages even if her priorities have changed or whatnot, and as a result, I overshare with her sometimes.\n\nBut I am still unsure how much I actually matter to her. Any confrontation that involved making excessive demands would turn people off. Whether or not it's long term remains to be seen. She said she's not mad, and she said she still likes the communication. I believe her, but people can also subtly pull themselves away while still being very polite. Not to mention she lives in a foreign country where the main language isn't English. Of course she has an incentive to communicate in English.\n\nIf I still matter to her in some way or the other, then she'll eventually reach out like she did before. I hate to say this but this is my way of testing her. I hope to take a break and not reply to her until May and continue to do nothing (not watching her stories, not liking any of her posts). If she doesn't reach out again asking how I am doing before then like she used to that should say something about how she actually feels.\nDiabetaBun: \u201cI hope to take a break\u201d I think, is a good start. Not as far as testing her but for your own self. Whether she is being too kind to upkeep her conversation with you, or simply too busy, or find it hard to respond due to language limitations, whatever else the \u201cpossible\u201d explanation could be, it\u2019s always important to refrain from being emotionally codependent with or on another. Coming from a neutral standpoint, you can still have meaningful conversations with her and very much have an \u2018active\u2019 relationship while not expecting too much from it. It is pretty apparent that, at this current time, she is unable to meet your needs. That is okay. There is so much that we can do when it involves another but we do have control on how we choose to handle the situation. I suggest being open to others who can click with you and meet your needs. It won\u2019t minimize the respect you have for your friend and it will increase the respect you have for yourself.\n\nIn regards to the frequent apologies, it\u2019s kind of hard to say. It can be due to insecurities, or fear to disappoint, or it can be because she doesn\u2019t like late responses herself, or, on top of fear to disappoint, she just simply has an active life and she does feel bad to have anyone waiting on her because she believes on being that great friend. If that makes sense\u2026\n[deleted]: There's something else that she mentions more frequently than apologies, and that's starting almost every single text with a \"Hey!\" This is something that she has started doing ever since last October, right around the time when my overbearing attitude went to extremes. Maybe she just happened to pick up something new, but I wonder if using hey consistently is a good thing? I know starting a text with a \"hey\" is great because it's informal, but she's using this on every single text now. Could she be using this to maintain distance?\nDiabetaBun: 1.) Out if curiosity, how long have the two of you known each other? \n\n2.) We\u2019re splitting hairs at this point.\n\n3.) Social Media has downside effects on how people perceive what is appropriate in aspects that involve communication and interpersonal relationships. For example, it becomes an expectation/demand to receive a response. To expound further, if the sender of the text sees that the receiver has indeed seen the text but have not yet responded, it rises the senders anxiety levels which in turn may cause them to over think or over analyze. \n\nI\u2019m not saying anything negative so I hope you don\u2019t take it as such but rather consider this information and do something proactive about your perception on things in regards to sending and receiving texts or what the messages contain. Don\u2019t stress too much about it.\n\nIt seems you really enjoy her company and value her insights and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to distance ourselves from something we see as value. At this point, if it were me in your shoes, I would apologize for the demands I have made because it sets up unrealistic expectations for them and puts some sort of stress on the relationship whether it is big or small. From what you have shared thus far, it\u2019s very minor. So it\u2019s nothing really to worry about. Then I would proceed to share what I value in this relationship and set expectations or guidelines that I know I can live by (nothing on them to do but for myself to do). When that gets done, I would take a step back and just not expect anything else other than what has already been given to be expected. The sooner we can come to accept things for what they are, the sooner we can address the \u201cissue\u201d at hand and move on from it. \n\nJust a precaution, this is advice given by someone who is big on communication and being quite frank and upfront. I don\u2019t like \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d and walking around the bushes. It\u2019s just something I face everyday with people and found it necessary for me to be proactive in eliminating bs. This stuff works for ME and may not necessarily work for everyone.

Meaning if you beat 5 levels and got to all castle but can't beat it, you go back to the previous castle when you load the game. It's meant a lot of redoing levels and it went from the wii version being my families favorite game to the switch version not being used at all.\nfatphotog: The switch nes app has save states, you can literally save at any moment no matter where you are. You start exactly at that moment when you go back. Are you not using the save state function?\nTheKunit: It's not super Mario Brothers nes it's super Mario Brothers deluxe for the switch.\n\nAlso how do I get the nes version? I have only had my switch for a short time. Didn't even know you could get old games like that.\nfatphotog: Oh you mean new super Mario bro\u2019s delux, my bad. You can still quick save where you are on the map in that game. I forget the exact process but I think you just pause and choose quick save. It will make you quit back to the menu but will have a little balloon next to your save file meaning it\u2019s been quick saved and you\u2019ll start right from the point of the map where you quick saved. The original nes version is part of the online subscription that you can pay for. It allows you to have online access in supported games and also comes with a nes channel and a SNES channel. They each have many games from each console you can play anytime as long as you are subbed to Nintendo online. I think it\u2019s like $3 dollars a month or something.\nTheKunit: Unfortunately the quick save function either only works once or has some other odd requirement that it does not tell you about. At this point I've done the beginning of the game up to the second works at least 3 or 4 times and so far it's still forcing me to restart from the world 1 castle. I quick wave every time. Doing some research you are supposed to go back and beat an easy castle so it fully saves the game.

The article is literally saying exactly what I\u2019m saying. This is how the very short article ends: \u201cOnce you reload the save file where the Quick Save occurred, you\u2019ll need to keep quick saving to keep your progress indefinitely before you reach an actual save point.\n\nIf you turn the system off or close the game without Quick Sav, you\u2019ll be sent back to the previous actual save you did\u2014which means you could lose tons of progress that you made through difficult levels.\u201d\nTheKunit: Dude I'm telling you it's not without quick saving like you are trying to make out. You seem hell bent on proving that an internet stranger doesn't understand how to save a freaking video game though so idk what to tell you.

They only gave money to people who were already unemployed. They basically just had a slightly different unemployment/welfare program and didnt study any of the effects of what would happen if you gave money to people who were already doing reasonably well in their finances.\ndid_you_read_it: UBI seems great, when wearing my idealist hat it feels like more than just an amicable goal but one that could signal a next great leap in civilization.  where the Agricultural revolution freed up humanity to pursue more diverse work a UBI could free up humanity to pursue self actualization.  why should society be such that i must spend the bulk of my life working. \n\n\nOTOH I have no idea how it would even work or *if* it could work.  Economy is a funny thing and this could just result in a flat inflation, or even create dystopian lifestyle where the majority subsist in poor government housing, cared for but not really living.  Not to mention that right now we do still need  people to work. As the saying goes \"the world needs ditch diggers too\"\n\n\nI think we won't really see this hit until we move into a post-labor scarcity world.  We have already shifted economics in a time where many products only have artificial scarcity.  Music, movies, programs can all be copied indefinitely, even many physical products have little physical value.   With robotics and AI it seems that eventually we will reach the singularity, where base human labor is obsolete in all but the most niche areas.\nkuhzoo: &gt; UBI seems great, when wearing my idealist hat ...\n\nTo be fair though, that seems like the case for Communism, Capitalism, Democracy, Monarchy, Anarchism, etc.  Just sit back and listen to the tone of an amateur philosopher who's just read a book about one of the above and fallen in love with the idea of it.\n\nPersonally, I'm of the opinion that every system I listed above in it's pure form will fail for various reasons.  Capitalism devolves into monopolies. Communism gets co-opted by greed.  Democracies ham-string great individual leaders. Monarchies are brought down by one bad, or sometimes even mediocre, leader.  Anarchism doesn't really scale with population growth. ... And the flaws keep going.  At that point the solution to the draw-backs of one is to balance it with the benefits and draw-backs of another.  The US has historically been strongly capitalist, but there have often been mitigating communist/socialist policies, like The New Deal, eras with strong unions, etc. too.  \nAt which point we get back to UBI, and I see it as a dose of socialism to try to keep the draw-backs of capitalism in check.  (AFAICT, right now the US is running full steam toward the pure capitalism ending ... which would explain the rise in more socialist ideas.  People are trying to curve us back toward equilibrium.)\n\nOur idealized systems fail when they come into contact with reality where different people have different problems and priorities. Different enough problems and priorities that no one system will adequately support all of them.  Even using multiple systems to balance each other will still cause chafing and strife, but can prevent us from ever catastrophically failing the way, I believe, pure systems inevitably do.  Even the solution of 'balance' fails because someone always wants to unbalance it to get rid of their own pain points (or because they fell in love with an ideal).  \nThere is no one solution.  Like life, it's an ever shifting balance that collapses and fails if it goes too far toward any extreme or it can't adapt to it's changing environment.\ndid_you_read_it: There could be a future solution. Problem really is that all society is a pyramid (at best maybe a box). Under any scheme, doesn't matter if you're communist capitalist or socialist. \n\n\"The world needs ditch diggers too\"  The only difference is who ends up as one and why.\n\n*however* I think eventually we will reach the robotic singularity and we could build a human society where almost nobody is the base of the pyramid.  Propped up on a tireless army of robotic slave labor we could potentially achieve some aspect of these ideal governments. sure there will always be people at the \"bottom\" but when the bottom is 6 layers of robots up from the ground that could be some pretty cushy living.\nkuhzoo: Based on [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/extreme-poverty-america-un-special-monitor-report)^1 I don't think your robotic singularity will happen and if it does, it still won't make the changes you think it will.  There will be people either left behind without robots to support them, or there will still be tasks we can't fully automate that'll require humans down at the very bottom with the robots.  The US is the richest nation in the world by many estimates, and we have citizens living in conditions we would consider 'poor' in a 3rd world nation.\n\nYour ideal of a post-robotic singularity fails for the same reason all the other ideals fail, reality is too messy and inconsistent for everyone to fit into it... and many of those people who don't fit will be necessary to keep it going.\n\n1: warning link does not qualify as 'uplifting'\n", "prompt": "ratskim: Universal basic income seems to improve employment and well-being - The world\u2019s most robust study of universal basic income has concluded that it boosts recipients\u2019 mental and financial well-being, as well as modestly improving employment.\n\nw1n5t0nM1k3y: This study keeps getting cited", "orig": ", but seems to have a major flaw in regards to testing the UBI.

{"full_text": "BrotisBoughtAHouse: Any Roofing Expertise? Please help.\nGreetings Reddit,\n\nMy girlfriend and I recently bought a home in the Midwest, Missouri to be specific.  It's been great, minus my lack of handy experience, but everyone has to start somewhere. \n\nWe had a lot of rain this week and as a result our ceiling sprung a [leek](http://imgur.com/nCSd0bq).  Today I decided to check it out before calling a professional.  The portion of the [roof](http://imgur.com/0Tc9gUd) that is leaking seems to be some sort of metal that is sealed (or is supposed to be).  It is on a dormer that was likely an addition at some point. The rest of the roof is shingled and looks to be in decent shape. \n\nThe problem appears to be the vents in the roof.  Here is:\n*[Vent 1](http://imgur.com/NaWBtS1)\n*[Vent 2](http://imgur.com/Vt7xqAH)\n\nIt is fairly apparent at this point where the water is coming into the house at. I picked away some of the material around Vent 1 and it looks something like this [underneath](http://imgur.com/RvdOKt0). \n\nIt seems that I need to scrape off as much of the weathered sealant as I can and replace the flashing around the vents.  Then reseal the entire dormer portion of the roof with a better product.  Am I right in this methodology or missing something?\n\nSomebody that has experienced this before: what products work best for sealing this type of roof? What about something like [this](http://flexsealproducts.com/shop/liquid/?gclid=CjwKEAjwpfC5BRCT1sKW2qzwqE0SJABkKFKR8vrBSPm1j268gQ3Ni2tXcIO6EmJD-F04Kx3Dj91bFhoC_vnw_wcB)?\nThe appearance in this location isn't very important, as it can't be seen from the ground.\n\nThanks a bunch!\nsomeonesdaddy: I laugh so hard at everyone in this thread that says call a roofer. I laugh even harder at the top comment that says call the previous homeowner and ask him to help pay for it. \n\nThese roof vents are known frequent culprits for leaking and it is no big deal. Clean the area up and apply a rubberized compound or tar. I have even used the rubberized aerosol spray before thus creating a rubber boot.\n\nI like the rubberized product called stop leak. It comes in a one gallon paint can and you apply/shape it with a putty knife. For a complex shape I will wear rubber gloves and mold it by hand. \n\nYou are a homeowner now and welcome to the big leagues.  You can't call someone everytime your toilet is clogged anymore. Go forth and be the master of your castle.\n\nYour average contractor will scare you into turning a small job into a big one. This is especially true if they think the homeowner is not very mechanically savvy. \nAbsolutelyPink: While I agree that a roofing contractor can scare you into turning a small job into a big one, this roof is in bad shape and flat or semi-flat roofing jobs are best left to a professional.  Spraying rubber isn't going to fix this one. \n\nI have roofing experience, but there are specialty products meant for flat roofs that aren't as simply as spraying rubber on the roof. It need to be redone and not just around the vents.\n\nMake sure you call a couple companies for estimates and make sure they specialize in flat roofs.  You can check with mobile home sellers in your area for referrals as well.\n\nYou will also need to fix that drywall.  Odds are, the insulation (if any) above that is wet as well.  The drywall will need replacing at a minimum.  If it's still wet, poke a couple holes in it to let the water drain.\n\nAs a temporary measure, tarp your roof until you get it repaired.\nsomeonesdaddy: I agree with you and your advice is sound. There have been times in my life when I could not afford the proper solution or the best one.\n\nI have made due with patching stuff like this in the past. In Florida where I live the roofing laws are funny because of hurricanes. If anything more than 25% of the roof is damaged you are required to get a whole new roof. \n\nI have seen plenty of good roofs complete torn off because a small section needed repair. These days homeowners are looking for a roofer  that is not going to pull a permit thus requiring inspection. \nAbsolutelyPink: I agree.  I've been in the position where I couldn't afford to have things done properly and made due with what I could afford.  It sucks.  Unfortunately, a roof is not where you want to pinch pennies. Heck, in Nevada we get winds enough to rip off a roof. This roof will leak and leak again until it's redone.  Let's just hope there hasn't been enough damage already, to cause the ceiling or roof to cave in though mold might already be of issue.\nBrotisBoughtAHouse: Thanks for the feedback.  I think I might be able to handle the flashing parts, but as others have pointed out, there are likely greater underlying problems that I don't want to risk.  It's looking like stop leak is the way to go for now for an immediate solution.  Over the next week I plan to get a slew of estimates on a more thorough fix.

I demolished and threw into a rented dumpter the entirety of that plywood/2x4 two days ago (Saturday).

I did this with the attached garage door open and a fan running in the basement. After my DIY remediation in the evening I closed the first floor windows and the garage door and let the fan run overnight to help dry out the basement.\n\nWe awoke this morning and now the house has a crazy strong musky smell. Luckily I suspect the bedroom must have been well sealed off as there was quiet a difference walking out into the hallway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow our first floor really stinks though and I'm worried about the following:\n\n1. I've spread mold to everywhere and now the whole sill of the house, joists, flooring, etc will get moldy (though I think that's unlikely...hopefully?).\n2. That there is ***another*** source of mold which I can't find that I disrupted with the fan and blew around the house (even crawled around the crawl space mentioned below looking for other mold with a flashlight) .\n\nAny thoughts or tips would be appreciated. \n\nBasement background:  most of the basement is walking height with poured concrete floor and relatively well pointed walls, not too bad. Never gets too wet down there though can get humid. The kitchen of the house however sits on a rubble foundation with dirt floor but a vapor barrier sits above the dirt floor. The sealing between the stone and plastic is far from perfect.

Many of these extrajudicial murders were celebratory public spectacles, where thousands of white people, including elected officials and prominent citizens, gathered to witness victims being gruesomely tortured and mutilated. \n\nWhite newspapers advertised these carnival-like events; vendors sold food, photographers printed postcards, and victims\u2019 clothing and body parts were given out as souvenirs.\n\nIn Newnan, Georgia, in 1899, at least 2000 whites watched as a white mob mutilated and burned alive a black man named Sam Hose, and then sold pieces of his organs and bones. \n\nIn 1916, a white mob in Waco, Texas, tortured and lynched a mentallydisabled 17-year-old black boy named Jesse Washington in front of city hall, stripping, stabbing, beating, and mutilating him before burning him alive in front of 15,000 white spectators. Charred pieces of his body were dragged through town, and his fingers and fingernails were taken as keepsakes.\n\nPublic spectacle lynchings were most frequent in the South, but also occurred in Northern and Midwestern states as black Americans migrated during the 20th century. In 1920, 10,000 whites attended the lynchings of three black circus workers in Duluth, Minnesota. \n\nIn Springfield, Missouri, in 1906, two black men, Horace Dunn and Fred Coker, were hanged and shot to death for a crowd of 5000 whites.

The most important thing is that over the last decade, both countries have cratered in terms of home ownership.\n\nWe don't have \"foreigners laundering money\" in the U.S., and if we did, they couldn't do so at a scale which would affect the statistics at this scale. So there must be another cause in the U.S., such as economic inequality. The U.K. figures somewhat bear that out, showing sagging home ownership rates [primarily among those below the age of 34](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/data/housing/).\n\nThe conclusion I draw is that \"foreigners\" likely have little to nothing to do with anything.\nnclh77: Look up Trump and money laundering if you think  there isn't billions being laundered in the US. \nemilyst: Are you proposing that Trump has single-handedly depressed the housing market over the last decade?\nnclh77: Are you saying Trump is responsible for a decade long rise in real estate values? \nemilyst: You mentioned Trump.\nnclh77: You said depressed. \nemilyst: I'm not saying Trump is responsible for anything.\nprinceofwavves: Trump was provided as a single high profile example, like that house in Florida bought by some Russian for $100 million, of the foreign purchase process \nemilyst: Sorry, so, the pieces I'm meant to put together here are, Trump and other rich individuals (not foreign nationals or some other immigrants directly) have been purchasing expensive real estate items using foreign money, and this is a major factor in the decline of home ownership over the last decade?\n\nIf for some reason the influx of foreign money purchased enough real estate to affect the supply and demand curves significantly, wouldn't that constitute a vast conspiracy, given that it's not widely known?

{"full_text": "SweelFor: What is your mid/long term plan for BWF training ?\nHi everyone\n\nFor these past few days I have been thinking about how I would like to structure my training in the mid/long term. I know what my short term training structure is and I know when it's gonna end and I was wondering what I wanted to do next.\n\nCurrently I am finishing Level 1 of Calisthenic Movement's program. There are 5 levels and going through 1 to 5 takes about 1 year and a few months I think.\n\nWhen I'll have completed CM's program I don't think I'll get on skills training. It seems a lot of people start calisthenics and quickly want to start training levers, planche, etc. It seems wiser to me to train basic movements strength for a few years before training the levers or planche. Would you agree ? I like to take some perspective and remind myself that I want to train for strength, looks, etc, but also longevity and I think in 20 years when I'll look back, waiting 2 or 3 years before training hard BW skills will seem like nothing and I'll be happy with my decisions.\n\nI think I'd be interested after CM's program by GMB's floor program to learn basic locomotion movements and develop further body awareness.\n\nAfter that, I don't know.\n\n\nWhat are your plans for future training ? \nJPSYCHC: Start \ngrimgrau: I'm wishing you some luck and sending you good vibes so you can follow through and start working out.\n\nMay I ask what you feel has been keeping you from starting?\nJPSYCHC: I'm coming out of a heroin addiction I am only 10 days clean but I finally feel good physically. \ngrimgrau: 10 days clean from heroin is still a difficult thing to accomplish. Every day, even every hour for a long time past 10 days can stretch on for eternity. I've known many people who became addicted to opiates and opioids and it's really tough. Getting through the withdrawals seems to be like absolute hell.\n\nIf you didn't know already there's an awful lot of research out there that shows that cardiovascular exercise can help a ton with recovery, though. Strength training is also a big help, but from what I've read and heard it's the cardio that seems to do the most good.\n\nIf you can even bring yourself to do just a few exercises at first that'll still be great. You don't necessarily have to do the entire routine the first few times through.\n\nHere's hoping you can continue on the path to recovery. :)\nJPSYCHC: Thanks man. I think I can even though I have failed so many times already. I appreciate this \ngrimgrau: The important thing is that you're trying again even though you haven't succeeded before. Like I said it's really tough to get off of heroin and I know full well that you know that. The addiction is so fucking insidious. The way it hijacks your brain is just evil.\n\nIs it possible that you may be able to get into some sort of medication maintenance program? I know that those programs have pretty strict rules, but I've known some people who were able to get off of the heroin by taking suboxone or methadone for a while and then, eventually, taper off.\n\nSome people need to be on it long-term, but in some cases that can be a lot better than having to go out and think about how to score more heroin. Firstly, it eliminates the illegality of possession and some of the stuff people might do in order to score. Secondly, there's a LOT of cut heroin out there these days. There's no telling what might be in the stuff and with the crap that some people are cutting it with one shot, sniff, or smoke could mean instant death. Fentanyl and carfentanyl are outright instant killers compared to heroin on its own.\n\nWhatever path you choose I wish you the best of luck.\nJPSYCHC: I am on suboxone and in an IOP\n\nMy dope had fent in it, I know because I tested positive for it regularly. But believe it or not in my state, I considered that a good thing. It made it better\n\nThe risk though, regardless of tolerance, is if it isn't mixed well and you get a hot spot. Then even Kurt Cobain would be a dead man. \ngrimgrau: Oh, I completely understand if the dope is stronger than usual even if it's fent, I mean, so long as it isn't the last time you use it of course if you get what I mean. If you use drugs and you get more bang for your buck you're probably going to see that as a bonus no matter which drug it is.\n\nI used to have a huge polysubstance addiction/abuse problem in my mid to late 20's for about 4 years, but my main choice of drug was anything psychedelic. I wasn't addicted to one drug. I was addicted to being altered, preferably on psychedelics. I tripped on so many things so often that to this day I still see motion trails any time something moves and haloes around lights. Fortunately that's it and it doesn't negatively interfere with my life, but when I found a hookup for LSD I ended up doing so much so often I wound up in the emergency room a few times having no fucking clue how I got there. I inherited some $20,000'ish in stocks and I blew almost all of it on LSD, weed, and electronics. Psychedelics aren't even supposed to be addictive. No physical addiction or withdrawal, but I got to the point where I couldn't make it through a week without tripping on something or otherwise getting high. Never messed with meth, cocaine/crack, or opiates though.\n\nI ended up in treatment a few times because of that. That's when I met people who had similar problems or were hooked on other things like heroin. So I know how tough it is. If my addiction had a physical dependence component where I'd go into physical withdrawal and felt like I was dying without getting high man, I don't even know what would have happened to me. It was bad enough that my mind and my emotions SCREAMED for me to need to be under the influence to get through a week or even a few days. SO glad that's in my past now.\n\nIt also doesn't help that it turns out that I also have bipolar disorder, but I've been stable on medications for a very long time now and have been slowly getting my life back in order. Fortunately for me I've been heading down a very good path for a long time, but I understand what it's like to be addicted and to be in treatment and everything. I've met some cool people along the way and hadn't seen them for years only to find out that they're no longer here.\n\nApart from finding medications that keep me 100% stable and fine, exercise has helped me through BIG TIME and ever since I've been regularly exercising in some way, at the very least always doing some sort of cardio.\n\nIf you ever have any questions about bodyweight fitness or just need to talk feel free to hit me up. I've been doing bodyweight exercise for 2 and 1/2 years now and I'm about to turn 35. I'm getting older and I'm at the point where I can't even imagine partying anymore. I need my sleep! I'm happy to answer any of your questions about this stuff or to just read whatever you have to say. If you don't feel comfortable replying in a comment you can send me a private message.\n\nIf there's anything that I can do to help no matter how small it is I feel like in some way I've been through some of the same shit and I'll respond to you even if it takes me a few days (I'm not always online.)\n\nTake care!\n", "prompt": "SweelFor: What is your mid/long term plan for BWF training?\nHi everyone\n\nFor these past few days I have been thinking about how I would like to structure my training in the mid/long term.

That being said, no one truly knows your potential and what you can achieve. Humans are adaptable to incredible levels.  I have seen some amazing stuff so far(logic defying stuff) and I hope to see more. \nPJ_GRE: I study mechanical engineering, this sounds really interesting. Know where I could read more into this? I suppose that torque calculations won't be straightforward given the complexity of the human body.\nThey_call_me_Doctor: There are some good books on the subject. I think one is Human biomechanics or smth like that. You can google it. Its not easy at all but its a good reference point. I mean, when I did it few years back i found that local amount of muscle mass(eg upper arm or calf) can throw off the result significantly yet there is no accurate way to measure everything precisely. But as long as you have lever lengths and ratios its still decent amount of info, as long as you take into account amount of error and deviations. I wish there was an algorithm that could compute it all but as far as I know there still isnt.\nPJ_GRE: [Biomechanical Basis of Human Movements](https://www.amazon.com/Biomechanical-Basis-Movement-Joseph-Hamill/dp/1451177305/ref=zg_bs_226509_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=T2PJV8DW5SQRWK4PHQC4#customerReviews) by chance?\n\n&gt; when I did it few years back i found that local amount of muscle mass(eg upper arm or calf) can throw off the result significantly \n\nCan you expand on what you mean by this?\n\n&gt;I wish there was an algorithm that could compute it all but as far as I know there still isnt. \n\nThat sounds like a super fun project, I'll look into it\nThey_call_me_Doctor: I tried to make a scalable model for some bw exercises based on length measures(proportions) but if falls short cause distribution of muscle mass can be significant factor and change torque numbers. An inch (or) more around calf(or thigh) can significantly change torque at lets say front lever. No one adds 20kg ankle weights but 1 or at most 2kg to planche or front lever and it makes it a lot harder. Or it can be more like general tendency for a person to carry a lot of (muscle) mass at the certain parts of the body making some exercises more or less challenging in addition to lever lengths or proportions. Two inches doesnt look like much around calf but it is significant volume. Same thing with waist width and thigh circumference. \nPJ_GRE: Interesting. You had quite an advanced model if you were accounting for all those factors. I was aiming  to simplify extremities as tapered cylinders.\nThey_call_me_Doctor: Yeah but I didnt get very far, lost interest cause further down the rabbit hole(length and segmentation of the spine, rib cage shape and volume, rotation  forces at a joint, balance, 500 muscles...) it gets super complex. Its definitely a good start and can be helpful to many people. :) \nXerxes_II: Biomechanics is an interesting subject. It signifies just how varied human bodies are, like trying to find the Young's Moduli of bone - nothing like the precision you can find for any man-made material.

There are a couple of branches off the main water line to our bathroom and kitchen before it reaches the water heater/utility room. I've read you want to install the softener right next to the main entry point for the water. This is not possible in my house so what is the next best thing?  \n2. I would want to leave our drinking water and outside spigots off the softener, so those would have to be looped out?\n3. Is it ok to just install the softener before the heater and not soften the cold water going to our bathroom/kitchen? or would it be stupid to do that and should I just soften the whole house?\n4. What is the ideal way to plumb to this softener based on the diagram below? Maybe I am just overcomplicating this.\n\nI feel good about doing the actual work, I would really like to confirm i am doing it the right way before i go through with it though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r8cp95lmxq41.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c553b8a676c855b82224eefb2905259b0a87ef1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idqc02ajmxq41.jpg?width=1724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec264596d6cd6c8feb6e6bdb6c9fac134d18805e\nTobyChan: I\u2019m in the UK so take what I say with a pinch of salt (did you see what I did there?)\n\nOver here it\u2019s normal to soften the water for the whole house expect you must leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap.  I would also leave any outdoor taps unsoftened so that you can water plants with untreated water.\nGrimResistance: &gt; leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap\n\nWhy is this?\nTobyChan: So you\u2019re not drinking and cooking with salty water\njohnwayne2413: Soft water is perfectly okay to drink.  I ran the numbers.\n\nTypically, water softeners add 46 mg/ liter of sodium for every 100 mg/liter of hardness minerals present in the water.\n\nThe grain per gallon (gpg) is a unit of water hardness defined as 1 grain (64.8 milligrams) of calcium carbonate dissolved in 1 US gallon of water (3.785412 L)\n\nThat works out to 17.11834802 mg calcium carbonate per liter of water.\n\nMy water is 18 grains hardness (which is very hard) so:\n\n    18 * 17.11834802 mg = 308.1302644 mg\n\nThe softener will add 141.7399216 mg sodium to 1 Liter of water (\\~34 ounces).\n\n    46 mg/L Na / 100 mg/L CaCO\u2083 = x / 308.1302644 mg CaCO\u2083\n    100x = 14,173.99 mg/L Na\n    x = 141.7399216 mg/L Na\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day\u2014that's equal to about 1 teaspoon of table salt!\n\nThis is how much water you would have to drink per day to exceed your salt intake:\n\n    (2,300 mg / 141.7399216 mg) * 34 ounces = 551 ounces of water per day\n\nIf you drank that much water in a day, ironically, you would die from hyponatremia (dilution of sodium in your blood) before you died from hypertension.\n\nTest your water hardness with a proper kit, the dropper kind, not the strips.  If your water is less hard than 18 grains then your safety margin is even higher.\n\nMost people should worry about eating potato chips or french fries adding too much salt to their body than drinking softened water.\nTobyChan: Again\u2026 read my caveat, I\u2019m from the UK and we have a limit on the sodium content on potable water supply.  Also, you have to appreciate that hardness is a relative term.  I\u2019ve seen borehole supplies that have been softened to the limit which still remain very hard.

{"full_text": "Kavec: What if PETA was wrong and its consequences.\nI am talking about the typical discussion: why People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) do not want people to harm animals but they are OK with eating plants.\n\nThe answers about that are akin to \"duh! killing a plant is not the same thing as killing an animal!\", but they kind of avoid the interesting points:\nhttp://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/why-is-it-ok-to-eat-plants-and-not-animals/\n\nNevertheless this article hits the nail on the head when it enunciates the subject of the discussion:\n\n&gt; But what if we don\u2019t know enough about plants? It\u2019s easy to understand why this discussion could lead someone who enjoys eating meat and other animal products to conclude that we might as well eat animals, since not eating them could lead us down a ridiculous slippery slope where we might not be able to eat anything. Such a conclusion, unfortunately amounts to nothing more than an excuse to justify our consumption of animals. \n\nMy guess on the matter is a little bit difficult for me to explain but I'll do my best (specially not being English my mothertongue, not at all):\n\nLots of people are able to stare at a dead fish and feel nothing, but when they see a dead dog and they feel realy bad. I think this happens because for an average human it is easier to relate to a mammal than to a fish, both being ~~human~~ living beings. What if we go farther away from the mammals. What if we talk about plants: we feel a little bit bad if a big tree is cut down, because some of us can relate to that as we are both of us human beings. But I think most of us agree that this reaction is, in average, a lot less stressful than someone cutting a dog in front of us.\n\nWe can observe in life that dying is most likely an stressful experience for all living beings, in some way or another. Keeping that in mind, let's go even farther: bacteria, body cells, etc. One might presume that they fight against death as furiously as a person who is drowning and is fighting for some air. Does it mean that antibiotics are unethical?\n\nFor me the solution to this puzzle is to change the formulation of \"Ethical Treatment\" (as in PETA) which is usually understood as \"avoiding pain\" to other living beings. IMO, what we really want to avoid is **our own pain**. Thus if you allow other humans to get hurt, you feel you will be likely to get hurt as well. Same thing goes with animals: if you allow people to hurt animals which we relate to, it is easy that these people get insensible also to human suffering. With plants this risk is very little, this is why PETA would not care about people eating vegies.\n\nDoes it make sense? Any ideas on the matter?\n\n---\n\n**Edit**: I agree with the general argument that \"plants have no nervous system\", but I still would not be sure that this means that they have no feelings. I would like to add some relevant information to this discussion:\n\nVery relevant: TED Talk, The roots of plant intelligence http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/stefano_mancuso_the_roots_of_plant_intelligence.html\n\nAskscience: Are bugs able to feel pain? http://ww.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ib81m/are_bugs_able_to_feel_pain/\n\n**Edit2**: I am not saying that it is OK to be cruel to animals. Not in the least. I am just wondering if the typical moral arguments that support it are flawed, and discussing some alternatives.\n\nIn the ancient times, people would not consider a tree as a living being. Now we do. Some centuries ago almost no one would believe that animals had feelings. Now we do. Our understanding and perception about the matter varies over the time.\nbobbaphet: The consequences would be irrelevant, even if plants had feelings. The reason why is because it would be completely unreasonable to not eat plants. The typical moral argument is not flawed even if plants did have feeling because the only other alternative would be to starve yourself to death, *which is completely and totally unreasonable*. Only an insane person would think otherwise. Whether or not plants have feelings is irrelevant.\njohnbentley: &gt; even if plants did have feeling because the only other alternative would be to starve yourself to death, which is completely and totally unreasonable.\n\nWhat if the plants where not only conscious but self conscious?\nbobbaphet: So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\njohnbentley: Yes.\n\nIf you develop a condition where you need a heat transplant, and none are available from the organ donor list, it would be immoral to kill another (adult) human so that you might live. The wrongness doesn't lie in species membership, it lies in that other (adult) humans are self conscious.\nbobbaphet: &gt;Yes.\n\nwhich is completely and totally unreasonable. Only an insane person would think otherwise.\n\njohnbentley: But you don't address the heart transplant case.\nbobbaphet: Yes, I usually don't address irrelevant things.\njohnbentley: Why is it not relevant?\nbobbaphet: Because regardless of what is true, not eating plants is not an option, unless you are insane and suicidal...\njohnbentley: That is possibly the most intellectually dishonest response I've come across.\nbobbaphet: \"Yes you should not eat plants if they are conscious\", is what the most intellectually dishonest response is. That is totally ludicrous!\njohnbentley: I never made that claim, and that you are back there demonstrates your intellectual dishonesty.\nbobbaphet: Yes you did. \n\nI said: \"So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\" \n\nYour response was: \"Yes\". \n\nYou are the one being intellectually dishonest here. Or perhaps you just forgot you said that? \n\n\n\njohnbentley: I forgot nothing. Your recent reference \"if they are conscious\", not \"if they were self conscious\".\n\n\n\n\nbobbaphet: So if they are conscious OR self conscious, we should starve ourselves to death?...Nonsense either way.\njohnbentley: That this is not my view is further evidence of your intellectual laziness.\nbobbaphet: If that is the case, then you should have not said \"Yes\" to the question...\njohnbentley: I answered \"Yes\" to\n\n&gt; So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\n\nI didn't answer yes to \n\n&gt; if they are conscious OR self conscious, we should starve ourselves to death?\n\nI'd like to know what criteria you have for judging it morally permissible to take or save a life. If it species membership then we have nothing left to discuss.\nbobbaphet: &gt;I answered \"Yes\" to So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\n\nExactly, which is completely and totally ridiculous...\n.\njohnbentley: It may well be ridiculous but the intellectually honest course is to say why. One way to say why is to show why some other criteria is the right, and vastly superior, one.\nbobbaphet: &gt;It may well be ridiculous but the intellectually honest course is to say why.\n\nBecause you are advocating **committing suicide**..**.Which is insane**... I thought that part was obvious...but I guess not... Get back to me when you want to have a **reasonable** discussion...\njohnbentley: But I addressed the argument from committing suicide (in the sense of letting yourself die rather than kill others) in the heart transplant case. You ignored it. You seem to be a bigot, having entrenched ideas that you shy away from examining.\nbobbaphet: I ignored it because it's irrelevant because committing suicide is literally insane... Like I said, I am only interested in reasonable discussions. You are simply being unreasonable. \njohnbentley: So you think a healthy person should be killed so their organs should be distributed to save the lives of others (who will die without the new organs) so they don't have to commit suicide (the sense in which you are using \"commit suicide\")?\n\nIf that is your position it is unorthodox and immoral.\nbobbaphet: Nope, no one should be killed to save another, unless you are talking about committing suicide because you don't want to kill plants...talk about unreasonable...\njohnbentley: &gt; Nope, no one should be killed to save another.\n\nRight, then why would it be right to kill a plant, who counts as one if they are self conscious, to save the lives of others?\n\nIf they don't count as one in virtue of self consciousness what criteria do you use before a being counts as deserving the right to life?\nbobbaphet: I already answered that but you just can't understand it...\njohnbentley: Point to your answer.\nbobbaphet: &gt;because committing suicide is literally insane...\njohnbentley: But you are happy for those who have faulty organs to commit suicide rather than kill another for their healthy organs.\n\nYou believe your own position to be insane.\nbobbaphet: That is quite literally the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard...\njohnbentley: That's question begging.\nbobbaphet: No it isn't. It's my opinion of your statements...\njohnbentley: The question is (at least one form of it) \"Why is self consciousness as a criteria for the saving or taking of life wrong?\"\n\nJust asserting that self consciousness is the wrong criteria (by calling it \"insane\") is not anywhere near an attempt to explain why. That is what makes it question begging. \n\nAny attempts by me to have you get at the details end up with you studiously avoiding those details. It is as if you but your fingers in your ears and just shout: \"It's insane, it's insane\". \n\nI illustrate why no one can seriously hold the view in some cases letting your self die ('committing suicide' as you characterise it, a plausible characterisation) rather than take the life of another is morally good. But you persist with \"committing suicide is literally insane\".\nbobbaphet: You're insane. Seek professional help.\njohnbentley: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem\nbobbaphet: If you actually knew what Ad hominem was, you wouldn't be saying that. Ad hominem can only occur in the context of an argument. I was not making an argument, I was just telling you you should seek professional help because you're insane. \njohnbentley: Your response to my argument is to characterise it as so wrong to be evidence of insanity. Your response is paradigmatic ad hominem. Whether I'm insane or not has no bearing on the truth of my claims or the validity of my argument.\nbobbaphet: I don't care about your argument. I'm just saying you're insane. :)\njohnbentley: Then it's a plain old non sequitur.\nbobbaphet: So what?\njohnbentley: It is irrelevant.\nbobbaphet: Yes, your arguments are irrelevant, I agree.\njohnbentley: No your claim of insanity is.\nbobbaphet: No it isn't.\njohnbentley: Yes, this is the meaning of a non sequitur. The conclusion in no way follows from the premises. \nbobbaphet: Is this an actual person talking? or some alien robot computer?\njohnbentley: That still doesn't address the issue. Your intellectual dishonesty is complete. Your next move is to try and claim to be a troll, to make it seem that you really could explain your sincere views if you wanted to.\nbobbaphet: It's wrong to not eat plants because not doing so would kill yourself. What part about that can you not understand? It's quite simple, a 5th grader could understand it. Holy god man...\njohnbentley: But it is not always wrong to kill yourself. The organ case shows that. In the organ case why is it not wrong to kill yourself?\nbobbaphet: Completely false. Dying from a failed organ is not the same as killing yourself. It's dying from a failed organ...\njohnbentley: At last! Some progress!\n\nYou can differentiate \"killing yourself\" or \"commit suicide\" from letting yourself die. If by \"committing suicide\" or \"killing yourself\" you mean taking active steps to end your life then this (edit: is) plausibly different from letting yourself die by failing to act. This second kind of death we could call \"death by omission\".\n\nDying from a failed organ is death by omission, you don't kill another human and you therefore die. So too in the plant case, you don't kill a plant and therefore you die.\n\nBoth cases are death by omission.\n\n\nbobbaphet: You can twist it around however you see fit, your statements are still totally ridiculous. Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: Why would one case by death by omission and not the other?\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\n\nCommon sense: \"sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts.\", \"\"the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way\"\n\nSomething that you are lacking.\njohnbentley: If both cases aren't death by omission (you've been good in allowing the assumption that there are no alternatives to a plant sourced diet) it should be very easy for you to say why, using common sense or whatever you like.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: Repeating that phrase just reveals your unwillingness to address the point made. A point made clearly and plainly. \n\nIt could be because you start to feel the weakness of your own position but I think it more likely that you are unused to the most basic level of intellectual enquiry.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: So if you are very young, you don't have to wait for your faculties to mature to start exercising basic thinking and arguing skills. You could join a local book reading club, for example, in order to become used to addressing and discussing issues. \n\nAt the moment you are incapable of disagreement.

{"full_text": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for. Rather, I have once heard of a study citing that skipping breakfast can trigger an insulin response which would immediately store any and all calories ingested throughout the day into fat. \n\n\nDoes this have any credibility behind it? Does skipping breakfast help your weight loss personally? \nscreepatrol: Any studies that have weird findings about skipping meals or eating 8 meals a day or whatever are either 1) paid for their results by the industry or 2) terribly controlled. \n\nEat once a day. Eat 8 times a day. Eat only during a certain period or snack all day. Your body is great at partitioning calories and the effects of when you eat that food are somewhere between negligible and nonexistent. \n\nToo often people look at what professional bodybuilders/weightlifters/strongmen do and think that's how you succeed. Those guys are at the top level and the only thing left is to focus on the last 1%. The other 99% is controlling your calories/macros and progressive overload in training. \n\nDon't overthink this. \nSpicyThingy: Its not about the calories. Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000% which leads to better fat burning and better muscle growth. That doesnt have to do with sponsorships, it is just measureing. \nNihilii: &gt; increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over\n\nSo is it up to, or is it over? Or does \"up to over 1000%\" mean anywhere between 0 and infinity? I mean that would surely be correct, but not very useful.\n\nAnd do you have any source for those revelations?\nSpicyThingy: Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass. \nNihilii: &gt;Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass.\n\nWell, it's not my first language either, and \"up to and over\" is a classic marketing spiel (that crops up not just in english), which is why I'm giving you attitude for doing it. \n\nBut to the point - your own source, a single study mind you, so not a very strong ground to declare something as a hard fact, has found a 1000% increase in mean GH level after **5 days of fasting**. They were also **injecting the subjects with Growth-Hormone Releasing Hormone**. Based on that you say this:\n\n&gt;Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\nSo even forgetting that slip of the tongue there, you are still clearly suggesting that just intermittent fasting can give you a tenfold GH increase. This is naive at best, and purposefully misleading at worst. How can you consider that study in any way comparable to a person doing something like a typical 16/8 intermittent fasting schedule? \n\nSeriously. You either haven't read the paper you linked or you're sensationalizing this on purpose. I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nYou don't get to pull the asshole card when you're lying to people.\nthoughtihadanacct: While the 1000% claim by u/SpicyThingy may be an exaggeration (deliberate or not I can\u2019t say), it is also unfair of you to entirely discredit the study he cited based on the reasons you have given.\n\nIn figures 2 and 3 and table 1 of the study, it clearly shows that GH concentration increases from fasting even on day 1. Yes the effect on day 1 may be lower than on day 5, and again the 1000% claim may have been misleading. However you seem to be implying that the benefits of fasting with regard to HGH only happen after 5 days, and you claim that the study in no way has bearing on 16:8 fasting. The fact that there is some (albeit lower) effect on day 1 of fasting suggests that 16/8 fasting may have some benefits (albeit lower than say 5 day fasting).\n\nYou boldly state that the reserchers injected the subjects with GHRH, in an attempt to discredit the study. This was dishonest. While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed. And from fig 2 the effects of the injection do not last more than about 3 hours. The injections were done to investigate the effect of fasting on GHRH sensitivity. (True the study could have been \u201cbetter\u201d by focusing on only one thing at a time, but it stands that the injections don\u2019t negate the findings regarding GH release.)\n\nIn the end what Im saying is that it\u2019s not binary - ie it\u2019s not \u201cfasting results in 1000% increase in GH\u201d vs \u201cbullshit the study is meaningless/useless\u201d. What I\u2019m arguing is that fasting does increase GH levels to some extent. More (longer) fasting results in more increase. The exact magnitude of increase is variable and probably differs from person to person.\nNihilii: I never said the study is meaningless. I said what the guy said was misleading and even the single study he picked to support his position does not do so. You can't just sling around some numbers from a study without looking at the context. This was an extremely sloppy attempt at backing one's claims with science.\n\n&gt;While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed.\n\nWell, that's my bad then. It was not clear to me from the study design that the post-GHRH injection measurements were not included in the later analysis and I can't honestly say I read the thing front-to-back since it was pretty late that night. In-depth analysis of this study was not my point though, as I said.\nthoughtihadanacct: \u201cthe single study he picked to support his position does not do so.\u201d\n\nDepends what (you think) his position is. If his position is literally that fasting for 16 hours a day increases GH levels by 1000% in every human being, then yes the study does not support it. However if we are a bit more generous and assume his position is that fasting \u201csignificantly\u201d increases GH level in general, then I believe the study does support that position to some extent.\n", "prompt": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would", "orig": "usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for.
