{"full_text": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello! I am trying to install a water softener in our basement, in the utility room next to our water heater. I have a couple of questions before cutting into the plumbing. I created a diagram and included a picture below. You can access the diagram here and make edits if you'd like to help me confirm plumbing layout.

There are a couple of branches off the main water line to our bathroom and kitchen before it reaches the water heater/utility room. I've read you want to install the softener right next to the main entry point for the water. This is not possible in my house so what is the next best thing?  \n2. I would want to leave our drinking water and outside spigots off the softener, so those would have to be looped out?\n3. Is it ok to just install the softener before the heater and not soften the cold water going to our bathroom/kitchen? or would it be stupid to do that and should I just soften the whole house?\n4. What is the ideal way to plumb to this softener based on the diagram below? Maybe I am just overcomplicating this.\n\nI feel good about doing the actual work, I would really like to confirm i am doing it the right way before i go through with it though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r8cp95lmxq41.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c553b8a676c855b82224eefb2905259b0a87ef1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idqc02ajmxq41.jpg?width=1724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec264596d6cd6c8feb6e6bdb6c9fac134d18805e\nTobyChan: I\u2019m in the UK so take what I say with a pinch of salt (did you see what I did there?)\n\nOver here it\u2019s normal to soften the water for the whole house expect you must leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap.  I would also leave any outdoor taps unsoftened so that you can water plants with untreated water.\nGrimResistance: &gt; leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap\n\nWhy is this?\nTobyChan: So you\u2019re not drinking and cooking with salty water\njohnwayne2413: Soft water is perfectly okay to drink.  I ran the numbers.\n\nTypically, water softeners add 46 mg/ liter of sodium for every 100 mg/liter of hardness minerals present in the water.\n\nThe grain per gallon (gpg) is a unit of water hardness defined as 1 grain (64.8 milligrams) of calcium carbonate dissolved in 1 US gallon of water (3.785412 L)\n\nThat works out to 17.11834802 mg calcium carbonate per liter of water.\n\nMy water is 18 grains hardness (which is very hard) so:\n\n    18 * 17.11834802 mg = 308.1302644 mg\n\nThe softener will add 141.7399216 mg sodium to 1 Liter of water (\\~34 ounces).\n\n    46 mg/L Na / 100 mg/L CaCO\u2083 = x / 308.1302644 mg CaCO\u2083\n    100x = 14,173.99 mg/L Na\n    x = 141.7399216 mg/L Na\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day\u2014that's equal to about 1 teaspoon of table salt!\n\nThis is how much water you would have to drink per day to exceed your salt intake:\n\n    (2,300 mg / 141.7399216 mg) * 34 ounces = 551 ounces of water per day\n\nIf you drank that much water in a day, ironically, you would die from hyponatremia (dilution of sodium in your blood) before you died from hypertension.\n\nTest your water hardness with a proper kit, the dropper kind, not the strips.  If your water is less hard than 18 grains then your safety margin is even higher.\n\nMost people should worry about eating potato chips or french fries adding too much salt to their body than drinking softened water.\nTobyChan: Again\u2026 read my caveat, I\u2019m from the UK and we have a limit on the sodium content on potable water supply.  Also, you have to appreciate that hardness is a relative term.  I\u2019ve seen borehole supplies that have been softened to the limit which still remain very hard.  If an untreated supply to the kitchen was added they could have softened the water further and actually got some benefit from the treatment!\n", "prompt": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello!

When you load your profile it only takes you to the last caslte you beat. Meaning if you beat 5 levels and got to all castle but can't beat it, you go back to the previous castle when you load the game. It's meant a lot of redoing levels and it went from the wii version being my families favorite game to the switch version not being used at all.\nfatphotog: The switch nes app has save states, you can literally save at any moment no matter where you are. You start exactly at that moment when you go back. Are you not using the save state function?\nTheKunit: It's not super Mario Brothers nes it's super Mario Brothers deluxe for the switch.\n\nAlso how do I get the nes version? I have only had my switch for a short time. Didn't even know you could get old games like that.\nfatphotog: Oh you mean new super Mario bro\u2019s delux, my bad. You can still quick save where you are on the map in that game. I forget the exact process but I think you just pause and choose quick save. It will make you quit back to the menu but will have a little balloon next to your save file meaning it\u2019s been quick saved and you\u2019ll start right from the point of the map where you quick saved. The original nes version is part of the online subscription that you can pay for. It allows you to have online access in supported games and also comes with a nes channel and a SNES channel. They each have many games from each console you can play anytime as long as you are subbed to Nintendo online. I think it\u2019s like $3 dollars a month or something.\nTheKunit: Unfortunately the quick save function either only works once or has some other odd requirement that it does not tell you about. At this point I've done the beginning of the game up to the second works at least 3 or 4 times and so far it's still forcing me to restart from the world 1 castle. I quick wave every time. Doing some research you are supposed to go back and beat an easy castle so it fully saves the game. I don't know why a basic save function is so difficult for Nintendo to figure out but it's infuriating. Super Mario party is the same way. You can't save in the game at all. If you quit during a game it's gone for good.\nfatphotog: When you\u2019re done playing, if you have gone a couple levels since the last castle or mushroom house, just quick save..Next time you want to play you start where you quick saved.\nTheKunit: OK but I've done that. If you have to play multiple sessions between castles it won't save more than the one time.\nfatphotog: I don\u2019t understand, just quick save again?\n\n*edit  Do you mean once you restart from a quick save you lose all your lives before beating a castle or finding a mushroom house? Yes if you lose all your lives after starting from a quick save, you will start at your last *real* save point. It\u2019s very, very difficult in this game to actually lose all your lives imo.\nTheKunit: https://www.gamepur.com/guides/nsmbu-deluxe-how-to-save\n\nThis is a good descriptor of the issue\nfatphotog: Right, and that article clearly states that if you don\u2019t quick save again, which is all you\u2019ll have to do, you go back to your last \u201creal\u201d save. Which is exactly what I said.\nTheKunit: Basically if you turn off the switch or put in another game the quick save function doesn't work\nfatphotog: Yes, so don\u2019t do that? The article is literally saying exactly what I\u2019m saying. This is how the very short article ends: \u201cOnce you reload the save file where the Quick Save occurred, you\u2019ll need to keep quick saving to keep your progress indefinitely before you reach an actual save point.\n\nIf you turn the system off or close the game without Quick Sav, you\u2019ll be sent back to the previous actual save you did\u2014which means you could lose tons of progress that you made through difficult levels.\u201d\nTheKunit: Dude I'm telling you it's not without quick saving like you are trying to make out. You seem hell bent on proving that an internet stranger doesn't understand how to save a freaking video game though so idk what to tell you. It's not like I've been playing video games for my entire life and know how to do basic shit like saving, pressing the menu button, or jumping.\n\nI also need help getting my undies on after my nurse assisted shower.\n\nGood riddance\nfatphotog: Holy shit bro, I\u2019m not being rude at all. I\u2019m just answering your questions. The article you posted says literally the exact same thing that I am saying. Just don\u2019t turn the game off or put in another game without quick saving first. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know what else to say. I mean it\u2019s not hard at all to understand, so now I am going to be condescending, because you are clearly stupid.

Economy is a funny thing and this could just result in a flat inflation, or even create dystopian lifestyle where the majority subsist in poor government housing, cared for but not really living.  Not to mention that right now we do still need  people to work. As the saying goes \"the world needs ditch diggers too\"\n\n\nI think we won't really see this hit until we move into a post-labor scarcity world.  We have already shifted economics in a time where many products only have artificial scarcity.  Music, movies, programs can all be copied indefinitely, even many physical products have little physical value.   With robotics and AI it seems that eventually we will reach the singularity, where base human labor is obsolete in all but the most niche areas.\nkuhzoo: &gt; UBI seems great, when wearing my idealist hat ...\n\nTo be fair though, that seems like the case for Communism, Capitalism, Democracy, Monarchy, Anarchism, etc.  Just sit back and listen to the tone of an amateur philosopher who's just read a book about one of the above and fallen in love with the idea of it.\n\nPersonally, I'm of the opinion that every system I listed above in it's pure form will fail for various reasons.  Capitalism devolves into monopolies. Communism gets co-opted by greed.  Democracies ham-string great individual leaders. Monarchies are brought down by one bad, or sometimes even mediocre, leader.  Anarchism doesn't really scale with population growth. ... And the flaws keep going.  At that point the solution to the draw-backs of one is to balance it with the benefits and draw-backs of another.  The US has historically been strongly capitalist, but there have often been mitigating communist/socialist policies, like The New Deal, eras with strong unions, etc. too.  \nAt which point we get back to UBI, and I see it as a dose of socialism to try to keep the draw-backs of capitalism in check.  (AFAICT, right now the US is running full steam toward the pure capitalism ending ... which would explain the rise in more socialist ideas.  People are trying to curve us back toward equilibrium.)\n\nOur idealized systems fail when they come into contact with reality where different people have different problems and priorities. Different enough problems and priorities that no one system will adequately support all of them.  Even using multiple systems to balance each other will still cause chafing and strife, but can prevent us from ever catastrophically failing the way, I believe, pure systems inevitably do.  Even the solution of 'balance' fails because someone always wants to unbalance it to get rid of their own pain points (or because they fell in love with an ideal).  \nThere is no one solution.  Like life, it's an ever shifting balance that collapses and fails if it goes too far toward any extreme or it can't adapt to it's changing environment.\ndid_you_read_it: There could be a future solution. Problem really is that all society is a pyramid (at best maybe a box). Under any scheme, doesn't matter if you're communist capitalist or socialist. \n\n\"The world needs ditch diggers too\"  The only difference is who ends up as one and why.\n\n*however* I think eventually we will reach the robotic singularity and we could build a human society where almost nobody is the base of the pyramid.  Propped up on a tireless army of robotic slave labor we could potentially achieve some aspect of these ideal governments. sure there will always be people at the \"bottom\" but when the bottom is 6 layers of robots up from the ground that could be some pretty cushy living.\nkuhzoo: Based on [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/extreme-poverty-america-un-special-monitor-report)^1 I don't think your robotic singularity will happen and if it does, it still won't make the changes you think it will.  There will be people either left behind without robots to support them, or there will still be tasks we can't fully automate that'll require humans down at the very bottom with the robots.  The US is the richest nation in the world by many estimates, and we have citizens living in conditions we would consider 'poor' in a 3rd world nation.\n\nYour ideal of a post-robotic singularity fails for the same reason all the other ideals fail, reality is too messy and inconsistent for everyone to fit into it... and many of those people who don't fit will be necessary to keep it going.\n\n1: warning link does not qualify as 'uplifting'\n", "prompt": "ratskim: Universal basic income seems to improve employment and well-being - The world\u2019s most robust study of universal basic income has concluded that it boosts recipients\u2019 mental and financial well-being, as well as modestly improving employment.\n\nw1n5t0nM1k3y: This study keeps getting cited, but seems to have a major flaw in regards to testing the UBI.

{"full_text": "Rob_Rogers: Poor Man's Bankruptcy\nWhat do you do if you get in way over your head in debt. Bankruptcy is one path but it is has a cost since you need to hire an attorney and go through the court process. That court process is intimidating and public. One viable approach is to simply walk away. Being broke is not criminal and both parties (bank and you) agree from the onset to accept the risks. I don't think people realize that when it comes to unsecured debts, you can just stop paying. Unsecured means a credit card or personal loan. Debts connected to auto or real property are secured debts. You can walk away from those, but you'll stand to lose the asset. You can walk away from unsecured debts, and keep everything. In order for a credit card company to try to recover monies, they need to secure a judgement against you. In order to secure a judgement, they need satisfy the requirements in the Fair Credit Reporting Act before I judge will hear it.\n\nI'm not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. I am sharing my personal experience.\n\nI found myself a new college grad with over 50k in credit card debts across multiple cards. At the time, my focus was on doing whatever I needed to do to finish school. This includes all credit spending, charges and cash advances. I used them to subsidize my cost of living over 6 years. I had a modest first job as a new graduate. I I rented but had roommates. The 100k student loans activated and were now due. Something had to give so I decided to walk away from the cards.\n\nThe immediate response was constant robo calls reminding me that I was past due sometimes until 10pm. I received mail daily that I was past due. I changed my mailing address to a PO Box and forwarded mail there. I started blocking numbers and turning my ringer off at night. After about 3-4 months I started to get 3rd party collections notices. I answered every single one of them in writing. I denied owing what they said I owed and replied with signature confirmation that they needed to provide me with a copy of the signed loan contract, calculation of all spending, my signed receipts of all spending, calculation of all interest payments, and their license to work as a collection agency in my state. Some would disappear after that. Others would send me incomplete information, so I could reiterate that I disputed the claim and needed complete information.\n\nNot a single collection agency provided all the information. I mean, how could they. It was a near impossible ask. Some would reply and say they were dropping the collection and returning it to the original creditor. I felt like I was starting to win.\n\nAll this occurred over a period of months. During that time, I got a new job and moved to a different state. In that state I established a new phone number and new PO Box. Every now and again I would get a collection call on my new number or new address, but it was minimal. I would again block the call or reply demanding they validate the claim. If I was feeling lazy, I wouldn't open the envelope, mark it RTS across the front (Return to Sender) and drop it back in the mailbox.\n\nAfter about a year, I would get charge off notifications. This means the credit card company is writing off the debt and is taking it as a loss. They would send me a tax document for it. The IRS had a process in which discharged debt income could be excluded from taxable income, but you had to fill out the right forms. Because of the huge student loans, I had a negative net wealth, so I qualified. I filled those out and never paid taxes on the discharged amounts.\n\nIn the second year, there was one collection agency that was particularly stubborn. They sent me some certified mail. A notification card sat in my PO Box and I never went to the counter to pick it up. They did that maybe 2-3 times and each it was not picked up and after a few days the post office automatically returned it to the sender. Pro tip: Never sign for unsolicited certified mail.\n\nAround year 3, I started pulling my free credit reports and would do so every year thereafter. I disputed any/all negative marks with the credit reporting agencies. For example, if Transunion removed something, I would send that report to the other two agencies and usually that would be enough for them to remove it on their reports as well. But it's a slow process with 2-3 months in between each response.\n\nAs time went by, I never went to court, nothing was garnished, nobody seized anything, no process servers came to my door, nobody called me at work, no police came to my door.  I always paid the student loan and rent, never missed a payment on either of those. Always filed and paid my taxes. After six years, I was satisfied that the statute of limitations for collecting on unsecured debts had sunset (varies by state). I went to my brick and mortar that I had been banking with the whole time (debit card only) and got a credit card with a $500 limit and started to build up a positive history. Two years later I bought a house with a traditional mortgage.\n\nNote: That the credit reports were questioned by new employers from time to time. I said the debts were related to medical bills and medical condition. That stops them from questioning further as medical is protected and I never lost a job offer due to bad credit.\nnesowat: Disgusting lack of ethics.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: If an online friend frequently apologizes for slow replies over text, what does this imply?\n[deleted]\nPonytail77: I think it implies that the apology really isn't that sincere.  If you are truly sorry you try not to repeat it again.   \n\nThis friend is aware she's ignored your texts and so is trying to be polite by opening her reply repeatedly with a \"I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but...\"  \n\nIt basically shows they're busy and/or have other priorities.\n[deleted]: What she wrote was, \"Hey! Sorry for not answering for a long time - I was on vacation outside the city and there was no connection.\" She was honest about it because I saw from her stories, though when she replied it was like nine days past the New Year and I texted her on NYE. With that being said, my texts have always been very long so whether or not she was sincere it probably didn't matter that much. There's been a general trend of her replying once every week. But I've also noticed that when I wrote something that she didn't felt comfortable answering, for example I asked her if she liked to watch any Halloween movies over Halloween, then she took a longer time to reply and then came back at the end of November and apologized for being very busy (but only after I accidentally liked one of her IG photos which probably sent a notification to her phone). It's true that she was busy with something but no one could have probably been that busy that they would take a long time to reply to a text.\n\nBtw I also confronted her about this and it got really messy. But I get the sense that she wants to send meaningful replies rather than just \"one or two word texts,\" as she put it. So she may not have been sincere with the apology but she is probably sincere with the conversation. But also a part of me can't help but wonder if she feels pressured to apologize for slow replies after I nearly set an ultimatum on the conversation. I mean she's apologized in the past before for slow replies but I get the sense that she is probably going to apologize more often now out of any lingering pressure that she feels from me. I tried my best to move on from the confrontation but when something like that happens it's hard to forget. Now she's been busier with her life than before but yeah, I keep looking at it from my perspective and it's hard to come to terms with it. Like what if this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly..\nPonytail77: \"...this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly\"\n\nFrom what you've said, I think this is the most likely answer. Rather than \"read between the lines\" as they say, she just takes her time in responding -politely of course- hoping you'll get the hint.\n[deleted]: But couldn't that have also been because my texts were very long? Maybe if my texts had been shorter she wouldn't have apologized?\n\nHere's a brief timeline of the texts: She replied on October 23. I replied on November 6. She replied on November 28. I replied on December 24. She replied on December 28. I replied on December 31. She replied on January 9. She started off her replies on November 28 and January 9 with apologies. I have not replied since. I have backed off by a lot already. Is it not enough??\nPonytail77: I would take a break until I heard from her.  Or at least another month or so. \n\nSounds like you want more from this friendship then she is willing or able to give right now.  If she's interested, she can reach out to you at any time too.\n[deleted]: That's what I was thinking too. Not just because she told me that she's starting a new job but also because I am not completely sure if I should open up more in my texts with her. What draws me to her is that she is able to answer in detail, with compassion, and with great energy. It's not like she answers in one to three sentences. Often she answers in five to ten sentences. It's clear that she puts effort into her messages even if her priorities have changed or whatnot, and as a result, I overshare with her sometimes.\n\nBut I am still unsure how much I actually matter to her. Any confrontation that involved making excessive demands would turn people off. Whether or not it's long term remains to be seen. She said she's not mad, and she said she still likes the communication. I believe her, but people can also subtly pull themselves away while still being very polite. Not to mention she lives in a foreign country where the main language isn't English. Of course she has an incentive to communicate in English.\n\nIf I still matter to her in some way or the other, then she'll eventually reach out like she did before. I hate to say this but this is my way of testing her. I hope to take a break and not reply to her until May and continue to do nothing (not watching her stories, not liking any of her posts). If she doesn't reach out again asking how I am doing before then like she used to that should say something about how she actually feels.\nDiabetaBun: \u201cI hope to take a break\u201d I think, is a good start. Not as far as testing her but for your own self. Whether she is being too kind to upkeep her conversation with you, or simply too busy, or find it hard to respond due to language limitations, whatever else the \u201cpossible\u201d explanation could be, it\u2019s always important to refrain from being emotionally codependent with or on another. Coming from a neutral standpoint, you can still have meaningful conversations with her and very much have an \u2018active\u2019 relationship while not expecting too much from it. It is pretty apparent that, at this current time, she is unable to meet your needs. That is okay. There is so much that we can do when it involves another but we do have control on how we choose to handle the situation. I suggest being open to others who can click with you and meet your needs. It won\u2019t minimize the respect you have for your friend and it will increase the respect you have for yourself.\n\nIn regards to the frequent apologies, it\u2019s kind of hard to say. It can be due to insecurities, or fear to disappoint, or it can be because she doesn\u2019t like late responses herself, or, on top of fear to disappoint, she just simply has an active life and she does feel bad to have anyone waiting on her because she believes on being that great friend. If that makes sense\u2026\n[deleted]: There's something else that she mentions more frequently than apologies, and that's starting almost every single text with a \"Hey!\" This is something that she has started doing ever since last October, right around the time when my overbearing attitude went to extremes. Maybe she just happened to pick up something new, but I wonder if using hey consistently is a good thing? I know starting a text with a \"hey\" is great because it's informal, but she's using this on every single text now. Could she be using this to maintain distance?\nDiabetaBun: 1.) Out if curiosity, how long have the two of you known each other? \n\n2.) We\u2019re splitting hairs at this point.\n\n3.) Social Media has downside effects on how people perceive what is appropriate in aspects that involve communication and interpersonal relationships. For example, it becomes an expectation/demand to receive a response. To expound further, if the sender of the text sees that the receiver has indeed seen the text but have not yet responded, it rises the senders anxiety levels which in turn may cause them to over think or over analyze. \n\nI\u2019m not saying anything negative so I hope you don\u2019t take it as such but rather consider this information and do something proactive about your perception on things in regards to sending and receiving texts or what the messages contain. Don\u2019t stress too much about it.\n\nIt seems you really enjoy her company and value her insights and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to distance ourselves from something we see as value. At this point, if it were me in your shoes, I would apologize for the demands I have made because it sets up unrealistic expectations for them and puts some sort of stress on the relationship whether it is big or small. From what you have shared thus far, it\u2019s very minor. So it\u2019s nothing really to worry about. Then I would proceed to share what I value in this relationship and set expectations or guidelines that I know I can live by (nothing on them to do but for myself to do). When that gets done, I would take a step back and just not expect anything else other than what has already been given to be expected. The sooner we can come to accept things for what they are, the sooner we can address the \u201cissue\u201d at hand and move on from it. \n\nJust a precaution, this is advice given by someone who is big on communication and being quite frank and upfront. I don\u2019t like \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d and walking around the bushes. It\u2019s just something I face everyday with people and found it necessary for me to be proactive in eliminating bs. This stuff works for ME and may not necessarily work for everyone. We all have our own set of needs.\n", "prompt": "[deleted]: If an online friend frequently apologizes for slow replies over text, what does this imply?\n[deleted]\nPonytail77: I think it implies that the apology really isn't that sincere.  If you are truly sorry you try not to repeat it again.   \n\nThis friend is aware she's ignored your texts and so is trying to be polite by opening her reply repeatedly with a \"I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but...\"  \n\nIt basically shows they're busy and/or have other priorities.\n[deleted]: What she wrote was, \"Hey!

The frequent apologies for slow replies may come across as insincere, especially if the same pattern continues. It's possible that your online friend is genuinely busy, but it's also important to consider whether they're truly invested in the conversation. If they were, they would likely make more of an effort to respond in a timely manner.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the apology may be a way to soften the blow of their lack of response, rather than a genuine expression of regret.

It's been great, minus my lack of handy experience, but everyone has to start somewhere. \n\nWe had a lot of rain this week and as a result our ceiling sprung a [leek](http://imgur.com/nCSd0bq).  Today I decided to check it out before calling a professional.  The portion of the [roof](http://imgur.com/0Tc9gUd) that is leaking seems to be some sort of metal that is sealed (or is supposed to be).  It is on a dormer that was likely an addition at some point. The rest of the roof is shingled and looks to be in decent shape. \n\nThe problem appears to be the vents in the roof.  Here is:\n*[Vent 1](http://imgur.com/NaWBtS1)\n*[Vent 2](http://imgur.com/Vt7xqAH)\n\nIt is fairly apparent at this point where the water is coming into the house at. I picked away some of the material around Vent 1 and it looks something like this [underneath](http://imgur.com/RvdOKt0). \n\nIt seems that I need to scrape off as much of the weathered sealant as I can and replace the flashing around the vents.  Then reseal the entire dormer portion of the roof with a better product.  Am I right in this methodology or missing something?\n\nSomebody that has experienced this before: what products work best for sealing this type of roof? What about something like [this](http://flexsealproducts.com/shop/liquid/?gclid=CjwKEAjwpfC5BRCT1sKW2qzwqE0SJABkKFKR8vrBSPm1j268gQ3Ni2tXcIO6EmJD-F04Kx3Dj91bFhoC_vnw_wcB)?\nThe appearance in this location isn't very important, as it can't be seen from the ground.\n\nThanks a bunch!\nsomeonesdaddy: I laugh so hard at everyone in this thread that says call a roofer. I laugh even harder at the top comment that says call the previous homeowner and ask him to help pay for it. \n\nThese roof vents are known frequent culprits for leaking and it is no big deal. Clean the area up and apply a rubberized compound or tar. I have even used the rubberized aerosol spray before thus creating a rubber boot.\n\nI like the rubberized product called stop leak. It comes in a one gallon paint can and you apply/shape it with a putty knife. For a complex shape I will wear rubber gloves and mold it by hand. \n\nYou are a homeowner now and welcome to the big leagues.  You can't call someone everytime your toilet is clogged anymore. Go forth and be the master of your castle.\n\nYour average contractor will scare you into turning a small job into a big one. This is especially true if they think the homeowner is not very mechanically savvy. \nAbsolutelyPink: While I agree that a roofing contractor can scare you into turning a small job into a big one, this roof is in bad shape and flat or semi-flat roofing jobs are best left to a professional.  Spraying rubber isn't going to fix this one. \n\nI have roofing experience, but there are specialty products meant for flat roofs that aren't as simply as spraying rubber on the roof. It need to be redone and not just around the vents.\n\nMake sure you call a couple companies for estimates and make sure they specialize in flat roofs.  You can check with mobile home sellers in your area for referrals as well.\n\nYou will also need to fix that drywall.  Odds are, the insulation (if any) above that is wet as well.  The drywall will need replacing at a minimum.  If it's still wet, poke a couple holes in it to let the water drain.\n\nAs a temporary measure, tarp your roof until you get it repaired.\nsomeonesdaddy: I agree with you and your advice is sound. There have been times in my life when I could not afford the proper solution or the best one.\n\nI have made due with patching stuff like this in the past. In Florida where I live the roofing laws are funny because of hurricanes. If anything more than 25% of the roof is damaged you are required to get a whole new roof. \n\nI have seen plenty of good roofs complete torn off because a small section needed repair. These days homeowners are looking for a roofer  that is not going to pull a permit thus requiring inspection. \nAbsolutelyPink: I agree.  I've been in the position where I couldn't afford to have things done properly and made due with what I could afford.  It sucks.  Unfortunately, a roof is not where you want to pinch pennies. Heck, in Nevada we get winds enough to rip off a roof. This roof will leak and leak again until it's redone.  Let's just hope there hasn't been enough damage already, to cause the ceiling or roof to cave in though mold might already be of issue.\nBrotisBoughtAHouse: Thanks for the feedback.  I think I might be able to handle the flashing parts, but as others have pointed out, there are likely greater underlying problems that I don't want to risk.  It's looking like stop leak is the way to go for now for an immediate solution.  Over the next week I plan to get a slew of estimates on a more thorough fix.

{"full_text": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for. Rather, I have once heard of a study citing that skipping breakfast can trigger an insulin response which would immediately store any and all calories ingested throughout the day into fat. \n\n\nDoes this have any credibility behind it? Does skipping breakfast help your weight loss personally? \nscreepatrol: Any studies that have weird findings about skipping meals or eating 8 meals a day or whatever are either 1) paid for their results by the industry or 2) terribly controlled. \n\nEat once a day. Eat 8 times a day. Eat only during a certain period or snack all day. Your body is great at partitioning calories and the effects of when you eat that food are somewhere between negligible and nonexistent. \n\nToo often people look at what professional bodybuilders/weightlifters/strongmen do and think that's how you succeed. Those guys are at the top level and the only thing left is to focus on the last 1%. The other 99% is controlling your calories/macros and progressive overload in training. \n\nDon't overthink this. \nSpicyThingy: Its not about the calories. Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000% which leads to better fat burning and better muscle growth. That doesnt have to do with sponsorships, it is just measureing. \nNihilii: &gt; increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over\n\nSo is it up to, or is it over? Or does \"up to over 1000%\" mean anywhere between 0 and infinity? I mean that would surely be correct, but not very useful.\n\nAnd do you have any source for those revelations?\nSpicyThingy: Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass. \nNihilii: &gt;Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass.\n\nWell, it's not my first language either, and \"up to and over\" is a classic marketing spiel (that crops up not just in english), which is why I'm giving you attitude for doing it. \n\nBut to the point - your own source, a single study mind you, so not a very strong ground to declare something as a hard fact, has found a 1000% increase in mean GH level after **5 days of fasting**. They were also **injecting the subjects with Growth-Hormone Releasing Hormone**. Based on that you say this:\n\n&gt;Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\nSo even forgetting that slip of the tongue there, you are still clearly suggesting that just intermittent fasting can give you a tenfold GH increase. This is naive at best, and purposefully misleading at worst. How can you consider that study in any way comparable to a person doing something like a typical 16/8 intermittent fasting schedule? \n\nSeriously. You either haven't read the paper you linked or you're sensationalizing this on purpose. I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nYou don't get to pull the asshole card when you're lying to people.\nthoughtihadanacct: While the 1000% claim by u/SpicyThingy may be an exaggeration (deliberate or not I can\u2019t say), it is also unfair of you to entirely discredit the study he cited based on the reasons you have given.\n\nIn figures 2 and 3 and table 1 of the study, it clearly shows that GH concentration increases from fasting even on day 1. Yes the effect on day 1 may be lower than on day 5, and again the 1000% claim may have been misleading. However you seem to be implying that the benefits of fasting with regard to HGH only happen after 5 days, and you claim that the study in no way has bearing on 16:8 fasting. The fact that there is some (albeit lower) effect on day 1 of fasting suggests that 16/8 fasting may have some benefits (albeit lower than say 5 day fasting).\n\nYou boldly state that the reserchers injected the subjects with GHRH, in an attempt to discredit the study. This was dishonest. While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed. And from fig 2 the effects of the injection do not last more than about 3 hours. The injections were done to investigate the effect of fasting on GHRH sensitivity. (True the study could have been \u201cbetter\u201d by focusing on only one thing at a time, but it stands that the injections don\u2019t negate the findings regarding GH release.)\n\nIn the end what Im saying is that it\u2019s not binary - ie it\u2019s not \u201cfasting results in 1000% increase in GH\u201d vs \u201cbullshit the study is meaningless/useless\u201d. What I\u2019m arguing is that fasting does increase GH levels to some extent. More (longer) fasting results in more increase. The exact magnitude of increase is variable and probably differs from person to person.\nNihilii: I never said the study is meaningless. I said what the guy said was misleading and even the single study he picked to support his position does not do so. You can't just sling around some numbers from a study without looking at the context. This was an extremely sloppy attempt at backing one's claims with science.\n\n&gt;While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed.\n\nWell, that's my bad then. It was not clear to me from the study design that the post-GHRH injection measurements were not included in the later analysis and I can't honestly say I read the thing front-to-back since it was pretty late that night. In-depth analysis of this study was not my point though, as I said.\nthoughtihadanacct: \u201cthe single study he picked to support his position does not do so.\u201d\n\nDepends what (you think) his position is. If his position is literally that fasting for 16 hours a day increases GH levels by 1000% in every human being, then yes the study does not support it. However if we are a bit more generous and assume his position is that fasting \u201csignificantly\u201d increases GH level in general, then I believe the study does support that position to some extent.\n", "prompt": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for.

The way it hijacks your brain is just evil.\n\nIs it possible that you may be able to get into some sort of medication maintenance program? I know that those programs have pretty strict rules, but I've known some people who were able to get off of the heroin by taking suboxone or methadone for a while and then, eventually, taper off.\n\nSome people need to be on it long-term, but in some cases that can be a lot better than having to go out and think about how to score more heroin. Firstly, it eliminates the illegality of possession and some of the stuff people might do in order to score. Secondly, there's a LOT of cut heroin out there these days. There's no telling what might be in the stuff and with the crap that some people are cutting it with one shot, sniff, or smoke could mean instant death. Fentanyl and carfentanyl are outright instant killers compared to heroin on its own.\n\nWhatever path you choose I wish you the best of luck.\nJPSYCHC: I am on suboxone and in an IOP\n\nMy dope had fent in it, I know because I tested positive for it regularly. But believe it or not in my state, I considered that a good thing. It made it better\n\nThe risk though, regardless of tolerance, is if it isn't mixed well and you get a hot spot. Then even Kurt Cobain would be a dead man. \ngrimgrau: Oh, I completely understand if the dope is stronger than usual even if it's fent, I mean, so long as it isn't the last time you use it of course if you get what I mean. If you use drugs and you get more bang for your buck you're probably going to see that as a bonus no matter which drug it is.\n\nI used to have a huge polysubstance addiction/abuse problem in my mid to late 20's for about 4 years, but my main choice of drug was anything psychedelic. I wasn't addicted to one drug. I was addicted to being altered, preferably on psychedelics. I tripped on so many things so often that to this day I still see motion trails any time something moves and haloes around lights. Fortunately that's it and it doesn't negatively interfere with my life, but when I found a hookup for LSD I ended up doing so much so often I wound up in the emergency room a few times having no fucking clue how I got there. I inherited some $20,000'ish in stocks and I blew almost all of it on LSD, weed, and electronics. Psychedelics aren't even supposed to be addictive. No physical addiction or withdrawal, but I got to the point where I couldn't make it through a week without tripping on something or otherwise getting high. Never messed with meth, cocaine/crack, or opiates though.\n\nI ended up in treatment a few times because of that. That's when I met people who had similar problems or were hooked on other things like heroin. So I know how tough it is. If my addiction had a physical dependence component where I'd go into physical withdrawal and felt like I was dying without getting high man, I don't even know what would have happened to me. It was bad enough that my mind and my emotions SCREAMED for me to need to be under the influence to get through a week or even a few days. SO glad that's in my past now.\n\nIt also doesn't help that it turns out that I also have bipolar disorder, but I've been stable on medications for a very long time now and have been slowly getting my life back in order. Fortunately for me I've been heading down a very good path for a long time, but I understand what it's like to be addicted and to be in treatment and everything. I've met some cool people along the way and hadn't seen them for years only to find out that they're no longer here.\n\nApart from finding medications that keep me 100% stable and fine, exercise has helped me through BIG TIME and ever since I've been regularly exercising in some way, at the very least always doing some sort of cardio.\n\nIf you ever have any questions about bodyweight fitness or just need to talk feel free to hit me up. I've been doing bodyweight exercise for 2 and 1/2 years now and I'm about to turn 35. I'm getting older and I'm at the point where I can't even imagine partying anymore. I need my sleep! I'm happy to answer any of your questions about this stuff or to just read whatever you have to say. If you don't feel comfortable replying in a comment you can send me a private message.\n\nIf there's anything that I can do to help no matter how small it is I feel like in some way I've been through some of the same shit and I'll respond to you even if it takes me a few days (I'm not always online.)\n\nTake care!\n", "prompt": "SweelFor: What is your mid/long term plan for BWF training?\nHi everyone\n\nFor these past few days I have been thinking about how I would like to structure my training in the mid/long term.

That is the whole point of a functional vaccine and personal choice. The only reason someone needs is \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d. A simple \u201cno\u201d would suffice. Their bodily autonomy is not your concern. You taking the vaccine doesn\u2019t protect anyone but yourself. Therefore, they only hurt themselves.\n\nMy problem isn\u2019t the vaccine or the unvaccinated. My problem is the government thinking it\u2019s their job to enforce and threaten a mandate and loss of employment. Taking away a persons job is akin to killing them. It is disgustingly immoral and unethical.

You\u2019re wrong.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; The people that can\u2019t get vaccinated can always continue wearing masks and distancing. \n\nYou said the vaccine only protects the person who gets it. That\u2019s patently false. And the vaccine is IMMENSELY more effective than the *other* person wearing a mask. Remember the primary function of masks is to stop sick people from spreading it. This unvaccinated maskless person is putting anyone he comes in contact with in danger if that person can\u2019t get vaccinated.

To which other scientists have greatly agreed. Let\u2019s pretend you have no degree but have lots of common sense. If you are vaccinated but no animals are, and they can still catch it.. will it go away? Or will it continue to mutate? Let\u2019s remember the original cause of covid and the original theory that it evolved in bats to begin with.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; Unvaccinated can\u2019t have breakthrough infections\n\n\u2026I never said they did. You are quite lost. Or your reading comprehension is subpar. It should be obvious to any functionally literate person that I was comparing breakthrough infections in vaccinated people to infections rates among unvaccinated. \u201cBreakthrough infection\u201d automatically only means vaccinated people. \n\n&gt; You don\u2019t understand the phrases you are using.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I lost you here. You said \u201cWhile vaccinated you can still catch and spread the virus at seemingly the exact same rates.\u201d That is patently false. Breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are MUCH lower than regular infections in unvaccinated people. \n\n&gt; Fauci did an interview where he explicitly stated that every person alive could be vaccinated and the virus would not go away because of animal transmissibility. \n\n1. Cite that. \n\n2. Explain how that affects herd immunity. \n\n3. Square that with his explicit recommendation (which I cited) that says everyone should get vaccinated and social distance in order to stop new variants.\nNoRecommendation8689: If a vaccinated person catches covid and an unvaccinated person catches covid they will transmit the virus to other people at exactly the same rates. The difference is that the vaccinated person won't know that they are contagious, while the unvaccinated person will at least have some indication that they are sick. There has been almost no asymptomatic transmission of covid. What there have been is very mild symptom transmission or an even more rare cases pre-symptomatic transmission. People who never become symptomatic at all do not transmit the disease, unless they're vaccinated.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; If a vaccinated person catches covid and an unvaccinated person catches covid they will transmit the virus to other people at exactly the same rates.\n\nBut that unvaccinated person is SIX times more likely to catch it in the first place. \n\n&gt; while the unvaccinated person will at least have some indication that they are sick. \n\nNot true. Most covid is *spread* before the victim shows any symptoms. Even if they ultimately die. That\u2019s how insidious this virus is. We\u2019ve known this for over a year. Where have you been?\n\n&gt; There has been almost no asymptomatic transmission of covid. \n\nThat is patently false. \n\n&gt; People who never become symptomatic at all do not transmit the disease,\n\n[Utterly false.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20people%20who,designed%20to%20prevent%20spread.)\n\n* \u201cIn fact, people who are infected may be more likely to spread the illness if they are asymptomatic.\u201d\nNoRecommendation8689: The most extensive study on this to date showed a 0.3 asymptomatic transmission rate, and that was amongst people known to have covid and known to where the covid came from. You are just absolutely wrong and you haven't bothered to read anything that the CDC just hasn't spoon-fed directly into your mouth.\nphilly_steak_cheese: Show me your source. You have yet to do that with any of your spamming. I\u2019ve given you half a dozen sources and you just plug your ears and go \u201clalalalala.\u201d\n\n1. I suspect 0.3 asymptomatic transmission refers to people who NEVER got symptoms. Most asymptotic transmission was PRE symptom. So they wouldn\u2019t be in that group since they were ultimately NOT asymptomatic. \n\n2. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to really track asymptomatic spread because, shockingly, asymptomatic people don\u2019t tend to get tested and traced.\nNoRecommendation8689: And you post summaries from CBS news, the organization that literally photoshopped a handgun out of the frame to pretend like the police that shot the perpetrator wasn't justified.

{"full_text": "jackgary118: In Defence of Strong Emergentist Panpsychism\n\nucanttaketheskyfrome: This article provides two reasons to reject physicalism - the theory that we can explain consciousness with only physical entities. First, the \"transparent conceivability\" argument: because we can conceive of a consciousness-less world where physicalism is true, physicalism does not entail consciousness. Second, the knowledge argument: a person with all the data about an experience still \"learns\" something when they actually experience it. These two arguments are supposed to be compelling reasons to reject physicalism. Are they?\n\nThe first argument equates conceivable with possible, but the fact that zombies are conceivable does not mean that they are possible. Even at my most charitable, I do not understand why \"we can imagine a conscious-less world of physicalism\" is any sort of adequate refutation. The fact that we lack the knowledge to find a contradiction between physicalism and the zombie thesis does not mean there isn't one; we should be more reluctant to discard physicalism. To a physicalist, a zombie is nonsensical. It would be like postulating if the concept of \"health\" evaporates if we compare two identical people, and one of them are missing an organ. \"Consciousness\" could simply be an emergent property of the physical interaction of neurons. This does not demand any mental state.\n\nThe second argument is problematic because I don't think Mary \"learns\" something phenomenal. It sounds like she is just seeing new ways to represent facts she already knows. The \"knowledge\" was acquired prior; her experience with red outside the black-and-white-room is not new. We could test this by showing her something non-red, and asking her to identify the content based on what she has learned about red from inside the room. Alternatively, if she couldn't learn the knowledge from in the room, a better way to resolve this problem is to ask whether this is a kind of knowledge that can't be learned from within the room but still physical. Why do we assume this kind of knowledge isn't simply physical knowledge? This rests on how you define \"physicality\". This is just a word game; I can make it so that physicalism can totally account for consciousness by broadening or narrowing the definition to include Mary's knowledge.\n\nedit: word choice, see infra\ndnew: &gt; The fact that zombies are conceivable \n\nI've never seen an argument supporting that p-zombies are conceivable, either. I've just heard people assert that p-zombies are conceivable, without any evidence that they're not logically inconsistent. (And some have given good arguments as to why they're not logically consistent.) And, as you say, even if it were logically consistent, that says nothing about reality.  \"There might be a different universe somewhere in which X happens, therefore X happens.\"\n\nI mean, they're named \"zombies\" for a reason, right?  \"Fred is not alive. He is in every way measurable to science as though he were alive, and no doctor would be able to tell he's not alive, but *really* he doesn't have the essence of life that makes him alive. He just acts that way.\"  If anyone *today* argued that such a thing made sense, we'd scoff.\n\n&gt; The second argument is problematic \n\nThe second argument is also problematic because Mary is asserted to learn something new when she sees red, but that begs the question. The question is \"does Mary learn something new?\" To assert \"Well, yes, obviously\" doesn't actually argue the point.  I assert that Mary's knowledge is so inconceivably vast, so unintuitively complete, that one's intuition about whether or not she learns something is impossible to deduce without carrying out the experiment.\nFlexography: &gt; I've never seen an argument supporting that p-zombies are conceivable, either\n\nIt's not a claim which requires an argument.  If I say \"I can conceive of a blue tennis ball\", what argument could I possibly provide for that?  Sure, I could give some examples of ways that it's logically consistent, but if you are determined to reject my assertion, then I can never satisfy you, because there are an infinite number of considerations I would need to respond to.\nIf, on the other hand, you think that zombies are *not* conceivable, it's up to *you* to demonstrate why.  \n\n&gt;  I assert that Mary's knowledge is so inconceivably vast, so unintuitively complete, that one's intuition about whether or not she learns something is impossible to deduce without carrying out the experiment\n\nA Physicalist *cannot* take this line of argument.  If it is impossible to determine if Mary learned something new, then Physicalism is false.  If Physicalism is true, then there are only physical facts; thus, Mary--who has all of the physical facts--cannot learn something new.  If it is \"impossible to deduce\" whether or not Mary learns something new, Physicalism is false. \nlurkingowl: &gt; If, on the other hand, you think that zombies are not conceivable, it's up to you to demonstrate why.\n\nBecause it contradicts physicalism?\n\nIf your entire knock-out punch against physicalism is just a burden of proof argument, it's not really a knock-out punch or even good logic, it's just rhetoric.\n\nIf it's *not* a burden of proof argument, then you need to actually prove your claims.\nFlexography: The conceivability of zombies does not contradict Physicalism.  A Physicalist can accept that zombies are conceivable, and many do.  \n\nIn any case, it would be sort of suspect to deny that epistemological claim *just because* it went against a prior commitment you had.  That would be really dishonest.  Whether or not something is conceivable is just a claim about what a person can conceive of.  It doesn't mean anything other than *I can conceive of this thing*.  If you're going to say \"*Physicalism is true, therefore it's got to be impossible that zombies are conceivable*\", you're being dishonest because you are not accurately reporting whether or not zombies are conceivable.  You'd be saying \"well, on the version of Physicalism I subscribe to, zombies can't be conceivable, therefore they aren't conceivable\", then that would be putting the cart before the horse--you'd be presupposing a conclusion without argument, and dismissing contrary arguments by just asserting that conclusion, which isn't really how philosophy is done.  \nlurkingowl: You completely skipped my point:\n\nIf all you have is a burden of proof argument, *you haven't proven anything.*\n\nI'll stand by my belief (which you and anyone else who puts forward the conceivability argument agrees with) that the conceivability of zombies contradicts physicalism separately if you like.\nFlexography: Oh, well I addressed that in my first comment, which you were replying to (and sort of in my reply as well....).  Claims about conceivability are just claims about what you can conceive.  They have to do with whether ideas are logically consistent, whether certain things are contradictory, and so on.  If I say \"I can conceive of X\" there is literally no argument I could possibly provide that would convince you that X is actually conceivable.  I would have to run through infinitely-many considerations in order to show that X is consistent.  If you think that X is not internally consistent--that is, that I cannot conceive of X--then it is up to you to show why.  All you need to do is show one contradiction that is internal to X.  \n\nIf something is inconceivable, there's a reason why--that is, if something is inconceivable, then there is something about that thing which *makes it inconceivable*.  The burden of proof is on you to show that it is inconceivable precisely because there is no way to prove that *anything* is conceivable.  How could I possibly prove the a blue tennis ball is conceivable?  If you were determined to reject blue tennis balls, I could never satisfy you, because I cannot possibly go through the infinite number of considerations I would have to respond to.  If, however, you think that blue tennis balls are *not* conceivable, you need to give one reason why.  For example \"tennis balls have felt, but it is logically impossible for felt to be blue, therefore you cannot conceive of a blue tennis ball\" or something like that.  If you can't provide a reason *why* the thing is inconceivable.... well then it's conceivable. \n\nAnd, again, the conceivability of zombies does not contradict Physicalism.  Physicalism is a claim about the world.  It is the claim that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff.  That is the Physicalist thesis.  The conceivability of zombies is not a claim about the world; it is a claim about what we can conceive of.  These things do not contradict each other in any way. \nlurkingowl: You're still not addressing the fact that all you're presenting (the way you're arguing this) is a burden of proof argument against physicalism.  If you're going to bring up conceivability, and try to use it as a point in an argument, you can't turn around in the middle and claim I'm failing a point you've presented no evidence for.  It's perfectly fine to say \"I believe there's a contradiction in there, but we don't understand the terms and processes well enough for me to spell it out.\"\n\n(Physicalism contradicts conceivability in a separate reply.)\nFlexography: We're not even talking about Physicalism at the moment.  We're talking about about what it takes for something to be conceivable.  For any conceivability argument, the burden of proof is *always* on the person who says that it is inconceivable.  If something is inconceivable, then it can be demonstrated that it is inconceivable.  However, it can NEVER be demonstrated that ANYTHING is conceivable. \n\nI've literally said multiple times there there is ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF any person could EVER provide that any X is conceivable such that you could convince someone that X is conceivable.  That's a basic logical fact about consistency.  \n\nInconsistency, on the other hand, does not require an infinite number of proofs.  It requires one--one example of a contradiction.  This is, again, a basic logical fact about inconsistency.  \n\nThe burden of proof is absolutely completely entirely 100% on the person who says that zombies are inconceivable.  \nlurkingowl: No, the burden of proof *in any argument* is 100% on the person making a positive claim.  If I'm not trying to use conceivability as part of an argument to draw a conclusion, I have absolutely no burden of proof.  I can happily continue on being a physicalist until someone figures out a way to make show that zombies are conceivable (or puts forward some other argument.)  The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\nFlexography: Here's an argument:\n\nP1) I can conceive of blue tennis balls\n\nP2) If I can conceive of blue tennis balls, then  blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nC1) Therefore blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\n\nI can offer absolutely no support for (P1) that would convince a skeptic that I can actually conceive of a blue tennis ball.  If you think that there is a burden of proof on me to somehow prove \"I can conceive of a blue tennis ball\" without having any sort of criticism of that claim to respond to, then this argument cannot go through, and we cannot conclude that blue tennis balls are logically consistent.  We can't even conclude that (P1)--that I can conceive of them--is true, since we can't give an argument for it.  But surely that's not right.  This argument is obviously valid, and we want to say that it's sound too.  We know that blue tennis balls are conceivable.  And if someone comes up to you tomorrow and says \"You totally can't conceive of blue tennis balls\", they better have a damn good reason for their assertion.  The burden of proof is on *them*.  *They* have to give a reason why we can't conceive of blue tennis balls.  We certainly think we are conceiving of them.  So if we are mistaken, they need to show why.  \n\n&gt; The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\n\nThis is simply untrue.  Physicalism is by definition a specific claim.  It is the claim that that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff. This is not controversial.  This is the definition of Physicalism. \nlurkingowl: &gt;&gt;The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\n\n&gt;This is simply untrue.

It is the claim that that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff. This is not controversial. This is the definition of Physicalism.\n\nYes, Physicalism is a specific claim.  I was saying that the physicalist doesn't need to present a detailed proof that zombies aren't conceivable.  The physicalist *isn't using it as the premise of an argument.*  They can happily say that inconceivability is a conclusion from their premises (plus the conceivability-&gt;metaphysical possibility claim.)  No part of their chain of reasoning depends on it.\n\nChalmers *is* using conceivability as the premise of an argument.  If the premise is false, the whole argument is invalid.\nFlexography: Here's an argument:\n\nP1) I can conceive of blue tennis balls\n\nP2) If I can conceive of blue tennis balls, then blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nC1) Therefore blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nI can offer absolutely no support for (P1) that would convince a skeptic that I can actually conceive of a blue tennis ball.

They have to give a reason why we can't conceive of blue tennis balls. We certainly think we are conceiving of them. So if we are mistaken, they need to show why.  \n\nImagine if this person then said \"I don't need to give a reason why blue tennis balls are inconceivable.  The burden of proof is on you to prove that you can conceive of a blue tennis ball.  And until you do that, I don't have to put forth any argument\".  If that happened, you would not take this person seriously.  You know that it is not your job to prove that blue tennis balls are conceivable if you haven't been given any reason to think otherwise.  This person will *never* accept that blue tennis balls are conceivable, because it is literally impossible for you to prove that they are conceivable, since that would require that you respond to an infinite number of potential criticisms.

(I then got a second opinion and that person wanted to put my on anti depressants immediately.)  The counselor told me that this condition is not my fault, and that I should not be ashamed of it.  I find that this has been a really helpful way to think about it.

{"full_text": "aschulz90: An attempt at DIY mold removal leads to a stinkier house..uh oh?\nI have an old (\\~100 yr old) house with rubble foundation (\\~1600 sq feet, mostly two story) located in new england.\n\nThe first floor had a hardly noticeable mildew-y smell that came from the basement. The basement especially had this smell and I'm still confident for reasons to be shared below that the smell originates from the basement. There is a dehumidifier running 24/7 in the basement and usually registers in the 30%s, pretty good!.\n\nIn this basement was a giant, moldy, plywood, DIY shelf / wall. Personally I think it was pretty thoughtless of the previous owner to put such a good food source for mold down in the basement. I demolished and threw into a rented dumpter the entirety of that plywood/2x4 two days ago (Saturday). Then yesterday (Sunday) in a full tyveck suit and mold mask I sprayed a \\~20% bleach / water solution around where the plywood had been sitting and scrubbed / swept alot of the mess into a garabage bag and threw that into the dumpster as well. I did this with the attached garage door open and a fan running in the basement. After my DIY remediation in the evening I closed the first floor windows and the garage door and let the fan run overnight to help dry out the basement.\n\nWe awoke this morning and now the house has a crazy strong musky smell. Luckily I suspect the bedroom must have been well sealed off as there was quiet a difference walking out into the hallway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow our first floor really stinks though and I'm worried about the following:\n\n1. I've spread mold to everywhere and now the whole sill of the house, joists, flooring, etc will get moldy (though I think that's unlikely...hopefully?).\n2. That there is ***another*** source of mold which I can't find that I disrupted with the fan and blew around the house (even crawled around the crawl space mentioned below looking for other mold with a flashlight) .\n\nAny thoughts or tips would be appreciated. \n\nBasement background:  most of the basement is walking height with poured concrete floor and relatively well pointed walls, not too bad. Never gets too wet down there though can get humid. The kitchen of the house however sits on a rubble foundation with dirt floor but a vapor barrier sits above the dirt floor. The sealing between the stone and plastic is far from perfect. Since I can't see it I'm worried about what's going on below the vapor barrier.\n\nThanks for any help after reading this long post.\nvelcrobungee: I just posted on a similar problem.\n\nI did two things.\n\n1. Spray the basement walls/floors/ceilings with Concrobium\n2. I bought an ozone generator (dangerous to use, be very careful).\n\nThe concrobium is like borax, it goes on wet but when it dries it forms crystals that explode the mold spores. It lasts but can be rubbed off the surface. It also re-forms crystals if the basement gets humid again. (you still have to fix the underlying problem, the damp basement needs to be vented.\n\nI've used that ozone generator for many other things including my cars,, pet odors,, etc\n\nThis is the one I purchased, it's supposed to be a good one.

Then clean up the mold.\nhasoneconleche: Additional advice for the concrobium:  YOU MUST HAVE NEGATIVE AIR PRESSURE AND WEAR A FULL FACE RESPIRATOR WITH A PURPLE/GRAY ( ORGANIC VAPOR). FILTER.

{"full_text": "Kavec: What if PETA was wrong and its consequences.\nI am talking about the typical discussion: why People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) do not want people to harm animals but they are OK with eating plants.\n\nThe answers about that are akin to \"duh! killing a plant is not the same thing as killing an animal!\", but they kind of avoid the interesting points:\nhttp://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/why-is-it-ok-to-eat-plants-and-not-animals/\n\nNevertheless this article hits the nail on the head when it enunciates the subject of the discussion:\n\n&gt; But what if we don\u2019t know enough about plants? It\u2019s easy to understand why this discussion could lead someone who enjoys eating meat and other animal products to conclude that we might as well eat animals, since not eating them could lead us down a ridiculous slippery slope where we might not be able to eat anything. Such a conclusion, unfortunately amounts to nothing more than an excuse to justify our consumption of animals. \n\nMy guess on the matter is a little bit difficult for me to explain but I'll do my best (specially not being English my mothertongue, not at all):\n\nLots of people are able to stare at a dead fish and feel nothing, but when they see a dead dog and they feel realy bad. I think this happens because for an average human it is easier to relate to a mammal than to a fish, both being ~~human~~ living beings. What if we go farther away from the mammals. What if we talk about plants: we feel a little bit bad if a big tree is cut down, because some of us can relate to that as we are both of us human beings. But I think most of us agree that this reaction is, in average, a lot less stressful than someone cutting a dog in front of us.\n\nWe can observe in life that dying is most likely an stressful experience for all living beings, in some way or another. Keeping that in mind, let's go even farther: bacteria, body cells, etc. One might presume that they fight against death as furiously as a person who is drowning and is fighting for some air. Does it mean that antibiotics are unethical?\n\nFor me the solution to this puzzle is to change the formulation of \"Ethical Treatment\" (as in PETA) which is usually understood as \"avoiding pain\" to other living beings. IMO, what we really want to avoid is **our own pain**. Thus if you allow other humans to get hurt, you feel you will be likely to get hurt as well. Same thing goes with animals: if you allow people to hurt animals which we relate to, it is easy that these people get insensible also to human suffering. With plants this risk is very little, this is why PETA would not care about people eating vegies.\n\nDoes it make sense? Any ideas on the matter?\n\n---\n\n**Edit**: I agree with the general argument that \"plants have no nervous system\", but I still would not be sure that this means that they have no feelings. I would like to add some relevant information to this discussion:\n\nVery relevant: TED Talk, The roots of plant intelligence http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/stefano_mancuso_the_roots_of_plant_intelligence.html\n\nAskscience: Are bugs able to feel pain? http://ww.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ib81m/are_bugs_able_to_feel_pain/\n\n**Edit2**: I am not saying that it is OK to be cruel to animals. Not in the least. I am just wondering if the typical moral arguments that support it are flawed, and discussing some alternatives.\n\nIn the ancient times, people would not consider a tree as a living being. Now we do. Some centuries ago almost no one would believe that animals had feelings. Now we do. Our understanding and perception about the matter varies over the time.\nbobbaphet: The consequences would be irrelevant, even if plants had feelings. The reason why is because it would be completely unreasonable to not eat plants. The typical moral argument is not flawed even if plants did have feeling because the only other alternative would be to starve yourself to death, *which is completely and totally unreasonable*. Only an insane person would think otherwise. Whether or not plants have feelings is irrelevant.\njohnbentley: &gt; even if plants did have feeling because the only other alternative would be to starve yourself to death, which is completely and totally unreasonable.\n\nWhat if the plants where not only conscious but self conscious?\nbobbaphet: So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\njohnbentley: Yes.\n\nIf you develop a condition where you need a heat transplant, and none are available from the organ donor list, it would be immoral to kill another (adult) human so that you might live. The wrongness doesn't lie in species membership, it lies in that other (adult) humans are self conscious.\nbobbaphet: &gt;Yes.\n\nwhich is completely and totally unreasonable. Only an insane person would think otherwise.\n\njohnbentley: But you don't address the heart transplant case.\nbobbaphet: Yes, I usually don't address irrelevant things.\njohnbentley: Why is it not relevant?\nbobbaphet: Because regardless of what is true, not eating plants is not an option, unless you are insane and suicidal...\njohnbentley: That is possibly the most intellectually dishonest response I've come across.\nbobbaphet: \"Yes you should not eat plants if they are conscious\", is what the most intellectually dishonest response is. That is totally ludicrous!\njohnbentley: I never made that claim, and that you are back there demonstrates your intellectual dishonesty.\nbobbaphet: Yes you did. \n\nI said: \"So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\" \n\nYour response was: \"Yes\". \n\nYou are the one being intellectually dishonest here. Or perhaps you just forgot you said that? \n\n\n\njohnbentley: I forgot nothing. Your recent reference \"if they are conscious\", not \"if they were self conscious\".\n\n\n\n\nbobbaphet: So if they are conscious OR self conscious, we should starve ourselves to death?...Nonsense either way.\njohnbentley: That this is not my view is further evidence of your intellectual laziness.\nbobbaphet: If that is the case, then you should have not said \"Yes\" to the question...\njohnbentley: I answered \"Yes\" to\n\n&gt; So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\n\nI didn't answer yes to \n\n&gt; if they are conscious OR self conscious, we should starve ourselves to death?\n\nI'd like to know what criteria you have for judging it morally permissible to take or save a life. If it species membership then we have nothing left to discuss.\nbobbaphet: &gt;I answered \"Yes\" to So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\n\nExactly, which is completely and totally ridiculous...\n.\njohnbentley: It may well be ridiculous but the intellectually honest course is to say why. One way to say why is to show why some other criteria is the right, and vastly superior, one.\nbobbaphet: &gt;It may well be ridiculous but the intellectually honest course is to say why.\n\nBecause you are advocating **committing suicide**..**.Which is insane**... I thought that part was obvious...but I guess not... Get back to me when you want to have a **reasonable** discussion...\njohnbentley: But I addressed the argument from committing suicide (in the sense of letting yourself die rather than kill others) in the heart transplant case. You ignored it. You seem to be a bigot, having entrenched ideas that you shy away from examining.\nbobbaphet: I ignored it because it's irrelevant because committing suicide is literally insane... Like I said, I am only interested in reasonable discussions. You are simply being unreasonable. \njohnbentley: So you think a healthy person should be killed so their organs should be distributed to save the lives of others (who will die without the new organs) so they don't have to commit suicide (the sense in which you are using \"commit suicide\")?\n\nIf that is your position it is unorthodox and immoral.\nbobbaphet: Nope, no one should be killed to save another, unless you are talking about committing suicide because you don't want to kill plants...talk about unreasonable...\njohnbentley: &gt; Nope, no one should be killed to save another.\n\nRight, then why would it be right to kill a plant, who counts as one if they are self conscious, to save the lives of others?\n\nIf they don't count as one in virtue of self consciousness what criteria do you use before a being counts as deserving the right to life?\nbobbaphet: I already answered that but you just can't understand it...\njohnbentley: Point to your answer.\nbobbaphet: &gt;because committing suicide is literally insane...\njohnbentley: But you are happy for those who have faulty organs to commit suicide rather than kill another for their healthy organs.\n\nYou believe your own position to be insane.\nbobbaphet: That is quite literally the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard...\njohnbentley: That's question begging.\nbobbaphet: No it isn't. It's my opinion of your statements...\njohnbentley: The question is (at least one form of it) \"Why is self consciousness as a criteria for the saving or taking of life wrong?\"\n\nJust asserting that self consciousness is the wrong criteria (by calling it \"insane\") is not anywhere near an attempt to explain why. That is what makes it question begging. \n\nAny attempts by me to have you get at the details end up with you studiously avoiding those details. It is as if you but your fingers in your ears and just shout: \"It's insane, it's insane\". \n\nI illustrate why no one can seriously hold the view in some cases letting your self die ('committing suicide' as you characterise it, a plausible characterisation) rather than take the life of another is morally good. But you persist with \"committing suicide is literally insane\".\nbobbaphet: You're insane. Seek professional help.\njohnbentley: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem\nbobbaphet: If you actually knew what Ad hominem was, you wouldn't be saying that. Ad hominem can only occur in the context of an argument. I was not making an argument, I was just telling you you should seek professional help because you're insane. \njohnbentley: Your response to my argument is to characterise it as so wrong to be evidence of insanity. Your response is paradigmatic ad hominem. Whether I'm insane or not has no bearing on the truth of my claims or the validity of my argument.\nbobbaphet: I don't care about your argument. I'm just saying you're insane. :)\njohnbentley: Then it's a plain old non sequitur.\nbobbaphet: So what?\njohnbentley: It is irrelevant.\nbobbaphet: Yes, your arguments are irrelevant, I agree.\njohnbentley: No your claim of insanity is.\nbobbaphet: No it isn't.\njohnbentley: Yes, this is the meaning of a non sequitur. The conclusion in no way follows from the premises. \nbobbaphet: Is this an actual person talking? or some alien robot computer?\njohnbentley: That still doesn't address the issue. Your intellectual dishonesty is complete. Your next move is to try and claim to be a troll, to make it seem that you really could explain your sincere views if you wanted to.\nbobbaphet: It's wrong to not eat plants because not doing so would kill yourself. What part about that can you not understand? It's quite simple, a 5th grader could understand it. Holy god man...\njohnbentley: But it is not always wrong to kill yourself. The organ case shows that. In the organ case why is it not wrong to kill yourself?\nbobbaphet: Completely false. Dying from a failed organ is not the same as killing yourself. It's dying from a failed organ...\njohnbentley: At last! Some progress!\n\nYou can differentiate \"killing yourself\" or \"commit suicide\" from letting yourself die. If by \"committing suicide\" or \"killing yourself\" you mean taking active steps to end your life then this (edit: is) plausibly different from letting yourself die by failing to act. This second kind of death we could call \"death by omission\".\n\nDying from a failed organ is death by omission, you don't kill another human and you therefore die. So too in the plant case, you don't kill a plant and therefore you die.\n\nBoth cases are death by omission.\n\n\nbobbaphet: You can twist it around however you see fit, your statements are still totally ridiculous. Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: Why would one case by death by omission and not the other?\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\n\nCommon sense: \"sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts.\", \"\"the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way\"\n\nSomething that you are lacking.\njohnbentley: If both cases aren't death by omission (you've been good in allowing the assumption that there are no alternatives to a plant sourced diet) it should be very easy for you to say why, using common sense or whatever you like.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: Repeating that phrase just reveals your unwillingness to address the point made. A point made clearly and plainly. \n\nIt could be because you start to feel the weakness of your own position but I think it more likely that you are unused to the most basic level of intellectual enquiry.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: So if you are very young, you don't have to wait for your faculties to mature to start exercising basic thinking and arguing skills. You could join a local book reading club, for example, in order to become used to addressing and discussing issues. \n\nAt the moment you are incapable of disagreement.

As far as having the cinders filled, my neighbor had that done and its a waste of money.

There is still enough mass in the cinder that is not insulated to have the same 100+ walls on the inside.\n\nEdit 3 - So the Foamboard Will give me the best R value per inch?  Thanks for the link for this old house. Thats basically what I was looking at doing as far as the foamboard goes. Then I can just add the wood strips and pull the electrical out another 3 or so inches and add the sheetrock. Do they make insulative sheet rock?\n\nTrying to get as much out of it as I can I really would like to stay 4 or less inches on each wall but If I need to do more I need to do more I guess. \n\n\nshuffler: Commercial insulation contractor here (not residential, but I hope I help), you have a variety of options:\n\n* if you do not want to do anything to the inside or outside, have an injection foam contractor come in and pump your cinder blocks full of insulating foam. \n\n* if you don't mind going on the outside of the house, I agree with SgianDubh in that you should put a radiant barrier on the outside of the house and then some sort of insulation on the inside of the house (foam in the blocks or fur out the interior). the radiant on the outside will reflect a good chunk (the 97% they claim is garbage) of the radiant energy hitting your south and west walls for heat gain, but doesn't help against the cold.\n\n* if you are furring out the inside, extruded polystyrene foam insulation will give you the most r-value per inch. It is my understanding that you can put the foam board directly against the block wall, tape the seams, foam the cracks at the bottom and top of the wall and it can be considered your vapor barrier. [You can see this done in a basement here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jSuWbdJy5A). For better or worse, I'm a believer in what Mike Holmes does.  The foam board will get you R-5 per inch where the fiberglass and cellulose is R-3. Keep in mind that the foam board will cost you much more than just glass or cellulose, but I think that it may work better for you. Once you have the board up and taped you can build your stud wall and insulate with fiberglass if you want. I would skip the vapor barrier with the stud wall. The trick of this is, like CvilleTallMan said, assuming that these walls are above grade and that you live in phoenix, moisture is not such an issue like it is here in the northern plains. You can probably just use a 6-mil poly over the studs with fiberglass you put in yourself or sprayed in cellulose by a contractor.  I'm just always worried that cellulose will settle. I have seen it happen too many times for it to be just a random occurrence. \n\n* do NOT glue your drywall to the block or foam board. Take the time to fur out a wall and run your outlets, etc.. You will thank me later.\nBowzer84: Expanded foam was my first thought too. seems like it would be relatively easy to pour/inject it right down into the cinder blocks.\nwickedpissa: you'll still have a crazy amount of thermal bridging reducing the insulating factors greatly.\nrcrracer: Test have proven your statement is correct.\n", "prompt": "zykal: Insulating a room that has  exterior hollow cinder walls 1950's construction\nI live in a house built in the 1950's in phx AZ I have 2 rooms that the south facing wall and a west and East facing wall in the respective rooms are bare Hollow cinder.

{"full_text": "mastair86: Am I on the right track now?\nSorry for the long story, if you don\u2019t have the time or urge to read it, move along. Otherwise I appreciate your time.\n\n\nI am 30 yo, 193 cm (6\u20194\u201d) and 83.5 kg (184 lbs). I guess purely based on these numbers not that bad, but still what you probably would call skinny fat, but now I feel like I want to change this. See http://imgur.com/a/Al8L9 for pictures (sorry for the angles).\n\n\nLet me first introduce my story by a few lines.\n\n\nNever done a lot of exercising in the past. 4 years ago, I graduated from university and since then I am working as software engineer and consultant which hasn\u2019t been that positive in terms of my physical performance (100% of time sitting behind computer.). I like my job very much, I would say I am very ambitious and feel very responsible for all that happens. Then after 1 year of working I started developing RSI symptoms (cold hands, painful wrists, not able to lay your arms onto anything really), for which I saw numerous specialist of which none of them could help me and told me that I would have to live with it, and so I did. Then after a couple of months I started developing neck and back pain, which got through to my head as headaches. I never called myself in sick though, and continued working like a mad man, most weeks longer than needed and even in the evening colleagues got replies to their e-mails from me. I started seeing Cesar (I guess that term is only used in NL) and Mensendieck therapists to improve my posture and went to manual therapists to somehow improve my back and neck pain, but it never cured it. Then in summer last year, I started getting real dizzy, a couple of times (almost) fainting and a neurologist concluded it was chronical hyperventilation. I got breathing and relaxation therapy which helped somewhat until December last year I got tingling issues in both legs and arms and stings in my head and got again very dizzy. It was only then that I realized I could not continue like that, and called myself in sick.\n\n\nSo went back to the GP, and after some checks again with neurologist he concluded psychosomatic symptoms. Seeing psychology therapist now, and continuing Cesar therapy and manual therapy, and things got a little better, though I am not cured. Working only 2 half days a week. Though since last week I feel things got a tiny little better.\n\n\nIn the meantime, I am trying everything to get rid of my issues, of which one is bodyweight fitness.\n\n\nMy overall goal, body mind wise:\n\n* Getting and feeling stronger, not like a 70 yo in a 30 yo body..\n* I\u2019d like to get leaner (get rid of fatty manboobs and belly)..\n\nWhat I am doing now (next to therapies):\n\n* 3 x a week recommended routine (since ~2 months) to get strength back in core, and I actually feel like it\u2019s fun, though I\u2019m a little bit impatient. Would like to get to freestanding HS eventually and getting leaner and more body. Already saw quite some progress in terms of planking times, but also moved from vertical rows to almost horizontal, wall pushup to full push up. Doing L-sit with one leg up now, etc.\n* 1 x a week Yoga (since a month), more of a relaxation yoga with only 7 poses and finishing off with half an hour of meditation\n* Loads of walking\n* On average 1 x swimming a week\n* On average 0 \u2013 1 x running a week (0.5 hrs)\n* Reading \u201cThe mindbody prescription\u201d on TMS of John Sarno to understand how the psychosomatic symptoms are developed and how to influence them. I realize now that it may indeed be repressed childhood trauma that causes my symptoms.\n* Doing some meditation on my own using Headspace app\n* Applying rational emotive therapy\n* I\u2019m on Keto diet with 20% calorie deficit, I guess this also helps me to feel a little more energized, and hopefully it gets me a bit leaner without destroying muscles. I feel like it, but I do not see a lot of progress now I am looking at my own pictures.\n\n\nNow I am curious what you think about what I am doing at the moment! Should I change something?  Am I doing too much, or too little? Do you see progress in the pics? I could ask very specific questions which I won\u2019t, so I hope to get more general feedback as well. One specific question though, what bf % do you think I have now?\n\nyaoz889: You seem to be progressing, which is great. Just make sure you consume enough protein, so you maintain your gains. I suggest you add jump rope if you can, just to increase the speed of your progression. Like 5-10 min in the mornings right after you wake up.\nKrygess: Would 5-10 minutes of early morning jump rope be more for cardio or to increase calorie deficit? That sounds like an easy enough thing to implement for me. Just would like to know what it would benefit most. \nyaoz889: More for cardio. If you look at the research online, jumping rope is up there as one of the top excercises out there. However, jumping 10min straight is not easy.\nI just started a few weeks ago and I just try the best I can every morning.\nKrygess: I really just meant devoting the time to it. Not actually jumping rope for that long straight. I'm optimistic for the most part, but that'd be dumb to think I could do it right away. \n\nBut thanks for the information!

I am holding a UV flashlight in my hand to make it glow.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/6LyOQ\nPhotoandGrime: Cheers, I know what vitamin B2 is ;P. I've used it many times before to create glow food, I made these yellow glow noodles with them for example: http://imgur.com/KrjxXe8 or this green glow jelly:http://i.imgur.com/XGRBfSR.gifv. You can also make Turmeric UV reactive by adding pure alcohol to it btw! Not to use in food though, but other glow experiments :). \njagedlion: If you are using to use high proof EtOH (I used everclear), another really cool one is just mint. (I guess any other plant, but mint is actually tasty)  I don't have a great pic on my phone, just a boring one.  But chlorophyll, while UV opaque, also fluoresces purple-red.  So if you shine the beam on them, while none of the light penetrates, the surface where the beam is aimed turns from green to glowing red.  It's quite striking, but the fluorescence seems to pretty much vanish if you add water.\n\nI still haven't found something that keeps a nice red glow in aqueous solvents.\nPhotoandGrime: XD Hahaha cheers, I know this too! I have a youtube channel dedicated to glow stuff hehe. I made UV reactive cupcakes with chlorophyll: http://i.imgur.com/Oo7s319.gifv. Green in normal light, pink in black light. I have two recipes in which I used chlorophyll online. You can extract chlorophyll with oil, butter or pure alcohol. Unfortunately the pure alcohol version isn't edible of course, and indeed, water destroys the UV reactiveness of chlorophyll. A shame, because I would love to create an edible colour pigment with it without butter/oil, so you can colour a bunch of food. I have done a bunch of experiments but haven't found a solution to it as of now. Where does your fascination for glow food come from?\njagedlion: I started making glowing test-tube shooters in college.  Classic vodka-tonic with a little artificial flavoring and sometimes coloring.  But I didn't go back to it until more recently.  My wife had a friend who was graduating with her PhD in philosophy of science, so I thought it would be fun to have a science themed meal.  I figure I do enough microscopy I should be able to enhance my old gamut.\n\nWe made some tonic from cinchona bark (which came out _ok_ but I wouldn't recommend it) and I then made a range of colored drinks.  The blue and green were easy, but for red I just made the mint extract, and then mixed it into mojitos for guests.  Makes a GREAT drink mixed because it tastes like you just freshly muddled the mint into the drink.  And it's still fun to see someone add a glowing ingredient to the drink even if it doesn't stay glowing.\nPhotoandGrime: Sounds cool :)! I made UV reactive edible oil with chlorophyll once; specifically chlorella supplements. You can use spirulina as well, but personally I really dislike the smell and taste of spirulina so I used chlorella. I used it as edible face paint, in recipes (pink/red buttercream), but also in a drink (http://i.imgur.com/dHyuyfR.gifv). I put a little bit of it in milk, and since it's an oil, it floats. Because milk has a lot of fat in it, the colour doesn't dissolve. And actually, it's not bad at all to drink (especially if you sweeten the milk or make a mix drink). Sure, you get a bit of an oily taste, but it's not like you're drinking a whole glass of oil hehe. It's nice to 'meet' a fellow glow food appreciator haha! You know what I really find annoying about all UV reactive ingredients? They are either pretty bitter or a pain in the ass to extract (chlorophyll). You'd think with their glow effect in ultraviolet light, they would be sweet as well, but vitamin B2, Quinine and turmeric all don't taste too well without being mixed with other (sweet) ingredients. ;P\n", "prompt": "PhotoandGrime: Edible UV glow lightsaber\n\njagedlion: Use a little bit of vitamin B2: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F7URNTE\n\nYou can make a bright yellow green one.

The truth is murky and complicated.\nbackstageninja: I'm not sure what the 5-10% more gasoline bit is about, but replace that with \"instead of using cheaper/safer alternatives\" and the spirit is absolutely correct. The auto and chemical industries paid for fake studies to promote the safety of lead just like the tobacco companies did for their products even though they *knew* they were dangerous. And the reason lead was eventually taken out of gasoline wasn't a health or safety or environmental concern, it was because leaded gas ruined catalytic converters.\n\nIf you have a problem with the tone I'm sorry, but this one issue that absolutely is not murky or nuanced. These companies knew the dangers, knew the alternatives and *purposely* put everyone at risk for the sake of profits.

What are you figuring out 'just now'?\n\npoiklpu: I just saw the secretariat and while not the greatest movie by any means, it made me think about something. (spoilers ahead) the lead character, a housewife, takes control over her father's horses because he has Alzheimer's and his wife just died. The father then dies and she's given control of the horses, and her brother control of the estate. The estate will need 6 million to continue to run and by now Secretariat could be worth 7 million. She is eventually is offered 8 mill but ultimately declines, and this is important. She declines because she believes the horse can win the triple crown (a feat not accomplished in decades) and the horse will be worth it by the end of it. Because this is a disney movie of course the horse ends up winning the three races, and winning the final race (longest of the three) by a margin of about 30 horses. I'm pretty sure his time and distance hasn't been beaten to this day which is kind of amazing actually. But onto the point of all this. \n\nIn the race right before the first triple crown race, Secretariat had a sore in his mouth and ended up taking third, and if this happened in any of the triple crown races it would have lessened the horses value after the fact. And that made me think. If Secretariat happened to lose some or all of the triple crown races, the owner would have seemed crazy. Following the races, the brother and her husband would have said that they were right when they told her they shouldn't sold the horse. Also I'm sure in any future arguments with the husband and her, financial or otherwise, would have, more often than not, ended in the husbands favor. Probably with the underlying notion that \"the wife makes bad decisions, gets caught up in fanciful, sensationalized ideas, and is a bit crazy, and the husband thinks rationally and makes the decision that's 'right.\" I'd also go as far as to say that most everyone would have looked down on her because she put her family in debt with the risk she took. History would have forgotten her as a woman who literally bet the farm and lost, but instead she goes down as the woman who fostered the greatest racehorse ever.\n\nSo history would have looked at her as crazy for the rest of her life or a genius based on how one decision panned out. One decision. This racehorse could have been training one day and a blade of grass could have been floating in the wind, or a bug could have been flying along the track and either of them could have gotten into his eye, caused the beginning of an infection and made the racehorse unfit to race until after the last race. She would then be considered crazy for sending her family into debt and trying to win a race no one had won in 20 some odd years. It made me realize that depending on how much risk someone takes, we can deem someone incredibly wise or ridiculously foolish by the **outcome** of a decision. Not by the decision itself, but by how it pans out. It seems a bit insane to me that we as a society can look at two different women who make the same exact decisions, who take the same risk, but call one an incredible dreamer, and one a sensationalist young woman, all depending on the position of a blade of grass? **tldr:**Maybe i'm overthinking a simple children's movie but if it's the people who make the big risks who drive innovation in our society, the people who put their life savings in to an idea they don't know will work, or mortgage their house to see if their hypothesis will hold true in an experiment that is costly, how can we as a society fault them if their idea doesn't pan out? \nChickenOfDoom: Because our society is obsessed with the idea that the individual has absolute control over his/her destiny. We can all make it big as long as we're just good enough to do it, and those who don't become one of the elite were just too lazy/stupid/unskilled.\n\nBasically, our class system is propped up by an illusionary meritocracy based on our collective denial of chance as a major factor in our lives.\n", "prompt": "Botunda: I wished that I realized that I mattered more in life.

A more fair distribution would obviously be prefered, but this is the real world we are talking about, not a pipedream, and thus my opinions will reflect reality.\n\nEquality of opportunity is crucial to ensure that everyone has a fair shot at achieving their dreams. \n\nEquality of outcome starts to become more evil because you are not allowing people to benefit fully from their own labor and risk, while people that are not contributing their fair share end up with a free ride that just hurts the rest of society.\n\nSo through which mechanism would the redistribution be enforced?\nZellNorth: Who said anything about redistribution? Again, you\u2019re thinking too much. My question is ethical, not political. If given the choice between evenly distributed wealth or a few having the majority of the world\u2019s currency, which would you choose?\nLiberty_Call: You are trying to ask a pointless question then. If we do not take into account the reality of the world around us, you are just making noise.\n\nTo go from the situation we have no to one that has a more equal distribution will require some sort of action, no?\nZellNorth: Yes and I\u2019m getting there but we have to ask the ethical question first. If there is no ethical dilemma there doesn\u2019t need to be any action taken. So if you think there is no reason to be alarmed by .000000005% of the population having a majority of the wealth there is no reason to even have a conversation. \n\nThe guy I responded to seemed to think there was some sort of villainification of the wealthy. \nLiberty_Call: &gt;So if you think there is no reason to be alarmed by .000000005% of the population having a majority of the wealth there is no reason to even have a conversation. \n\nI never said I was not alarmed.\n\nWhy are you making things up and attributing them to me?\nZellNorth: I said \u201cif\u201d. I\u2019m asking questions to find where you stand. I don\u2019t know what questions to ask you cause you spend so many responses not answering my question (:\nLiberty_Call: You dont know what questions to ask because you refuse to read what I am writing and take it into account.\n\nYou are demanding that I pretend this is not happening in the real world, which is ridiculous and pointless.\n\nRead what my responses are saying instead of just discounting them out of hand.\n\nYou have also not explained why you are making stuff up and claiming I am stating it. Why are you acting in such bad faith?\nZellNorth: That\u2019ll lead to having two different conversations. I refuse to answer your questions cause they are irrelevant to what I\u2019m asking. I don\u2019t know what to ask you cause you kept trying to change the subject. \nLiberty_Call: So you resort to making stuff up and pretending I said it?\n\nWhy?\nZellNorth: I didn\u2019t make anything up. Go reread what I said. \nLiberty_Call: So if that was really just a question and not accusatory, how were you supposed to figure that out without letting me explain my reasoning for my opinion?\n\nThis still sounds like you just wanted people to agree with you and won't engage with anyone that is not just blindly agreeing.\nZellNorth: My goal in any discussion is to find the common ground. I\u2019m not here to debate. The us vs them mentality that exists in this current climate has made people forget how to have a discussion. For instance, in this conversation I was trying to find the thing we can both agree with, \u201cspreading the wealth is fundamentally morally good\u201d. That\u2019s the thing I thought we could all agree on. If that\u2019s the case the discussion can then become, how do we achieve that. We would have gotten to redistribution of wealth eventually and then maybe a debate could ensue. But if we have no common ground to stand on, it\u2019s not even a debate, thats an argument. \n\nYour first initial response to me was instantly to create a wall. You defended your point when I didn\u2019t even attack it. I would actually tend to agree with you, but you weren\u2019t interested in a conversation you were interested in being right. Maybe you thought you could prove your point so well I would concede you to be the better man, I don\u2019t know. \n\nThe man in the original article we are commenting on sees the value in redistribution of wealth and I\u2019d love to see more of that. How can we come to a conclusion that sees money spread out among more of the population. We can only figure that when we all decide that it\u2019s the right thing to do. \nLiberty_Call: Then you should really approach the situation in a more open minded way rather than the us (the poor) vs them (the rich) way you have been.\n\n&gt; I was trying to find the thing we can both agree with, \u201cspreading the wealth is fundamentally morally good\u201d.\n\nThis depends on quite a bit. I firmly believe in and follow the mantra, \"From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.\n\nThat means if someone is not performing and contributing to society to the best of their ability, it is actually harmful to redistributed wealth to those folks.\n\nIt is not as simple as just ensuring equality of outcome because that is bad for the people that contrubute.\n\nWhen u started talki.g about what the redistribution of wealth would look like you refused to talk about it.\n\nStop trying to over simplify complex situations. It does not do any good and only fosters ignorance.\n\nNow that you have admitted that redistribution was what you were driving towards this whole time, what will that look like? How do you redistribute wealth that is tied up in assets that are need to keep the economy running and people working?\nZellNorth: I was never given a chance to be open minded cause you kept changing the subject. I was attempting to keep the conversation on topic. \n\nRedistribution like what the gentleman in the article did is a good start. I\u2019m over this conversation though. Took way too long to get here and my attention is gone. \nLiberty_Call: You need to ask questions that can be answered by people that understand what is going on.\n\nIf you really cared about this topic you would not be asking yes or no questions and getting upset when people try to get more info or answer them appropriately.\n\nStop pretending to care then getting upset when someone is informed enough to realize your questions are silly and unanswerable in good faith.\nZellNorth: lol ok\n", "prompt": "speckz: Aldi introduces wages higher than the \u2018real living wage\u2019 after supermarket has record year\n\nraliberti2:..and they maintain reasonable prices on their products so people can actually afford to eat well\ngiuseppe443: and the owner of aldi s\u00fcd was until his death in 2014 the richest man in germany \nTrumpImpeachedAugust: That's an aspect of wealth inequality that *really* pisses me off.

Of course there are conservative scientists and progressive religious types, but I'm sure for every conservative scientist you find me, I can find you ten progressive/liberal ones, and for every progressive religious person, I can find you ten prominent conservative religious types. More to the point of what I was getting at is that this is how it *feels* to be, science is progressive and religion is conservative. I guess I'll just say why I think this is: Scientists want to know what is right, the religious want to feel like they know what is right. If what the religious thought was right is constantly changing, they can never be certain whether what they know is really correct or not. Nowadays, religion needs to be progressive if it wants to survive, but that is because its being pushed by progressive science and social change. \n\nReligion has stayed religion because it doesn't really have anywhere to go; its a bunch of stuff people thought up to explain the world, and then they attached their wildest dreams of ultimate justice and eternal life to it. Furthermore, religion *claims* to be the basis upon which philosophy is founded, it claims to know the beings which established thought itself and morality and so on. I think if anything, religion will eventually change *into* mere philosophy, instead of being something that merely contains philosophy, seeing as belief in the supernatural wanes when it comes into contact with scientific information (that is to say, knowledge of how the world actually works) and that information is only going to spread more rapidly with the advent of the internet.\nUberMonkey21: but you didn't say \"most\".\n\nbut your idea intrigues me.\n&gt;I think if anything, religion will eventually change into mere philosophy, instead of being something that merely contains philosophy, seeing as belief in the supernatural wanes when it comes into contact with scientific information\n\nare you then saying that religion(s) will converge as the supernatural disappears, i.e. walking on water, and the underlying ethics, i.e. the golden rule, become more apparent? \nOnce converged, would it, when stripped of all mysticism, be purely altruistic?\nWould it actually work then, i.e., following the golden rule, or would become corrupted as it has before/is?\n\n  \nkadmylos: Not necessarily converge, though they do all have that core of the Golden Rule, etc, but they all have their differences too.

There is literally not enough hours in the day to protests for all available causes. Even if you don't go to a rally and just want to donate 10$ for a cause. Donating 10$ for every cause is a whole lot of money. Also not every charity does what they say they do.

BLM are trying to end racism against African Americans and ALM, at least in theory, wants to end racism.

{"full_text": "Top_Conversation9940: How do I adapt my workouts to an injury?\nSo a day ago I strained my left rhomboid while doing an upper body workout. To provide some useful information on how the injury happened:\n\nFirst exercise in the workout I did was pull ups for 5 sets. The sets looked like 8-8-7-7-6 and 8 is the most reps I can do in a set so I was pushing myself pretty hard. This is the first time I tried arch body technique which I think is why the injury happened. Before I had been doing only hollow body pull ups which is more beginner friendly. Hollow body pull ups use more of your lats. Arch body puts more work on your upper back than the lats, which are way bigger so they can take more stress. Anyways, the injury actually occured in my next exercise which was chin ups. It's not because I did pull ups and followed that with chin ups, I have done that many times before with no problems and I used only hollow body technique. So the take away is beginners should only use hollow body and avoid arch body before reaching 10-12 reps of pull ups. And before building proper proprioception and mind-muscle connection.\n\nI need to give it time to recover but I also don't want to stop working. I have been working out for a few months now so not a complete beginner but still a beginner. How do I adapt my upper body workouts? Pull ups and chin ups are a no go, so are rows. Are there any pull movements I can do? Do I just do pushing movements?\nthergoat: Solid recovery strategy:\n\n1. Avoid active use of that muscle group (so, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, rows, face pulls, etc) altogether (push and pull) during workouts for 1-2 weeks. \n2. Get plenty of sleep\n3. Eat a nutritious diet \n4. Drink plenty of water \n5. Stretch within a comfortable range of motion (I.e. provide minor stimulation to the area)\n6. Consult a Physical therapist immediately if this persists and causes pain during general/daily use \n\nThe goal right now isn\u2019t to get stronger, it is to heal. \n\nThe goal right now isn\u2019t to get stronger, it is to heal. \n\nIf you think I wrote that twice by accident, read both lines 2-3 more times.

Just for fun let me tell my story. I had some rhomboid injuries over the years at the point i could not breathe caused by weighted and explosive pulll ups. Me be me i ignored those and rested max two days after i got them. Always managed and injury got better but in the beginning it happened once every six months, then every three then every month etc etc. The accumulated scar tissue caused me to lose mobility in the thoracic region. Both in workouts and everyday life i used my lumbar region to perform movements by flexing it to balance the lack of mobility in my thoracic region.

Essentially, a cold frame functions as a miniature [greenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse) to [extend the growing season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_extension).\n\n&gt;Historically cold frames were built to be used in addition to a heated [greenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse). The name itself exemplifies the distinction between the warm greenhouse and the unheated cold frame. They were frequently built as part of the greenhouse's foundation brickwork along the southern wall (in northern latitudes). This allowed seeds to be germinated in the greenhouse and then easily moved to the attached cold frame to be \"hardened-off\"  before final planting outside.  Cold frames are similar to some enclosed [hotbeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotbed_(gardening\\)),  also called hotboxes. The difference is in the amount of heat generated inside. This is parallel to the way that some greenhouses are called \"hothouses\" to emphasize their higher temperature, achieved either by the solar effects alone or by auxiliary heating via a [heater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heater) or [HVAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC) system of some kind.\n\n&gt;Cold frames are found in [home gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_gardens) and in [vegetable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable) farming.

Go away dude, youre a hypocrite  and you have a GIANT double standard. \n\nIf one law is wrong for telling women what to wear against their will, then ALL laws are wrong for telling women what to wear against their will.\nGaMa-Binkie: **Why aren\u2019t you outraged that men can\u2019t wear a burka and cover their face as the law covers all people and not just women?**\nEliotisnotconfused: If a man desperatly wants to in a liberal country then he should be allowed to.\n\nAgain, its about choice you fuck head. \n\nEither choice for ALL or restrictions for ALL.\n\nThe west likes to act like they want choice for ALL, yet surpress the choice of muslim women or other people who want to wear a burka.\nGaMa-Binkie: Keep seething that there are Muslim women who can feel the warmth of the sun on their skin, the breeze flow through their hair and breath fresh air, without fear of persecution.\n\nIf you really cared about women\u2019s rights you wouldn\u2019t be whingeing about all people not being allowed cover their face in one country and would be talking about\n\n[All the Islamic countries have it legal for men to rape their wives due to the Quran specifically leaving wives out of the definitionof rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_laws_by_country)\n&gt; \"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\".\n\n[And all the Islamic countries where a woman's word only counts for a half of a mans in court.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_women%27s_testimony_in_Islam)\n\nBut we both know the truth is that you don't care about women's rights and just want to justify your shitty sexist views\nEliotisnotconfused: Strawman arguments....\n\nAlso, the Quran verses have specific meanings.

Thats sexist. VERY sexist. Youre acting like women cant make their own choices and need men like you to tell them if wearing a burka is good for them or not. \n\nMany women want to wear a burka. By restricting them, youre oppressing them. \n\nYoure a sexist hypocrite with a double standard, who is unable to make proper research on an argument, nor is able to use his brain.

Thats all thats wrong with you.\nGaMa-Binkie: &gt; Strawman arguments....\n\nYou clearly don't know what a strawman is\n\nWhy are you handwaving Islam's definition of rape and it's detrimental effects on women, you know, those people whose rights you definitely support. The definition is not up for debate or interpretation, it is clear and concise.\n\n\"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\".\n\n31 Muslim countries have marital rape legalized due to this definition, yet you do not care for obvious reasons\n\n1.

When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down. Let a scribe write it down in justice between you. Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so let him write. Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must fear Allah, his Lord, and diminish not anything of what he owes. But if the debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is unable himself to dictate, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her.\nEliotisnotconfused: Rape is a major sin in Islam and can get you terrible punishments in Sharia Law, you ignorant. You can literally google it, as thats what the Sunnah says.

Intercourse is only allowed if both agree. \n\nYou can simply google.\nGaMa-Binkie: Under Islam's definition which is the definition most Islamic countries follow, Rape is only when\n\n\"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\".\nEliotisnotconfused: That doesnt change the fact that intercourse can only happen when both agree. \n\nIt isnt called \"rape\" after the defintion that you mentioned, but it still isnt allowed, the way you act like you do.\nGaMa-Binkie: Link to the exact quote you\u2019re referencing or stop spreading false information.\n\nThe definition is clear in its meaning\n&gt;\"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\".\nEliotisnotconfused: Its still unlawful to force your wife to sleep with you. \n\nIt may not be called \"rape\", but its still not allowed.\n\nhttps://www.abuaminaelias.com/consent-marriage-concubines/\n\nTo quote:\n\n\"Consent in lawful sexual relations (that is, a valid marriage) is an important moral consideration in Islam. After all, marriage should be based upon love and mercy, as stated in the Quran, and part of a healthy sexual relationship is the mutual pleasure experienced by both parties. Any form of sexual violence has been and always will be unlawful in Islam. [...]\n\n[...] Since mutual pleasure is one of the acknowledged purposes of lawful sex, it naturally cannot be attained by force, compulsion, or violence.\"\n\nThis opinion has been held by scholars since the early days. Its from people who studied Islam and who know Islam better then we do combined.\n\nHere. Its unlawful to do that. \n\nIt doesnt need to be called rape to be unlawful. Just shows your ignorance.\n\nAlso, you cannot learn Islam from just a few articles, which is why you have such a wrong and misinformed view that is so easy to call out.\nGaMa-Binkie: So you don't actually site anything from the Quran that would specifically go against the definition \n&gt; \"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse **by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him**, without her free will and consent\".\n\nIf they thought raping your wife was wrong why would they specifically say \"who is not legally married to him\" why not leave this part out?\n\nThe intention is clear and 31 Islamic countries following this definition just confirms it\nEliotisnotconfused: Dear Lord are you stupid?\n\nJust because it isnt called \"rape\" doesnt mean that ITS ALLOWED. \n\nThis site is from scholars. They know Islam more then you do. They also got their opinion FROM the Quran, because the Quran says that marriage is for love and that pleasure should be for both. \n\nIf a man rapes his wife, was there pleasure for both? No. Therefore, its not allowed.\n\nYou dont get Islam and arent ready for an Islamic discussion even at its lowest level.\nGaMa-Binkie: Lol, the cognitive dissonance is palpable.\n\nIf they think it's wrong, why did they specifically leave it out of the definition, thus making it legal.\nEliotisnotconfused: Youre stupid. Borderline stupid....\n\nYou simply dont understand Islam. \n\nRape is different back then then it was today. Marriage is different in Islam then it is to you Westerners. \n\nMarriage by itself is some form of \"consent\", as its a very important bond between a man and a woman and they only marry under important conditions, unlike in the West, were marriage isnt like that, but as I said Marriage still has its rules and conditions. \n\nOne of these conditions is that pleasure has be for both. So while its technically not seen as \"rape\" its still is not allowed and will be punished if violent sex acts are forced upon a partner, as it will not lead to pleasure and love for both. \n\nAlso, theres a hadith that says that the best men are those who are kind to their wives. \n\nSo how can a man that forces his wife for sex be lawful in Islam, as it goes against the rules for men and against the conditions for marriage????\n\nThink and use your brain. Before you reply, think about it for 20 minutes very clearly and open mindedly. Hopefully then you will understand why youre wrong.\nGaMa-Binkie: Lol, saying men who are kind to their wives are the coolest isn\u2019t justification for having marital rape legalised.\n\nThe definition specifically allows for it, there is no argument to be had\nEliotisnotconfused: Thanks for admitting that you do not understand Islam, even after its explained to you. \n\nDo not argue about Islam, as youre the most ignorant person Ive ever seen. \n\nIve shown proof, I shown that forced sex is against the conditions of marriage, but you still say its allowed.\n\nOne more time:\n\nIts not definded as the WORD \"Rape\". ITS JUST NOT CALLED THE WORD RAPE.  But it STILL ISNT ALLOWED. \n\nIf you deny this, then youre one of the dumbest, most ignorant and idiotic people that exist. \n\nJust because its not in the definition of rape doesnt mean its allowed. HOW HARD IS IT TO UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU MORON?\nGaMa-Binkie: Not including marital rape under the definition of rape shows that they don\u2019t hold it in that regard. \n\nMost Islamic countries following this definition and having marital rape legalised and go unpunished further confirms it.\n\nYou are trying to justify the un-justifiable, which you\u2019ve proven is impossible with your weak, incoherent and inconsistent arguments\nEliotisnotconfused: Its not rape, but it still is forbidden. How hard is it to understand? \n\nI even explained why its forbidden.\nGaMa-Binkie: Think for a second, why would it be explicitly excluded from the definition of it was Haram\nEliotisnotconfused: Are you fucking braindead?\n\nIts excluded from the definition because its not rape in Islam.\n\nBut that doesnt make it allowed. Sins can be not rape, but still be forbidden. \n\nIt doesnt need to be rape to not be allowed. Why do you think this?\n\nAnd I already explained WHY its forbidden multiple times, as it goes against the conditions marriage. \n\nTheres no argument to be had. Its not rape, but still forbidden as it goes against the conditions of marriage and sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. \n\nUse your brain. I explained it enough times now, you idiot.\nGaMa-Binkie: Why go to the effort of excluding it from the definition of rape if it\u2019s forbidden anyway?\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s Hala to sexually assault your wife \ud83e\udd14\nEliotisnotconfused: Its not rape. \n\nBut its still forbidden. \n\nTwo things can be true at once. \n\nAnd I told you WHY it was forbidden already.\nGaMa-Binkie: Nope, under Islam marriage counts as forever consent so there\u2019s no punishment for raping your wife\n\nIslam and most of its followers approve of this definition\nEliotisnotconfused: The article I showed disproves that. Read it, as it explains that very well.\n\nMarriage has rules. Forcing your wife is against that, as it doesnt mean pleasure for both and marriage is kindness and love towards each other. Violence has no place in that. \n\nAnd no, most of muslims do not approve. Im muslim and have touch to the muslim community aswell as knowledge about it. I can guarantee that most do not agree.\n\nIm proving something. Explaining something. \n\nI literally explained why its forbidden.

I think if I wasn't doing grip training deadhangs I wouldn't even be able to hang off a bar. \n\nWould appreciate advice. Either put my head down and continue building reps with CC step  (I'm currently up to about 19 on the first set, 12 on the second.

I've spent over 1 year stuck on some exercise then suddenly progress super fast once I discovered the weakness in my training.

I don't know how dedicated you are to CC, but I also suggest you abandon it (AT LEAST for pull ups; you can work on the other big 6 if you like) in favor of a different progression method. Depending on your goals, I think you can achieve full PU and OAPU following a simpler path. \n\nSo here's what I'd do if I were you. \n\n#1 do (or build up to) 3x5 sets of FULL, slow negatives for your PU training. No more jack knife pulls. \n\n#2 I don't know the rest of your workout, but if this is an important goal, put the negatives in the beginning of the workout. \n\n#3 Once you are more confident with your negatives, give PUs a shot again. If you can do 1 set of 3 reps, I'd say thats enough to move on from negatives and start training PUs themselves. Work up to 3x5 again.\n\n#4 If you have spare weight in the form of fat, focus on losing some of it through healthier/reduced eating. This will not only help your PUs but all other BW exercises.

I don't have a problem with polyamory, but a system where a man can have an unlimited number of wives to use and control does seem morally and ethically suspect. If people have freedom to choose, education, opportunities it doesn't seem like a relationship that is based on women being property would organically arise. While monogamy has it's roots in property exchange, we have dating today, marriage is based on friendship, love, affection, commitment regardless of gender and not the economic and political institution it was originally created to be. Egalitarian group marriage is a whole nother can of worms, nothing wrong with having a poly family and it obviously works for some but I can't begin to imagine how to address the issue legislatively.

Since we can't define Mathematics within Mathematics, such a Metamaths represents a meta-creating space or awareness/consciousness which envelopes/contains a smaller/less-complex formal system (kind of like a Russian doll).\n\nSo following this logic, either there may be an infinite series of this kind of encapsulation or there's at least one encapsulation which holds the infinite while also remaining part of that infinite.\n\nHis claim regarding the *tools of Creation* had me thinking that such the recursion, inward or outward was infinite, but my position is that it doesn't have to be, as the Id is contained by the Ego and then both are contained within the Super Ego, but the Super Ego may only be infinitie possibility which the Ego then draws and manifests from (like Tesla's infinitie storehouse).\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I can't stop thinking about it!\njsticebeaver: this is the wrong lesson to take from godel's theorems.\n\nwhen viewed in historical context, like many other logicians and mathematicians godel was working on problems that david hilbert had put forth at the turn of the century. hilbert had hoped there could be a single system of proof such that a statement in mathematics was true if and only if it could be proven under that system.\n\nwhat godel did was demonstrate how for any possible system of proof, applied to any possible set of axioms, it was possible to construct a statement which was not provable (derivable by the rules of inference of the system) under that system, but which was intuitively true nonetheless, and provable under a different system (the construction godel follows in his theorem), he basically killed the idea of an absolute method of proof that could attain for us humans absolutely certain mathematical truth.\n\nhilbert's hope for a system of proof that would place mathematical truth in a pedestal of certainty above all other kinds of truth was pretty much given up from then on. you still hear professional mathematicians and popularizers speak of \"mathematical certainty\", but those are people who have not yet learned this lesson.\nGoldenrule-er: Cool. But no thoughts on my actual prompt? I understand you feel it's the \"wrong\" lesson to take from G\u00f6del's work on the Incompleteness Theorems, but say you were open to taking any lessons from anything, what then about what I've postulated in the initial comment? Thanks for you time!\njsticebeaver: I think what you wrote is wrong, but mainly it's not understandable\nGoldenrule-er: Can you share where you cease to follow? Like, where you begin to fail understanding? I might be able to reword/clarify/simplify. \ud83e\udd19\njsticebeaver: first you're speaking of mathematics and systems of deductive proof, then you go to Godel's conclusions about the limits of proof, and then you start a non-sequitor about a metamathematics that's a \"space of awareness\" and so on. I don't know what Godel's theorem has to do with a metamathematics that is a space of awareness\nGoldenrule-er: I see how that could be seen as a non sequitur. I suppose that, since mathematics is our most effective language for describing the world (it survives to describe when other languages fail) that the metamath(s) which can fully define our math(s) would represent a containing source, conceptually speaking. \n\nLike you can't have math if there wasn't also somewhere the thing which allows for it. You can't program in python if the base code didn't allow for the required entry. Maybe that's not the best example, as I'm not a programmer. You can't run \"OregonTrail.exe\" without first having what allows it to exist: the containing system of say MS-DOS. This type of relationship.  Oregon trail.exe cannot operate MS-DOS, but it can be operated within/by MS Dos.\n\nI intended to drive that connection home by referencing the Russian doll and how the id may be said to be contained by the ego and both of these may be contained by the super ego. I suppose I could've been more clear. Thanks for letting me know.\njsticebeaver: I disagree with you, in regards to the what mathematics is I'm a platonist or something. I think there's mathematical objects out there that aren't just thoughts in the minds of mathematicians, or structures present in mathematical languages, but that are objective and have objective features. Mathematics is the study of the necessary features of those objects, but like all studies of objective features of reality, there is no sense in which we can ever achieve complete truth and knowledge, so there isn't a thing such as a mathematics that is perfect and encapsulates our own mathematics. If there is such a thing, it's for the gods to know about, not us.\nGoldenrule-er: You are agreeing with me though. That's why I initially referred to such a *providing Mathematics* as that meta maths would be as the \"tools of Creation\". Your belief in the Ideal cannot be believed in if what we have here isn't a lesser Form of that Ideal. See what I mean, here? You're agreeing that this happens to be the case. Of there are qualitative differences, there must be qualitative levels (Russian doll again [where greater size allows for greater information/detail]). \n\nWho must have the ability to wield a meta mathematics if not meta-level beings? Everything that I've pointed to as far as awareness growing from the id to the ego and (although not for many of us) from the ego to the super ego suggests a processional capability for progressive growth of ability. Not for all, but for those who remain learning selves, anyway. It's not crazy to see such a design unfolding in this manner. What have we done since the digital revolution, but make ever-more realistic virtual spaces and immersive games? As above, so below. My curiosity is in this design as an infinite progression/recursion or instead there being some sort of Max Level. A Super-super ego and so on forever or the super ego as infinite nexus? Any thoughts on this?\njsticebeaver: Here's where I disagree but might seem to agree - that such a being can exist and meaningfully affect the world we live. I don't think this is the case, I think the claim that a supernatural being exists that knows the entirety of mathematics and has absolute knowledge of mathematics, is logically equivalent to a belief in the Greek or Roman gods. It's a form of the belief in supernatural limits to what we can know - supernatural because there are beings that can know beyond that limit, and if they shared it with us we could know it too.\nGoldenrule-er: I hear what you're saying and agree with you as far as it appears exactly the same as Greek or Roman beliefs in various patron gods of song and dance or the sea or fertility etc. Today we'd consider such beliefs as passing and nonsense. \n\nToday also, however, we design virtual worlds where people immerse their psyches and entertain the willing suspension of disbelief. Just because a programmer knows and writes in a language of which I know nothing about doesn't change the fact that I can treat what's before my eyes in a virtual reality simulation as real to me in that moment. This is the point I'm speaking to. The same relationship would apply to knowledge of a meta mathematics. \n\nThat programmer is levels above me in knowledge of a particular area, so by extension it's not unfeasible to believe that there are such levels of *capability* for learning, maintaining and employing levels of knowledge. \n\nWe have Holy books from the times of the Greeks and Romans that speak directly to godly design employment and communication from a meta level. Our oldest traditions such as Hinduism speak directly to a panpsychist design of our known reality which suggests the very same truth as our own individual progressing from id to ego to super ego: that for the psyche, there are varying levels of awareness of the same thing and varying levels of awareness may incorporate corresponding levels of ability to exercise   such awareness. \n\nWe see this is the various forms of mastery we see today in our daily life. NHL goalies have superhuman response times-- through familiarity and practice. People who practice a specialty better and more than others achieve greater levels of ability in such specialties. Whether a \"Rock God\" guitarist or a Olympic gymnast or a Hollywood Director, these show levels of achievement aren't limited as we continue to set new records in all of these areas within this space. \n\nMaths limit our ability to perform such feats within this space, but our own ability to outperform previous limits shows a mind component that could connect to limitless expansion toward Plato's World of Forms in the following way:\n\n There may be infinite numbers/values between 0 and 1. Perhaps 1 is that WoFs and they design everything between 0 and 1 as an encapsulated space designed-experientially in mathematics, for our experience, from the WoFs space of Meta-maths. Sure it's a long shot, but it does correspond to how we design and initiate encapsulated systems here, so it may not, in truth, be so nonsensical at all. \n\nThanks for your time, I know this was long.\njsticebeaver: &gt; The same relationship would apply to knowledge of a meta mathematics. \n\nNo, because a programmer programs a computer, which is a physical object, and the knowledge required to do that is conjectured explanations - not the kind of perfect knowledge the entity you posit possesses.\nGoldenrule-er: That is correct. I am attempting to show the physical relationship we have to define a virtual/perceptual/experiential space performs the same functional-relationship as a metaphysical to physical interactional/programming/design relationship might.  \n\nSomeone who is pure id cannot access the knowledge of the self awareness of the ego. Someone enslaved by their ego cannot know the experience of one who has risen above the tyranny of the ego and so has come to employ the ego for its own purposes. \n\nUnderstanding that the limitations of the beings we posit/embody may shift and change in such fashions as we incorporate greater forms of knowledge/learning is intended to portray the same functional-relationship a meta being would have with meta maths in comparison to our human being with *regular/standard maths*. \n\nThe id cannot comprehend the ego. The ego comprehends (encapsulates) the I'd, and may entertain the idea of the superego, but cannot comprehend (encapsulate) the super ego. The transcendence of these boundaries is made by the psyche. If we can go up in awareness and design for lesser levels of awareness (the influence or creation for egos and ids for example), why would it seem spurious that *they/meta beings* could not be doing the same for us?\n\nI realize that it's only obvious that we'd suggest our idea of any *higher plain of experience* must reflect that of what the design we inhabit suggests to us, but it does stand to reason, doesn't it?\n\nAlso, the computer is a physical object, but the information it operates with and shows upon the screen is *virtual* or conceptual. The rules and syntax of computer language is programmed systems that output information by the input of information. The abacus is physical, the digital computer works with physical transfers of electrons in the form of electricity to yield electronic outputs we then *virtually* read as a translation of physical input for *experiential value/virtual output* The one or zero of binary is *seen* as a physical \"one of zero\", but only in that a screen *displays* a one or a zero. We have not yet determined a physical nature for information (and may one day understand information as metaphysical [that part of the formal system which cannot be fully defined with that system, as G\u00f6del has shown us with the Incompleteness Theorems]).\njsticebeaver: First of all I just want to make clear that our knowledge of mathematics evolves. Mathematicians today know theorems and are able to produce proofs that mathematicians just 200 years ago didn't know how to. They understand what a proof is, what criteria proofs must meet to be accepted by the community, better than mathematicians did before. More than that, some things mathematicians thought before, are now known to be mistaken (case in point the universal system of proof that Godel showed was impossible).\n\nSo mathematics isn't what mathematicians think is true about numbers and sets and so on. Mathematicians have no authority over what mathematics is, they are just the people that in any given culture, generations and so on study mathematics. When the beliefs of mathematicians change regarding what's true and what is not in mathematics, those changes carry no authority and the matter of the truth or falsity of those beliefs remains unchanged, it's an objective property independent of who holds the beliefs, be it a studied professor or a graduate student.\n\nIt's not like you can define mathematics as the body of beliefs about numbers that mathematicians have, and then you define a superset of that which is comprised of all the abstract real true beliefs about numbers that only a supernatural being could have and be aware of.\nGoldenrule-er: I believe I hear you. This is indeed a topic regarding the philosophy of Mathematics rather than Mathematics itself. Of course beliefs don't change the happenstance of veracity or falsehood regarding proofs etc. No one is claiming such a super set as a *true belief*. I'm trying to say that G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems appear to point to the necessity of such an enveloping/containing source-- as no formal system may be completely defined within its own system. It appears to be the case if his proofs are proofs, right? Unless maybe it's just pure intuitional pulling from the infinite (as we have with all creative endeavors which have come from ideas).\n\nSo it would appear that Mathematics itself/physics itself, having no findable foundations as proven by G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems, also means there are no findable foundations *without the introduction of a meta-maths*. If this were to be true (and it may indeed be impossible to know this unless perhaps in dreamspace or something of the like) then such a meta-maths would literally represent \"the tools of Creation\". That the meta-maths contains or Martha would then make any user/programmer/metamathematician supernatural, in the true sense of the word, *to us*. \n\nSo what I trying to say here? No trouble with truth and falsity, only a logical playout. It is also always possible there is an entirely separate factual/actual logical playout(s) for which we have not accessed any knowledge of yet whatsoever, but it happens to be the case and always has been since our maths were discovered/created within the metamaths. \n\nThat said, I also like the bottom up idea where we make the higher forms from the lesser. As in the case of binary birthing so many forms of evolved programming languages, yet this route is moot given that zero and one fall within our accessible maths and so the metamaths provider becomes necessary once again as the Incompleteness Theorems appear to call for a meta-maths as necessary, you know?\njsticebeaver: &gt; No one is claiming such a super set as a true belief. I'm trying to say that G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems appear to point to the necessity of such an enveloping/containing source\n\nNo, the exact opposite is true, Godel's construction shows that such an enveloping/containing source is impossible. Godel doesn't show or suggest what the nature of mathematics is, instead he proves that the nature of mathematics IS NOT that there exists an all enveloping container which holds all mathematical systems that cannot by themselves be consistent and complete.\n\nHe shows there cannot be such a necessity as an enveloping source for all mathematics known to man. That source was believed to be necessary before Godel's work, and Godel became iconic for showing that intuition was false, and that not only there was no such necessity, but that there couldn't possibly be.\n\n&gt; So it would appear that Mathematics itself/physics itself, having no findable foundations as proven by G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems, also means there are no findable foundations without the introduction of a meta-maths. If this were to be true (and it may indeed be impossible to know this unless perhaps in dreamspace or something of the like) then such a meta-maths would literally represent \"the tools of Creation\". That the meta-maths contains or Martha would then make any user/programmer/metamathematician supernatural, in the true sense of the word, to us. \n\nThis meta-maths doesn't exist. Show me an example of it. For example, I could show you Godel's theorem and it would be an example of mathematics as we know it. But you couldn't show me an example of that meta-maths, because it doesn't exist. If it did exist, then you could show me. But you can't.\nGoldenrule-er: On the first point you've just basically misunderstood the ramifications of the Incompleteness Theorems and there nothing In aware of that I can do to help you with that here.\n\nOn the second point you're fundamentally missing out on the fact that such a metamaths cannot be shown *here*. In effect, you're saying \"if the whole world exists outside of my house how come you can't prove it by bringing it inside my house?\" The world cannot fit in your house. Your house is dependant on the whole world, not the other way around.\njsticebeaver: I have not. You're making a baseless speculation in my eyes, where you are attempting to save the pre-Godelian idea that mathematics can be put on a solid foundation from which all mathematical truths can be deduced, an all containing source. Godel showed this idea was mistaken. Upon Godel's refutation of this idea, you are reimagining the kind of secure source of all mathematics in a way that maybe his predecessor hadn't thought of, but you are still making the same mistake that Godel unveiled.\nGoldenrule-er: Thank you for clarifying. What I'm trying to communicate is that what G\u00f6del unveiled is that it's impossible to *bring the world into the house* so there's indeed no finding or bringing such Metamechanics here as they do not write in a language which may be shown in our programming language (regular/*our* maths) so to speak. Given he showed there's always a backdoor to a larger system which then fully defines the smaller system, so it it is that he's not proving that the meta-maths don't exist, but that they cannot exist here. Just as physics may show us the conceptual understandings of 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on dimensions, so can this suggestion/logical-deduction be entertained/imagined as a possibility realizable *somewhere else* while also not being realized within *our* shared space.\njsticebeaver: I don't think it can, not in the sense of it being a problem of understanding that you can make progress in, since by definition that thing is not realized in our physical reality, where only a small proportion of all mathematical truths can be understood and known by us.\n\nBy your explanation, any kind of variant of a metamechanics as the one you have in mind is \"impossible to bring the world into the house\", and that \"there is indeed no finding or bringing such Metamechanics here\". The case for us coming to know and understand a Methamechanics of this kind is a case of a proposition which we do know can never be known, by any means, as long as we're humans in the physical world, which you agree is the case.\n\nSo all ideas of what that thing is, all arguments made about that thing and why it matters, including yours, all those would be arbitrary and eventually uninteresting to the people involved. To the point, nowadays that's out of fashion. It was in fashion maybe up until Bertrand Russel.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also true that the mathematics we know today is going to look like kid play for people in thousands of years, but that advance will not be made in a single discovery, it will happen gradually as people conquer more paroquial problems, and from solving some of those, answers with larger reach will shape the growth of knowledge. For us to understand that it would be like if some of the earliest homo sapiens to have ever existed somehow appeared fully conscious and alive in Times Square this afternoon. They would be left without comprehension and wouldn't be able to understand what they were seeing and experiencing.\n", "prompt": "BernardJOrtcutt: /r/philosophy Open Discussion Thread | March 21, 2022\nWelcome to this week's Open Discussion Thread.

{"full_text": "akosgi: Truth be told: You probably have ego problems.\nYep, even you.\n\nA common misconception is that having a big ego is reserved for people who think highly of themselves. Sure, they have big egos, but believe it or not, your self-loathing-ass probably does too.\n\nThe concept I'm trying to convey here is when you fill your own head with thoughts of yourself constantly, be them negative or positive, it all constitutes a big ego. Over time, you create this self-image that you become tied to, and thus, it becomes fragile. And, due to this big fragile ego, you refuse to take the actions necessary to get outcomes you desire, because your head is so over-inflated with thoughts of yourself that you aren't giving your thought space the necessary room to interact with and understand the rest of the world. Your subconscious is terrified of anything that can challenge this fragile ego, and so you freak out at the thought of stepping outside your comfort zone and putting yourself out there.\n\nCouple points:\n\n- You're not that important. The only person thinking so much about you is YOU. And the more you think about yourself and how you suck at social skills, are ugly, are afraid of rejection, are this/that, the less you can think about the people around you who you actually WANT to interact with. (disclaimer: because I know some pedant in the comments is gonna bring this up: this isn't targeting those who genuinely DON'T want to interact with others. But seriously, why are y'all on /r/socialskills if your goal isn't to interact with others?)\n\n- When you switch your perspective to learning about and understanding the people and world around you - even in ways that it doesn't affect you - you'll see a profound change in the way you exist. Sure, you'll get rejected. But you'll realize that *it doesn't fucking matter.* You're not so important that this rejection is the end of some great value you brought to the table. \n\n- Approach the world seeking to learn from it and contribute to it. If you have nothing to contribute, learn. If you have nothing to learn, contribute. If you have both, do both.\n\n**TLDR:** The long and short of it is that the more you think about yourself, whether it's good or bad thoughts, the less you're thinking about others and the world around you. I hope this helps some people get over social hurdles that they constructed themselves.\n\n*edit:* Wanted to add a section about actually changing these things. Whenever I feel like something is \"easier said than done,\" or \"hard bc I've been this way all along,\" I call upon a very simple concept: discipline. As I stated in a comment, discipline is doing something that sucks, but you know is good for you, even when you don't want to. And \"not having discipline\" is a cop-out, since it literally is just doing things when you don't want to. There is no great chasm between zero and one. Do or do not, there is no try. You'll never get it if you don't start it, and you'll never have it if you don't keep at it. So discipline yourself to stop your spiraling negative thought processes - meditate, learn to harness your mind and stop letting negative thoughts fill your head. Discipline yourself to go to the gym even when you're tired as shit. Discipline yourself to go and talk to the person you're nervous to talk to, even when you don't want to. Just do it. There's no rocket science here, it's just a matter of doing until it becomes habit. Good luck!\nSunkenStone: I've seen this concept of 'the self-loathing are actually secret narcissists' increasingly frequently, and, since you seem to have bought into it hard, you're as good a person as any to ask: What good comes from this framing? Is it intended to spur the self-loathing into action by adding another item to their list of flaws? Is its purpose to justify those who reject the self-loathing by saying, 'It's okay, they were a narcissist anyway.' Who benefits?\nakosgi: The point is this ego discussion is a starting point from which the rest of their self-declared \"flaws\" will stem from - and addressing it makes things simpler. But they have to want to change, of course. And that goes back to ego.\n\nIdeally, everyone benefits. They get over themselves, they get over their self-loathing, and everyone they interact with enjoys their company, and it becomes a positive feedback loop of life.\nSunkenStone: &gt; The point is this ego discussion is a starting point from which the rest of their self-declared \"flaws\" will stem from\n\nWhat do you mean by this? That the idea is to make 'you have a massive ego' the central flaw in a self-loathing person's mind? You state the ideal outcomes, but none of them rely on this specific framing being at the root of things.\nakosgi: You're greatly simplifying what I'm saying to fit your narrative against my theme.\n\nThe point is, the more time and mind space you waste on thinking about yourself, the less time and mind space you have on learning and growing from the world around you. When you enter social interactions, you want to have a growth and contribution mentality to see things through. For many, it requires understanding that when they're spending so much time thinking about themselves, it's an ego problem, and this initiates a different train of thought than their status quo.\n\nIt's a pedant's exercise to look at a single element of the overall message and attempt to completely discredit the value around it. I wrote another post specifically for pedants that do this:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/iydnj9/protip_not_everyone_will_say_things_exactly_how/\n\nAnd as an aside, if you're not seeing the amount of responses that have said this has actually helped them think differently about the way they are and it's working for them, then that's on you.\nSunkenStone: When your initial post is so nebulous, it makes sense to want to \"simplify\" it to something concrete so it can be parsed properly. I have no problem with this:\n\n&gt;  The more time and mind space you waste on thinking about yourself, the less time and mind space you have on learning and growing from the world around you. When you enter social interactions, you want to have a growth and contribution mentality to see things through.\n\nI do have a problem with this:\n\n&gt; For many, it requires understanding that when they're spending so much time thinking about themselves, it's an ego problem, and this initiates a different train of thought than their status quo.\n\nThe way you originally phrased this in your OP was indistinguishable from a description of narcissism. True narcissists, people with NPD, are commonly understood to be unfixable, fundamentally flawed people. [This comic](https://old.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/rbuw44/truth_be_told_you_probably_have_ego_problems/hnsr3qd/), which you responded positively to, shows the much more likely outcome of telling a self-loathing person that they're actually incredibly vain. It doesn't spur them to action, it creates another layer of paralyzing shame.\n\nYou seem partial to calling people pedants, both in this comment section and in the past. Isn't that a bit hypocritical coming from you? Shouldn't these people who are getting flack for phrasing their advice in frankly abusive ways (or \"behind a wall of negativity\" as you would put it) just discipline themselves and make their messaging more palatable? Especially when the unpleasant bits are unnecessary for getting the theme across. Or does discipline only apply to one's self and you can't call on other people to practice it? I get that in a \"I can only control my actions and my reaction to the world and I have to make the best of that\" way, but this specific instance does have a bit of doormat energy.\n\nWith regards to your aside, I'm not responding here because I have some abstract notion that this could hypothetically be bad. When I was a lot less stable, things like your first two paragraphs in the OP and the comic linked above were directly and severely harmful to my mental well-being. I don't deny that it helps some people. I just have doubts that the number of people it helps and the degree to which it helps them outweighs the number of people it harms and the degree to which it harms them. That's why I bothered commenting in the first place; I just don't see how this could help more people than it hurts.\nakosgi: Alright, I got time today.\n\nPoint 1:\n\n&gt;The way you originally phrased this in your OP was indistinguishable from a description of narcissism.\n\nThis is a straw man of my discussion, and then an attack on that straw man. I have not claimed them to be narcissists, and am therefore not saying they are unfixable, fundamentally flawed people. Then again, I was never outright accused of the narcissists stuff, so there is plausible deniability to claim that's not what was being insinuated. But one can infer.\n\nPoint 2:\n\n&gt;This comic, which you responded positively to, shows the much more likely outcome of telling a self-loathing person that they're actually incredibly vain. It doesn't spur them to action, it creates another layer of paralyzing shame.\n\nThis is not how I interpreted this comic. I read it as this person found it so profound that they are actually taking the time to process it. Interpretations differ.\n\nPoint 3:\n\n&gt;Shouldn't these people who are getting flack for phrasing their advice in frankly abusive ways (or \"behind a wall of negativity\" as you would put it) just discipline themselves and make their messaging more palatable? \n\nOf course. But then, shortly thereafter,\n\n&gt;I get that in a \"I can only control my actions and my reaction to the world and I have to make the best of that\" way\n\nSo the solution was basically discussed immediately. And then finally, this thought is ended with \n\n&gt;this specific instance does have a bit of doormat energy.\n\nwhich is, again, a personal interpretation of this. Taking it with such a negative connotation is exactly against the prior citation that I made.\n\nPoint 4:\n\n&gt;I'm not responding here because I have some abstract notion that this could hypothetically be bad\n\nBut then,\n\n&gt;things like your first two paragraphs in the OP and the comic linked above were directly and severely harmful to my mental well-being\n\nThese two sentences conflict with each other. \n\n&gt;I just have doubts that the number of people it helps and the degree to which it helps them outweighs the number of people it harms and the degree to which it harms them\n\nThe overall popularity of this post begs to differ. But also, that statement is in direct contraction with\n\n&gt;I'm not responding here because I have some abstract notion that this could hypothetically be bad.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm unsure as to what the point of all this is.\n\nedited for format\nSunkenStone: To clarify, I am explicitly saying that you have portrayed the self-loathing as narcissists. I don't think you need to say it directly in order to have done so, either. If I described someone as, \"having a head so over-inflated with thoughts of themselves that they aren't giving their thought space the necessary room to interact with and understand the rest of the world; their subconscious is terrified of anything that can challenge this fragile ego,\" I would be describing a narcissist. The unfixable, fundamentally flawed part follows from this. If you can't see why I think this implication exists, I thank you for reading but I don't think we'll be able to come to any sort of resolution.\n\nMy point about controlling your own actions goes along with \"does discipline only apply to one's self and you can't call on other people to practice it\". I'm saying that asking people to tolerate the \"wall of negativity\" in order to find the sections of good advice when the advice giver could have simply not put the negativity in, effectively demanding discipline from one's self while not requiring it of others, is doormat-like.\n\nMy last paragraph is not contradictory. I'm saying that I'm not someone merely theorizing that this could hurt people. I know for a fact that it can because things near identical to it did hurt me in the past. Furthermore, because I know it can hurt people, that makes me question whether or not this helps more people than it hurts.\n\nMy overall point is that telling people that if they hate themselves it's actually a sign that they're a terrible person is reckless, and that this implication didn't need to be in your post at all to make it effective. Changing the faux tough love title to something else and just including everything from \"Couple points\" to the end would result in a post with the same impact, from my point of view. For the record I'm not trying to get you to change your post because you're right that it drew a lot of engagement.\nakosgi: Point 1:\n\n&gt;To clarify, I am explicitly saying that you have portrayed the self-loathing as narcissists.\n\nAlright, I appreciate you clarifying. Thanks to this, saying \n\n&gt;The unfixable, fundamentally flawed part follows from this.\n\nIs textbook straw man fallacy - you are purposely misrepresenting my argument (and then applying extraneous characteristics to my argument) in order to present an attack. If anything, I spend copious amounts of effort on this sub attempting to help people change and grow themselves, because I don't believe they are fundamentally flawed or unfixable. You're right, we won't come to resolution here because your interpretation is not fact, so stop presenting it like it is.\n\nPoint 2:\n\n&gt;\"does discipline only apply to one's self and you can't call on other people to practice it\".\n\nYou cannot discipline someone else. You can suggest discipline but not force them to act differently.\n\n&gt;effectively demanding discipline from one's self while not requiring it of others, is doormat-like.\n\nAgain, you keep spewing this interpretation as if I'm supposed to agree. It's not fact. And what's worse is that you have stated before: \n\n&gt;\"I can only control my actions and my reaction to the world and I have to make the best of that\"\n\nSo you clearly understand the constructive theme that I'm attempting to convey, but are actively ignoring it for the sake of argument.\n\nPoint 3:\n\n&gt;telling people that if they hate themselves it's actually a sign that they're a terrible person\n\nThis is not what I've done, but again, you seem to be very loose with your interpretations of my words.\n\nPoint 4:\n\n&gt;Changing the faux tough love title to something else and just including everything from \"Couple points\" to the end would result in a post with the same impact, from my point of view.\n\nIf all this detracted so much, then the post, its current state, wouldn't have received such a positive response.\n\nPoint 5:\n\n&gt;For the record I'm not trying to get you to change your post because you're right that it drew a lot of engagement.\n\nThis is an outright lie. You can't spend an entire post attempting to disassemble my post then end it with this sentence as a CYA. \n\nPoint 6:\n\nIf your overall focus was \n\n&gt;I just have doubts that the number of people it helps and the degree to which it helps them outweighs the number of people it harms and the degree to which it harms them.\n\nThen it shows how shoddy an argument you're making, due to how you've been actively seeking to spin everything in the most disgusting, incendiary, and vicious interpretations possible. I'll admit that some of it is blunt, but when someone actively misinterprets and misrepresents a statement to twist what's been said, misses the actionable advice and resolutions, and then harms themselves (either physically or mentally) because of their twisted interpretation, that's out of anyone's control but that person. \n\nSummary:\n\nI'm sorry that you're doing this and have a thought space where you feel the need to do this, and do hope you, or anyone you're speaking for, can heal and be better.\nSunkenStone: I'm not going to dignify a comment that ends with a \"who hurt you sweatie\"-type remark with a real response, and I'm exceedingly glad I refrained from mentioning the exact nature of the harm I experienced.

Thank you =]\n[deleted]: Are you suggesting using someone who is constantly being proven wrong to come up with something so people who routinely prove this same person as wrong would try to prove him wrong by thinking and studying diverse topics for a 'comeback' of the subject?\n\nJust trying to assert if I got this right.\nsablejouster: Yep... At least it would speed up the process by a fraction.\r\nSo do you want to adopt a phrase?\n[deleted]: I see no problem with doing it, could you provide me one or do I have to think about it?\n\nIf I have to think about it it would a part of the plan at work and you would actually be misleading by doing exactly what you're saying, but doing something else for it.\n\nWhich would be quite an intelligent act to make people study and think about something that cannot be proved to be wrong, thus increasing the overall knowledge. But it does have its set backs if the person you're talking to make use of situation analysis and/or is experienced with analyzing a situation on wich the person itself is part of.\n\nAnd by trying to understand determinism(cause and effect) I have done something like this for quite a awhile.\n\nBut if you provide me a phrase, sure, if not, meh I'm out.\nsablejouster: Ok, try this one: We can't live forever can we? \r\nSomething simple, slightly negative and widely known...\n[deleted]: Actually I wish you'd gave me a phrase where I would need to think rather than one someone else would.\nsablejouster: One of my favs: Without order nothing can exist - without chaos nothing can evolve.\n[deleted]: If I come in contact with a materialist he'd argue that 'order' and 'chaos' do not exist, both are just perceptions.\n\nYou could argue that order is the rule of determinism, but if chaos does not exist, how can you tell if its really order?\nsablejouster: Chaos is also a mathematical theory... it could be proved to exist...\r\nThat phrase links to this \"apparent\" biology, as you know, has an order eg. cells, tissues, organ,system. Order or not, this is followed everywhere so it cannot be chaos... but then chaos deals with probability so chances of chaos occurring in repetition could be the same reason this planet is unique... \r\n\r\nBack to point: this phrase could be pulled to idea generation also, then ideas aren't necessarily matter so you could pull this conversation as much as you want... You don't know about order or chaos because as there is no such thing as Always right or wrong... \n[deleted]: There is a utterly high probability of me not knowing the correct definition of chaos.\n\nCould you elaborate to me?\nsablejouster: You probably know Chaos better than me...\r\nI probably referring to the end products of the butterfly effect (eg. humans)... that effect says that one small change can cause drastic changes in the end product, quite simple, but think about what it would take to reach the same end product again... so the universe could be taken as infinite probability (assuming we are atheists), so here order would help 'restore the balance' in order to get repetition of improbable products... thus hopefully showing the importance of order... \r\n\r\nI am also limited by my own knowledge so I'll look like a fool trying to explain my view of the world to someone else!\n[deleted]: Ahhh Chaos Theory, I am aware of it, but even tho its called chaos theory its not because its 'chaotic' in the sense that it _is_ random, it's called chaos because placed in reality, we can't know for sure how its gonna end, even if there is a definite non random way it work, we can't know because we don't know how to mesure or even if we can mesure, but the order exist in the same way.\n\nWe're talking about the same thing, just in different levels of abstraction.\n\nWhich would be a problem if I end up talking to someone that thinks similar to me heh\nsablejouster: Haha I agree with ya... the idea of placing it in reality is a very intriguing one. I have a hard time defining what reality is.\r\n\r\nSo you are not a materialist so (could I know the opposite of it? not idealism, that is too extreme... can't Google it anywhere...)\n[deleted]: Actually, I don't know yet or even if I can define me, I used to think that I was an atheist, but that held only one information, then I went with determinist, which took base on my atheism, but then it wasn't enough since determinism is just a way to show how our reality works, it doesn't say anything else, just HOW it works by cause and effect.\n\nSo if determinism is just the way reality works, I though that it wasn't suitable to call myself a determinist, at least not for my own unknown purpose.\n\nFrom that, coupled with my previous attempts of looking for meaning by understanding/imagining/confabulating the universe, I reached nihilism. Now I though I was onto something, until I realized that I was wrong on a level that I couldn't see before:\n\n1st, I can't objectively say that a higher purpose doesn't exist, I can only state that I'm unaware of it.\n\n2nd, \"Nothing matters\" is fundamentally wrong as in if reality works through cause and effect, the right thing to take from that would be that everything matter, nihilism was a wrong understanding from reality. Nihilism only talks about ultimate lack of purpose, which I don't know if there is something or not, so I can't say there isn't the same way I can't say there is. Its the agnostic approach actually, \"I don't know\".\n\nSo nihilism wasn't something that fitted an accurate definition of me, and so I went 'deeper'\n\nBy understanding cause and effect (determinism) and taking an agnostic approach to things I had no information about, materialism arose.\n\nSo materialism had to be it right? Well, kinda. I won't say that I AM materialist, but I'm ok with saying that materialism is all I can be right now. And unless I acquire information that would go against said philosophy, I'll remain materialist because I can't see any other way so far.\n\nIf I can objectively say something about myself, it would be that I'm trying to understand how it all works, the whys and the whats. Materialism is the higher I could achieve for now, I didn't get there by reading about materialism, I read about materialism after looking for a way to describe what I though was going on.\n\nSo I'm not a materialist, I'm always changing.\nsablejouster: Wow I wish I had a deeper understanding of myself like you (though the journey is never ending) ...\r\n\r\nFrom all you have told me I believe you have an open mind, as Internet states open mindedness is one of the main attributes towards agnosticism... try reading about agnostic materialist.. just for a bit of classification.\r\n\r\nI just want to know this... do you want to find god yet cannot find means? Despising the idea of god as then fatalism could occur? or Don't care about god as he/she/it has no actual effect in your life...\r\n\r\nknowing that really helped me position myself on my views.\n[deleted]: I'm glad you liked my attempt of explanation :P\n\nWell, to be honest I don't know why I search, I'm not looking for a purpose of things, I'm looking to understand things, I do have wishful thinking but I try to stay away from it as it could cloud my perceptions.\n\nI have no purpose for understanding either, I just like to understand, you could keep me happy for eternity if I could never reach reach the ultimate understanding of everything, but at the same time, I could keep understanding more and more.\n\nI like to understand things, its not the purpose that I look, deep down, I like to understand.\n\nBut if you ask me why I like to understand, I'd have to tell you that I have no idea. (yet heh)\nsablejouster: Glad to see that there are open minded people... as most people I know have definite attitudes and usually try to stuff it down people's throats, those people I just don't understand...\r\n\r\nI doubt why you will know, the fact that you will learn, to understand, what which you cannot figure out.

The only reason we bought anything at one was gift cards. Otherwise, you can get everything baby-related at a Target or on Amazon. \n\nOh, and cribs? If you can, buy that on CL. I know it might sound icky, but the mattresses themselves are cheap, and the cribs (assuming they're the painted and lacquered kind) are extremely save to bring home and just spray down with a cleaner. We got a crib AND dresser set for less than the cost of one dresser. \n\nOf course new is great too, though! But even then, Babies R Us furniture prices were pretty high-- in between Target and Pottery Barn in some things.\nClypsedra: That\u2019s good to know - makes me feel better on missing out. I\u2019m glad to have Target nearby and I definitely plan on getting my stroller and stuff there. Not even sure if we are gonna do a proper crib yet but thanks for the tip, I\u2019ll keep that in mind! I\u2019ve heard Facebook marketplace is taking off too and is a good place for that sort of stuff. An ikea opened in my state finally too, I\u2019m planning on checking it out for some cabinets and I heard they have good cribs there too! \nExoticCommunication: A few thoughts, unasked, provided anyway because nobody told me this shit when I was waiting on my first...\n\n1. You may not think it, but lighter strollers ARE really nice. We have the Britax B-Agile. It's nice, robust, and the stroller is easy to push around. But it IS heavy. And that starts to get tiring when you're folding it up a bunch at restaurants or to lift it into a trunk. On the other hand, our little one would sleep like a log in the baby car seat (which detaches and attaches to the base perfectly every time). (Target has the B-Agile, just FYI.)\nOne thing I'd recommend is going to the store and pushing around a bunch of the strollers on display with a 10 lbs weight in the seat. Get a sense of how your arms like the feel of it. You will be pushing this thing around every day for years. You need to like how it feels. \nAlso: wait on one of the Target \"Spend $100 get $15 off\" sales or whatever. And then use your red card on top of that. You get an instant 5-10%+ off.\n\n2. You will want/need a proper crib at some point. Once the kid gains some degree of mobility (usually around 4-6 months) you need to ensure they're kept cooped up at night. Babies are great at self-harm. Don't let them. \n2a. Don't co-sleep if you ever want a sex life again. Nobody whom I know who does it has a sex life. \n\n3. IKEA has some solid options, but IIRC their mattress sizes are a bit non-standard. We have one of their toddler beds, and it's pretty nice. Also, if you find one with missing hardware: TAKE IT ANYWAY. I learned this the hard way with my daughter's bed. A coworker gave it to me, I lost the dowels and bolts and stuff and IKEA just mailed me replacement parts. Don't let a missing flange or whatever hold you back on used IKEA stuff!\n\n4. Before you buy a breast pump, ask your health insurance if they cover them! Lots do, and that's $200-300 saved! \nClypsedra: Wow thanks for the advice, I appreciate it. I\u2019ve pushed around a few strollers at target but I was more focused on how heavy the matching car seat was, not the stroller. Good tip. I like the chicco strollers but I think they are on the heavier side. I was wondering how to knock some damage off the $380 price tag, so I appreciate the sales knowledge.\n\nYeah....maybe you\u2019re right on the crib. I know I can\u2019t keep him in a bassinet for long. Also terrified of killing him in any form of cosleeping due to my ridiculous blanket habits, so that\u2019s already a no go. I have past baby experience thanks to my mom who had kids majorly spread out. Took a lot of care of my brother who is 14 years younger than me. My parents kept him in a pack n play because he\u2019d climb out of his crib and crash to the floor, then wander around the house crying. I was hoping to get away with a pack n play too...but that only lasts for so long, then what? I have a 1 year old too big for his bed. Maybe I\u2019ll put off buying a crib and see how it goes, but keep and open mind.\n\nIs a fancy electric breast pump worth the trouble? I plan on being home with the kid breastfeeding and supplementing formula, so I have not thought I need a breast pump mostly because I haven\u2019t had enough time to accept the idea of pumping. I was planning on getting a cheap manual one just in case. \nExoticCommunication: Ah, if you stay home you may not need to, but if the insurance company provides you a pump for free, why not? Plus, if you need to take a trip without the kiddo (it happens!) or you get a plugged duct while baby is sleeping (it happens!) you may want the pump to help out. \n\nWe did a bassinet for the first, err... 3 months, 4 months? Eventually though they'll get too big for even a bigger bassinet. I think ours outgrew hers at around 6 months. The pack and plays are okay, but oh boy are they low to the floor (being... on the floor and all...) Maybe look at the convertible bed-crib things? 2 things in one go!\n\nAnd yeah, wait for Target baby stuff sales.

A followup question I have is why are you trying to date? People have lots of reasons, and it\u2019s good to hear yours specifically.\n[deleted]: Well I\u2019m going to be honest. One of the reasons if because I really want to get intimate with a woman, so essentially sex.\nBotAtHackEr: No worries, that\u2019s a legit reason. It\u2019s tricky though, because when I hear people say they want sex, there are 2 main camps I see people fall into.\n\nThe first are people who want sex and nothing more, so a prostitute would fix their problem. The biggest barrier is money and access, so the conversation turns to that.\n\nThe second camp are people who wouldn\u2019t be happy going to a prostitute, because they want a genuine connection with the woman they\u2019re having sex with. I find that in a lot of these conversations, the desire for sex is a proxy for the desire to be desired.\n\nWhich of these two camps feels closer to where you are in your situation?\n[deleted]: The second camp definitely\nBotAtHackEr: Ah, got it, so it sounds like, in addition to sex, having a girlfriend is also about feeling desired. If it\u2019s the second camp, my guess it\u2019s not just sexual desire either, but more of a general \u201cI want someone who cares about me.\u201d Is that more or less accurate?\n[deleted]: Yes\nBotAtHackEr: Hm if that\u2019s the case, then the first thing I end up thinking about is, what are other ways to get what you want, i.e. someone who cares about you? I think a girlfriend can be that person, but I also feel like friends can also fill that role. \n\nObviously friends can\u2019t provide sex, so there\u2019s that caveat. But I feel like having a friend who cares about you is pretty similar to having a girlfriend who cares about you. What are the biggest differences for you?\n[deleted]: The biggest difference is definitely sex. But also the intimacy really\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, sex is a big one. What do you mean by intimacy, like physical? Emotional?\n[deleted]: Both\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, being physically intimate with friends isn\u2019t really an option for a lot of people. Emotionally though, it might be comparable.\n\nWhat would it look like to be emotionally intimate with someone? Is that something you could try with a friend?\n[deleted]: Well I guess I could be emotionally intimate with a friend. Although for me it would be liking me for who I am really.\nBotAtHackEr: That\u2019s a reasonable thing to want, and I feel like a friend, a good one at least, should like you for who you are. It\u2019d be a red flag if they didn\u2019t. Do you feel like you have someone who likes for you who you are, friend or not?\n[deleted]: I do have family, but no friends.\nBotAtHackEr: Ah, that would make things difficult, and it makes more sense to me now why intimacy is important to you.\n\nMy first thought is that it might help more to focus on making friends right now. For me, girlfriends are a subsection of friends, meaning if finding friends is hard, then finding a girlfriend will be even harder. I\u2019ve met people who were great friends but terrible as SOs. I\u2019ve never met anyone who was a great SO but a bad friend.\n\nI do believe that if you meet a friend who cares about you, then you\u2019ll feel a lot happier and readier to look for a girlfriend.\n", "prompt": "[deleted]: How to stop being an incel?\n\nBotAtHackEr: One good first step is to ask yourself why you believe you\u2019re an incel.\n\nAre you single and trying to date?

It has no computers, no cell phones, no televisions, no air conditioning.\n\nWhy do you believe that they ought to have luxury? Has luxury made westerners happy or just comfortable and sedated?\n\nWhilst you say they have no luxury, they might criticize westerners of leading meaningless and shallow lives. \n\nIt's important to realize that **we are only techonologically superior**. We are not necessarily happier than them nor do we feel more nourished and valued.\n\nThey do not worry about stock market crashes, ISIS is not problem, they don't have school shootings. Their lives are a balance of work, family, religion, and whatever recreational activities (music, art, dance, etc.) they have.\n\nThey are truly a community. I'm sure conflict exists and they have their fights. But they're no doubt tight knit. Is it right for us to take that away from them?\nbioemerl: &gt; Why do you believe that they ought to have luxury?\n\nBecause I am a fan of a society that provides goods and services to all people, and uses all the human resources available to it to the benefit of us all.\n\n&gt;Has luxury made westerners happy or just comfortable and sedated?\n\nThe state of human existance is to never be happy with what you have, to always want more, and so on.\n\nWesterners live lives that are longer, spent less in pain, safer, more productive, and better in just about every way.  All cultural aspects of a happy and low-lived life are also things that exist in western culture, we aren't preserving some \"better way of existence\" by keeping these natives around.  \n\nThe Amish do just fine while being in contact with the rest of the world.  It's their choice to do as they want, and these natives need to have that choice as well.\n\n&gt;they might criticize westerners of leading meaningless and shallow lives. \n\nLife has no meaning at all.  It doesn't matter who you are, or what you accomplish, it all is meaningless in the end.  The most you can do is live how you want.\n\nAnd by denying these people contact, we deny them the right to live as they want, but instead they live as we choose to force them to.\n\nImagine we leave the starving on our streets, saying we need to preserve homeless culture.  It would be unacceptable.  This is hardly different in my opinion.\n\n\nEpicureanist: Homelessness often arises from mental illness or addiction. Not exactly a fair comparison. You are assuming that these people are struggling to survive and could die out at any time. \n\n&gt; Because I am a fan of a society that provides goods and services to all people, and uses all the human resources available to it to the benefit of us all.\n\nThis essentially comes down to \"I think they should have luxuries, because everyone should have luxuries.\"\n\nThat's a fine opinion, but it's not convincing. Is there a moral reason why they should have luxuries? Will it make their lives better? By better I do not mean more comfortable, I mean: reduced anxiety or stress, more satisfaction, a more relaxed life, etc.\n\n&gt;  The state of human existance is to never be happy with what you have, to always want more, and so on.\n\nDoes that mean people should simply chase pleasures? Who leads happier lives, people looking for the next high or people who address their irrational desires/hedonistic treadmill and start to appreciate what they have?\n\n&gt;Westerners live lives that are longer, spent less in pain, safer, more productive, \n\nWestern lives are longer and less physically painful. Productivity is a silly comparison. You're assuming that it's important for people to go work the 9-5 and create cars, create apps, or whatever it is productive western society does.\n\n&gt;and better in just about every way. \n\nNo we really are not. We are only technologically advanced that is all. **You are using western standards to judge their society; of course they aren't going to hold up.**\n\nThe only metric we can really use to judge their society is human satisfaction. That is what all humans, regardless of culture or circumstance seek. Technology =/= satisfaction.\n\n&gt;All cultural aspects of a happy and low-lived life are also things that exist in western culture, \n\nYet we are not particularly happy. We're fat, insolent, and waiting for the next ipad or blockbuster.\n\n&gt;we aren't preserving some \"better way of existence\" by keeping these natives around.\n\nNor are we making their lives much more enjoyable and wholesome. We would simply be introducing new pleasures.\nbioemerl: I am ignoring just about everything before this as the answer is basically \"yes\", outside of saying that western lifestyle means more anxiety or stress.\n\n&gt;Western lives are longer and less physically painful. Productivity is a silly comparison. You're assuming that it's important for people to go work the 9-5 and create cars, create apps, or whatever it is productive western society does.\n\nYeah, it is important for people to do those things.  Not only does it result in a higher national GDP, it allows people to have more of the things they want, while not having to spend their day growing food.\n\nWhy else would we do that near universally as a world?\n\n&gt;You are using western standards to judge their society; of course they aren't going to hold up.\n\nyou do not show how they do not hold up.  Instead you use vauge statements about how their lives are better because \"less stress\" as if it's less stressful to live in a tribe than it is in a modern society.  \n\nI am not saying we should force them into a new life, I am saying we contact them, and give them the option.  We give them luxuries, we give them a new life, and it is up to them to accept or deny it, not up to us.\n\n&gt;The only metric we can really use to judge their society is human satisfaction.\n\nThere is no \"only\" metric by which you can judge society.  Your metric here is no different than my \"western\" view.\n\n&gt;Yet we are not particularly happy. We're fat, insolent, and waiting for the next ipad or blockbuster.\n\nI already established that human beings are rarely, if ever, satisfied with the situation.  It's built into our mind to start wanting more, to always be unhappy with how we are.\n\nWe could have infinite wealth, and still be unhappy.  This does not mean that wealth is bad, or causes a lack of happyness.\n\nAnd \"fat western insolent\" people are the ones driving the society and economies that launch people to the moon, invent technology after technology, and thousands of other progressions.  Wealth and luxury are good things, and the fat and insolent people you think just chase after ipods and sit idly munching on food, the corporate cows, are a myth.  A self serving myth you create to make yourself feel edgy and better than the society that raised you and gave you all the information you have now.\n\nGuess what.  The reason society works the way it does today, and the reason modern society is so successful, is because the things we do *work*.\n\n&gt;We would simply be introducing new pleasures.\n\nSuch a crime, who would dare do such a thing!\n\nmeeeow: &gt; Why else would we do that near universally as a world?\n\nShould probably read a bit about colonisation there a bit skippy.\nbioemerl: Colonization happened a long time before commercialism did, and I don't think China moved over to a more open and western system due to it.\n\nI am talking about US culture, Hollywood, and so on.

{"full_text": "processus: what's everyone's take on qigong/chi gong/chi kung exercises?\nI know Yoga's pretty popular and well regarded here, so I was wondering if any of you guys have experience with the Chinese \"equivalent\". There are many variations, but I think the 8 brocades are the standard.\n\nWould this be a good supplement or replacement to the warm-up part of the RR?\n\nexamples:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VALao_FAT2k\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K-0JpiJu-o\nuser23187425: Hey, great question! Was thinking about asking something along that line at some point.\n\nI do Kung Fu forms as well as breathing excercises as an addition of my bw-routine. Not as a warm-up, rather as a \"yin\"-part to it. I do the Wing Chun-forms, as demonstrated by Wong Shun Leung (direct teacher of Bruce Lee or Bruce Lee's Si-Hing which means \"older borther\") [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crmGYEvLVcw) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ckHE4X8yUk) (Done correctly, they can also be regarded as body-line work, since you're supposed to have a straight spine, like in the hollow hold, and tight abs). I do them really slow, so they become more of an [internal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neijia) excercise. I also do the [Micro Cosmic Orbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQ7V2P124) as often as possible. It would be recommended to learn excercises like these from qualified teachers, you need to be corrected, at least in the Wing Chun forms.\n\nI'm thinking about going more into Chi Kung, but actually am pretty happy with my routine right now. Also, what i like about Wing Chun is that it is more of use and a little bit more applyable than Chi Gong or Tai Chi, combines learning something useful, interesting with working out. Obviously, i have a background in Wing Chun, but at the moment i'm also experimenting with Kali-stick drills on top of that, great for mobility. \n\nSo what i'm suggesting is: Find something that you like and integrate it into your routine.\nresolvetochange: Do you believe in all of the energy talk? I like concepts like yoga and kung fu but I look at them like stretching (yoga) and breathing/hot yoga (kung fu). The spirituality / mystics / energy talk turns me off of it a bit though. Just curious what others think about it.\n\nuser23187425: I don't believe it, i experience it.\n\nI can totally understand your reservations. I hate all that guru-shit. But over the years, i've made some experiences. When you start learning to treat yourself with acupuncture and it works, you don't doubt anymore. \n\nIt doesn't have to be spiritual, at least not in the new-age-sense. That's what i really like about the chinese systems, they are down to earth. (Mostly.) I also have my priorities straight. I'm not looking for spiritual enlightenment, i'm looking to be involved in this world. (Which might not be so much different, according to some approaches.)\n\nEDIT: \"\u00d6tzi\" had [acupuncture points tattooed on his body for self-treatment](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/new-tattoos-found-otzi-iceman-support-prehistoric-acupuncture-theory-1485224). This knowledge has just been lost in the west, but fortunatly, not all together.\nresolvetochange: I rather like a few chinese systems, things like acupunture, cupping, etc. I've experienced them because it seemed like something cool to try. They did make me feel good and it was interesting but in terms of medical effect I don't think it made a difference.

I also think you lack any evidence at all of why the word was created. I think you are just making a poor-quality circular argument: happy people are preferable over sad people because happy is preferred to sad.\n\nThis argument is easy to refute: if someone I cared about dies, I would prefer to be sad rather than to be happy. After all, happiness and sadness don't have any relative rankings in contextless preference. Instead, they are functional emotional responses to situations. You usually hope to get the one that properly corresponds to the situation, since that indicates sanity. You don't hope to get happiness over sadness in all cases.\n[deleted]: And sanity, in the big picture, makes us happy. It's still a pursuit of happy over sad, because happy is a word that was defined to describe something we like by default. \nOlathe: That's confusing, since sadness is then a requirement of sanity which leads to happiness. So in this case happiness isn't preferred to sadness, instead happiness is produced partially by past sadness.\n[deleted]: It's the exact opposite of confusing. People made up the word \"happy\" to describe a state that we like. People made up the word \"sad\" to describe a state that we do not like. Therefore happiness is de facto preferred to sadness, and even though sadness is preferred in certain contexts, it's only because it promotes happiness in a macro sense.\nOlathe: The circumstances around the creation of the words and the motives of the creators is pretty irrelevant to the conclusion, particularly because those people might have been wrong or foolish, so you'd need to show that they weren't, which would be quite an inefficient way to get to the conclusion.\n\nYou might as well just say \"We like happiness. We dislike sadness. Therefore, it's a fact that people prefer happiness to sadness\". This is, of course, circular reasoning and can't really help someone who is asking why one is preferable (circular reasoning doesn't even help us to determine that they are preferable and, more importantly, that they are preferable is not an answer to the question of why they are preferable, which was the question).\n\nThis discussion is about morals, though, not about facts. Why is it morally preferred to be happy?\n[deleted]: Because morals are about what ought to be, and since happy is a word that was made to describe something better than being sad, happy is the way things ought to be as opposed to sad.\n\n&gt;You might as well just say \"We like happiness. We dislike sadness. Therefore, it's a fact that people prefer happiness to sadness\".\n\nThat's accurate though, and while you think it's circular reasoning, it isn't. Your question is the part that makes no sense, when you ask \"why is happiness preferred?\" you might as well ask \"why is blue blue?\"\n\nYou are literally asking \"Why is the state that we find preferable the state that we find preferable?\" It's preferred because people like it better than the alternative. That's really all there is to it, there is no magical reason that happiness is better than sadness, it simply is what it is.\nOlathe: &gt; Because morals are about what ought to be, and since happy is a word that was made to describe something better than being sad, happy is the way things ought to be as opposed to sad.\n\nI think you're equivocating here. Better has two different senses: I'd like to experience that and it would be morally preferable if that happened.\n\nAs you can imagine, if what people would like to experience was equivalent to morality, morality would be quite a bit simpler to discuss. Sociopaths who violated others would not be morally abhorrent because they'd be happier and thus they ought to have done what they did.\n[deleted]: &gt;As you can imagine, if what people would like to experience was equivalent to morality, morality would be quite a bit simpler to discuss. \n\nWay to put words in my mouth. The point isn't that what people would like to experience is moral, morality is that which we ought to do. \"Happy\" is the way all creatures with preferences prefer to be. Therefore happiness is de facto better than sadness, and therefore the way we ought to behave is the way that leads to happiness.\n\n&gt;Sociopaths who violated others would not be morally abhorrent because they'd be happier and thus they ought to have done what they did.\n\nI'm going to ignore the part where you deliberately misconstrued my point to make this stupid one, and simply point out that the moral weighting of one sociopath will always be less than that of the sum total of other individuals he/she violates, thereby rendering the point stupid on your terms as well as mine.\nOlathe: I'm not sure how I was supposed to realize the details you hadn't yet specified. This is the first time you've mentioned weightings at all in this thread, for instance.\n\nIt seems pretty weird to me to say things like 'dafuq' when you haven't even come close to explaining what the person is missing. You just talk very, very, very vaguely and then complain when people don't infer all the unsaid details and proofs of what you think is true.\n[deleted]: I'm sorry, I should've specified that \"many\" weighs more than \"few\"?\n\nYou're still an idiot 23 days later.\nOlathe: Usually when people discuss the fundamentals of ethics with any skill, they define their terms with quite a bit more detail than you apparently did. I was assuming that you had taken the effort to specify things at least to the level that it didn't leave out major components, like that your ethical system is based on some kind of calculus.\n\nAs you seem to be unaware, there are systems of ethics in which weightings don't play a role at all.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: Will dumbell OHP improves my pike-push ups ?\nHello, i have a question. I train calisthenics like 3 months now, im bigger, stronger. I never trained pike-push ups (as progression to handstand etc.) always did just dips, push-ups and my shoulders grow even with just those 2 exercises, but they are not stronger.\n\nIm extremely weak for shoulder pressing, so my max are like 1-2 pike push-ups with correct technique when im fresh, but if i add it to my training routine, especially after push-ups/dips i cant do even 1. I have some bands and light dumbells so i was thinking about doing dumbell overhed press for classic 6-12 rep range until i gain strenght to be able to do some pike-push ups in my routine.\n\nI have just question, i know both are shoulder pressing movements, but do you think that dumbell pressing will improve my pike-push ups, or its something different and even with progress on dumbells, i wont be able to do more pikes ? Thanks\nMindfulMover: &gt;I have just question, i know both are shoulder pressing movements, but do you think that dumbell pressing will improve my pike-push ups\n\nProbably not THAT much. In fact, I think the carryover is better the other way around. What I would do is this...\n\n&gt; are like 1-2 pike push-ups with correct technique when im fresh\n\n...At the BEGINNING of your workout and that should work better! Try a few sets of one.  Another thing I would do is remember that you can use a version with your KNEES on an elevated surface and your HANDS on the ground/blocks/paralletes to reduce the intensity of the Pike Pushup until you're stronger.\njustjr112: This is false. \n\nDumbbell pressing will carryover to pike pressing ability. \n\nShow me someone who can ohp 60% of their bodyweight and I'll show you show you someone who can rep out pike push ups. ( Bodyweight being relative) \n\nI'd say a Pike push up is sub 50 percent of your bodyweight so working up to 50 percent of you your bodyweight with dumbbell or barbell pressing is a good way to increase pike pressing. \n\n\nI'd do something like\n\nPike push ups 2 x failure \nDumbbell presses 2-5 x 10 \nClose grip push ups 2 x failure\nMindfulMover: &gt;Dumbbell pressing will carryover to pike pressing ability.\n\nI'm not saying there is ZERO carryover. Just not that much. Not enough to bother with it. I'd go with the Knee Piked Pushup route. It's more specific and it will improve both the HSPU and the DB OHP too. :D\njustjr112: Don't talk in absolutes if you are basing your arguments on personal experiences. \n\nDumbbell pressing in my opinion will benefit pipe push-ups handstand push-ups and military person just as much as the others why because it's the same muscles. Progressive overload is real and you can microload better with dumbbells then you can with making 15 to 35% jumps with calisthenics. \n\nThe correct answer is do both\nMindfulMover: &gt;Don't talk in absolutes if you are basing your arguments on personal experiences.\n\n&gt;Probably not THAT much.\n\nCan you show me where the absolute is there? ;D\n\n&gt;Dumbbell pressing in my opinion will benefit pipe push-ups handstand push-ups and military person just as much as the others why because it's the same muscles.\n\nI doubt this. \n\n&gt;The correct answer is do both\n\nWhy? You could just do the Pike Pushups which are more specific and gain on that PLUS the DB OHP. If you can come up with a better reason, I'm open to hearing it. But the idea that you can't make small adjustments with calisthenics is incorrect. In fact, you can make BETTER adjustments with Calisthenics. You can go DOWN in a Pike and UP on the knees! So I'd say that's another plus for Pike PU over DB OHP. \n\nIf you get another reason, I'm open to hearing it.\njustjr112: I've already given the reason. \n\nMicro loading. \n\nNote these numbers are examples: \n\nPike push up down 50 percent - down on knees 25 percent. \n\nSay your max dumbbell press is 25 pounds for 10 next set do 20 for 10 again. The drop isn't 25 percent closer to 10. Which means volume and intensity are better managed. \n\nAgain you can do one or the other but why limited one self if there's no actual reason not to?\nMindfulMover: &gt;Note these numbers are examples:Pike push up down 50 percent - down on knees 25 percent.\n\nIt's not a solid example though because remember, we can adjust the load of the Pike Pushup mid rep by shifting how much load we have on our hands. So it could be a MUCH bigger variety. In fact, I can go down with most of my weight on my hands at the top, less near the bottom, and come up on the knees with some weight on the hands then as much as I can on the top. You can adjust the load much better!\n\n&gt;Say your max dumbbell press is 25 pounds for 10 next set do 20 for 10 again. The drop isn't 25 percent closer to 10. Which means volume and intensity are better managed.\n\nThe above example shows how you can do this with even more variety with the Pike Pushup so if you're giving this as an advantage of DB OHP, it would apply to both.\n\n&gt;Again you can do one or the other but why limited one self if there's no actual reason not to?\n\nI gave the reason: The Pike Pushup is more specific and will have more carryover to the Pike Pushup than DB OHP. No point in using less useful tool.\njustjr112: Or you can use the dumbbells and not have to do all the Hocus pocus * shrugs \n\nLess useful as defined by YOU and nothing else.\nMindfulMover: SAID principle would define them as less useful. Just like if OPs goal was the highest DB OHP, then Pike Pushup would be less useful.\njustjr112: Pike push ups DO help ohp. Because they are both ohps. There's a ton of anecdotal evidence from guys like alpha destiny ,Louis Simmons and westside barbell. Over 40 years worth. Exercise variation isn't \" less useful\"\nMindfulMover: &gt; Exercise variation isn't \" less useful\"\n\nIf my goal is to Squat 500 pounds, what do you think is going to be MORE useful... Leg Extensions? Or Squats?\njustjr112: The answer is it depends. \n\n*Box squats, *hack squats * pause squats and yes leg extensions if you have a weakness in the lock out position or if you need extra volume without the drain on your cns. \n\nMilitary press, handstand push ups, dumbbell presses pike pushups are all similar variations and all have carry over to one another. Conjugate method works as proven by 100s of athletes If you don't want to use it that's fine but dismissing it as not not effective is wrong.\nMindfulMover: You still didn't answer which is going to be MORE useful. Do you think Squats and Leg Extensions are going to be equally useful if the goal is obtaining at 500 pound squat?\njustjr112: I did answer, you just didn't like it. \n\nI said it depends on the situation. Obviously you need to squat but at a certain point just squatting more will do more hard then good see overuse injuries.  Leg extensions can help particularly in the muscle building portion as well as strengthening the teardrop muscle which does a lot of the heavy lifting once your knee angle hits the 90\u00b0 angle. \n\nAgain in this example what does this person need, it's lazy to assume he needs more squatting. Is his form bad,  is he squatting high bar low bar? Is he losing strength in certain parts of the movement etc. Context matters.\n\nYou can increase tut and slow down the knee pike pu to increase intensity or you can switch out the 15s for the 20 Pound dumbbells . \n\nLet's spot pretending that like like push ups are Olympic lifts and pushing brands/dogma. Pike push ups are low on the skill level and require more over all strength. Get stronger however you want and pikes will be easier to do.\nMindfulMover: I think most people would agree the bulk of the gains are going to come from the Squat. If you think Leg Extensions and Squats are going to give the same amount of gain towards the goal of Squatting 500 pounds... then I'm not sure what to say to that except we will have to agree to disagree and hope you have good training! :D\njustjr112: Your not listening.... There's nothing more disheartening then trying to have an intelligent conversation then having someone with try to strawman you or pick out parts without context... Enjoy the holidays.\nMindfulMover: Thanks, man! Even if we disagree, I enjoyed the conversation.

And it's on both sides of the aisle and isn't likely to change anytime soon.\nConsciousTie2854: And that\u2019s the problem. It won\u2019t change for a reason. Money, power, influence. Pick one. We need to stop allowing this to happen. Voting hasn\u2019t helped and money flowing to politicians ensures that\u2019s how it\u2019ll stay.

Shouldn't that be all we need to know to stop systematically bleeding it into our PUBLIC DRINKING WATER?\n\nDuh.\nwaldowv: Bullshit.  Calling the levels \"similar\" is a lie.  EPA recommends (and Portland proposed) 0.7mg/L, which is less than the \"control\" in most of these studies.\n\nThe takeaway is that everything can be poisonous and toxic in high enough levels.  Recommended intake of water for women is 2.2 l/day, but drinking 6 can kill you.\n[deleted]: Tell me - how does the government control how much fluoride is ingested by each and every person?\n\nTell me that.\nwaldowv: Do I need to explain what the word \"concentration\" means?  You take 100,000 liters of water and put in 70 grams of fluoride.  Don't put in 7000.  Don't put in 700,000.  Use a scale if you're doing it by hand.  Or, better yet, set up a foolproof automatic dispenser.  \n\n100,000 liters of water is the size of an average swimming pool.  70 grams is about how much fits in a salt shaker.\n\nSince fluoride's time in the blood is short, it is simply not possible to get a 10x dose.\n\n[deleted]: I didn't ask how they control the concentration of fluoride in the water, i asked how they control the dosages of fluoride in each and every person's BODY.\n\nDoes each person drink a different amount of water, and therefore receive differing amounts of fluoride on a daily basis?\n\nwaldowv: Yes, different people will ingest and *immediately excrete/remove from the blood* slightly different microgram totals of fluoride.  Since it is excreted so quickly, the total intake is essentially irrelevant.  Since you won't believe me/science, don't you wonder why all the studies in Table 1 are listed by concentration?\n\nTo put it another way, I'm in my 30s and have drunk hundreds of gallons of liquor in my lifetime.  That does not mean that I am more likely to die from alcohol poisoning tonight than someone whose 21st birthday is today.  It just doesn't stick around.\nladycharles: You could still die of liver failure... I think a good point to make here is that fluoridation has been around since the 50s, but not forever. I don't think you will disagree that, perhaps, we don't know all there is to know about the long-term, or really life-term, effects of fluoridation. This is why he is asking about the concentrations in the individual body, because little is said about the accumulation over such a long time. There are some of us that don't really want to find out the hard way, years down the road. When there are other options, can you really blame people who see it as unethical for wanting to opt out?\nwaldowv: That's reaching at straws.  For one thing, studies go back to 1900 and, I believe, it was in 1946 that municipalities actually started adding it in earnest because of the prior studies.  Regardless, there is no disease that I can think of that has *perfectly statistically silent* incubation of over 60 years.  By 60, something like 13% of Americans will already be dead which, in the case of fluoride, means that the data set has tens of millions of people in it, none of whose deaths can be attributed to properly fluorinated municipal water.  How many statistics are enough for you?\n\nOr are you against fluoridation for some other reason, and just reaching at straws?\nladycharles: Okay well we just aren't going to agree on this. I disagree with fluoride for a multitude of reasons but the main one is: I have not given anyone the authority to medicate me. For this very basic reason I am against it. \nwaldowv: I believe the term \"medicine\" in this context does not apply to fluoride.  Most \"medicines\" we encounter today have downsides, side effects, and dangers.  They are taken by small groups effected by things like acid reflux as a calculated risk, weighed against things like drymouth. Fluoride in the concentrations used in municipal water supplies has no side effects.  None.  I'm not saying that to be rhetorical/bombastic, I'm saying that because it is scientific fact.  I support fluoridation.  I do not support the addition of things like ibuprofen or antibiotics--drugs with known side effects and downsides.  Fluoride is different. \nladycharles: I'm not going to debate you on your feelings. This has already been defined by the FDA. Please see How Does The Law Define a Drug? http://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/ucm074201.htm\nwaldowv: I'm not saying it's not a medicine in the technical sense, I'm saying the anti-'s use that word because it creates connotations for laypeople that are external to the technical meaning and illicit an emotional response that works to their advantage.  I'm saying from a *moral* perspective, it is not a medicine in the same way that Viagra and Lipitor are.\nladycharles: If it's by definition a medicine, I'm not going to treat it as anything but that, regardless of the implied connotations you've created to use against me. (The anti-s?!) I'm commenting on a thread about fluoride where people such as yourself are debating the science and ethics of the practice &amp; now I'm accused of abusing the term 'medication' as if I'm sensationalizing it by using its actual classification. I agree that its not kin to putting viagra &amp; lipitor in the public water, but mainly because that is absolutey bananas and not in any way shape or form comparable to fluoride. \nwaldowv: Ok, well how about this: suppose there's a chemical compound that makes children under the age of 12 bulletproof.  Every mass shooting from on out will have zero children injured.  No side effects at all.  Only catch is, everyone has to take it.  It's medicine all right.

How are schools emotionally and mentally supporting students if we go into lockdown?\nr0gu39: As a teacher - we know remote learning was less than stellar.  We know hybrid was difficult.  We know kids learn better in school.  This pandemic has taught me that everyone thinks they know how to do my job better than me - and yet know one is stepping up to be a teacher while states are hemorrhaging teachers.

Did your district outfit you with the office setup and internet connectivity to do this?

The people who need to do better aren't teachers, it's the folks planning and appropriating dollars behind them.\nr0gu39: To be honest - we were able to take laptops and our course textbooks home.  That was it.  We had some trainings, but most were on technology and programs many of us already used.  Our \"best practices\" PD was all window dressing and no substance.  Administration and government offered \"trainings\" that didn't apply or wouldn't actually work in practice - and that was all we got.\nSnappaDaBagels: Isn't that insane? Here you are being asked to do your job in a totally different way. And you get no support. Of course there will be failure. \n\nI don't fault school districts for failing in 2020. Everyone was trying to react to a changing world. \n\nBut I will fault districts in 2021. They've now had over a year to build up a process to teach in a Covid-19 world. We should expect they support teachers much more, and that this in turn makes the student experience that much better too.\nr0gu39: Hopefully they do offer more support.

Or anything in between because God's \"plan\" is ineffable, and as such you can't presume anything about God's will, intentions or plan.\nReddit_Repartee: You're really not keeping to the theist definition of \"God\" here. God isn't just a powerful being, according to the tradition being considered here, he is omnibenevolent. If a powerful being created the universe with malicious intent or anything other than maximal good possible, he wouldn't be \"God\" by that very definition. You can certainly try to attack the idea that God is necessarily omnibenevolent, but a Christian would likely say that a non-benevolent God is like a married bachelor -- it is a contradiction. I'm not a theist, but if you're going to attack the theist's argument, at least entertain his primary axiom.\neterneraki: Omni benevolence is not an attribute that all religions accept as fact.\nReddit_Repartee: Agreed completely. However, the author of the argument being considered is from the Greek Orthodox tradition, a subdivision of the Christian tradition. Therefore, attempting to parse the argument outside of that tradition is like trying to critique one view of  metaphysics by using a completely different, potentially incompatible view.\neterneraki: This is the first time I'm hearing that greek orthodox adherents believe in omni benevolence, but I guess if that's the case then we can continue down that argument. But then \"best world\" is relative and separate rabbit hole\nSocile: As my previous comment was removed for expressing an opinion, I will assert as fact that I am more benevolent than the Judeo-Christian \u201cGod.\u201d  I would simply choose to give one less child terminal cancer.  Therefore, I AM more benevolent than God.\n\nAlso, by virtue of being real, I am more benevolent.\nJWOLFBEARD: This is riddled with fallacies. For instance, what shows that one less case of cancer provides greater benevolence?\nSocile: Preventing suffering.  This is one example.  I could eliminate diarrhea altogether with a thought and prevent loads of suffering.\nJWOLFBEARD: Yes. But there could be major repercussions to eliminating diarrhea that would cause greater suffering.\nsawbladex: couldn't you just fix that?\n\nSure, it might be an infinite rabbit hole of fixing, but omni-whatever is the biggest infinite, so there you go.\nJWOLFBEARD: Right. So that shows that there may not be a better level of beneficence available.\nsawbladex: By shows, ... you mean a really weird thought experiment that makes assumptions that the world can only be exactly the way it is .... for some nebulous goodness.\n\nA god whose max goodness involves me be hit by a car is one I could do without.\nweebeardedman: But, the thing is, \"gods plan\" isn't about you. That's the whole point, it doesn't matter at all what happens to individuals, it's what is good for humanity as a whole. God might be all powerful, but hes also all knowing, and knows that every action has a consequence. Being all powerful is \"pointless\" if you're trapped into acting with what you think will result in the \"best outcome.\" If, for example in this \"car crash,\" you die but the other person would kill more than 2 people...net gain. Or, if the crash resulted in someone being inspired to study safety related engineering and ended up saving many more lives...net gain.\n\n\n\nIf, for things to be \"the best they can be\" for everyone, and that involves you being hit by a car, then you gon be hit by a car. \n\nAt least that's how I understand the whole suffering existing thing if a God could exist.\nSocile: There are people who seem to suffer (and/or die) for no reason at all (diseases, mutilation, psychological suffering, etc.).  To say that this is necessary on a macro scale is an extraordinary claim from no evidence and would require quite a lot of evidence to be anything but a joke.\nknaet: The thing to remember is that much of the theological approach here is definitive. For example, the following \"truths\":\n\n1. God is that which nothing greater (i.e. \"gooder\") can be conceived.\n2. God exists.\n3. God is omnibenevolent (among other things) (again, by definition, because he is the \"goodest\").\n4. God created the universe as best as it possibly can be, because god is omnibenevolent.\n5. Suffering is a part of the best possible option.\n\nThere are certainly some issues here, but that's the gist of it. It leads to all kinds of weird conclusions...but that's neither here nor there.\n\nAnd remember, theology is ultimately based in faith, which is to say the virtue of actively *not* relying on evidence.\noffensivename: &gt;which is to say the virtue of actively not relying on evidence.\n\nThat's not entirely true. Faith doesn't mean rejecting all evidence. It's simply a means to bridge the gap between what you can prove and what you cannot prove. People with a belief in the supernatural rely on facts as much as anyone else. They just hold personal belief and experiences to be of equal or greater weight when it comes to such matters.\nknaet: I didn't mean to say faith is a rejection of evidence. I mean to say that faith is believing in something *without* it.\noffensivename: Fair enough. Though I don't think that's exactly right either. I would say that it's believing in something without a certain level of evidence. Incontrovertible maybe? Is that the right word? Theists have all kinds of evidence for their beliefs. It's just not evidence that atheists find credible. The same goes for people who believe in ghosts or psychics or other supernatural occurrences.\nknaet: That is a really good point. I've never really thought about them as seeing their reasons to believe as evidence, and from their perspective it must look like it. I generally think of evidence as a scientific or empirical thing, but there is certainly an argument to made against that.\n\nDo you think it detracts from the perceived value of faith, though, if they see themselves as actually using evidence? I don't know what doctrine on this actually says...\noffensivename: I'm not familiar with a religious tradition that would consider having some sort of evidence to devalue faith. If you look at Christianity specifically, the Judeo-Christian God often gave direct evidence of his existence through miracles, directly conversing with people, etc. Then there's Jesus who played it a bit more cool when it came to declaring himself God, but provided evidence of his divinity in the form of miracles as well.\n\nIn present day, isn't that what the whole field of apologetics is about? Much of it centers around attempting to prove the unprovable by using logic and reason. Then of course there's people like Ken Ham who use generally pretty bogus science to attempt to prove their beliefs. There's obviously a lot of Christians who are not down with what Ham is doing with his creation museum and Answers in Genesis website, but I think it has more to do with it being bad science than any philosophical objections to an evidence-inclusive belief system.\nknaet: Hmm, I may be remembering incorrectly. I have some pretty distinct memories of my church days where it was frowned upon to bring up evidence or proof, because god values faith in and of itself. Relying on evidence implies some sort of doubt in the Word itself, and we know from the example of Thomas that doubt is a bad trait to have. \n\nThe strict adherence to faith is what drove me away in the first place...and now I'm starting to wonder if it was my understanding of what faith meant more than anything. Or perhaps it's just how the methodists approach it that I didn't like? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm happily divorced from the church, but it's a weird thing to analyze from this side of that choice.\n", "prompt": "reasonably_doubtful1: Theists need to believe in libertarian free will in order to provide an adequate response to the problem of evil.\n\notah007: &gt; Hart\u2019s defense of universalism and his apparent rejection of libertarian free will made me consider whether the four propositions below are jointly compatible:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.

That statistic changed my mind because - despite my initial preconceptions - I could simply not think of any way that 1/3 of African-American men commit prison-worthy crimes.  If the number had been much smaller, I could have gone on assuming that judicial racism was a minor factor.  But 1/3 means it has to be a large and disturbing factor.\nchampionofobscurity: &gt;&gt;That statistic changed my mind because - despite my initial preconceptions - I could simply not think of any way that 1/3 of African-American men commit prison-worthy crimes\n\nDid you question how the arrived at that number though? Because what percentage of that 1/3 is a bunch of dudes sleeping off their booze in the drunk tank? &lt;&lt; That matters, because those individuals do not accurately reflect the issue that is trying to be displayed. It fits under a broad point, with a narrow definition.\nGnosticGnome: No, that's prison and not jail.  I.e. went to trial and was convicted.  If we include jails it's even higher.  See [here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ascii/LLGSFP.TXT) for a slightly outdated version.\nchampionofobscurity: You're getting hung up on the specific thing you mentioned, My argument is that most people will look deeper. and find an component they disagree with.\nGnosticGnome: Maybe, but I personally couldn't.  I couldn't think of any plausible thing to quibble on.  Were prisoners lying to their wardens and claiming to be black?  Surely that's super rare.  Were people sneaking out of jail, getting a new false identity, then getting convicted with the new identity?  Again, surely super rare.  Do we systematically undercount the number of African-Americans present in the country?  Maybe a little.\n\nAnyway, I'm just giving you an example of a statistic that changed my mind.  I assume you just want anecdotes, right?  Or were you hoping for a social statistic on the number of people who say social statistics change their minds?  \nchampionofobscurity: I'm not looking for a statistic, nor am I looking for anecdotes.\n\nI am looking for perhaps someone who can shed light on the reality of social studies and show that my point of view or frame of reference is incorrect. \nGnosticGnome: The reality is that \"social science\" is a very broad field.  It contains crap that merely reflects the biases of those producing it, and it contains experimental designs that have to work because a lot is at stake and the people funding it care only about consistent results.\n\nIf you are just looking at academic journals where researchers are incentivized by publication count, of course you'll find a lot of shoddy work.  If you look at focus groups assembled by expensive advertising firms or political consultants, you aren't as likely to find that.  There may exist some companies and candidates that just want an echo chamber, but many demand (and reward) consistent results that help them narrowly tailor messages to specific groups.  If the approach in Racine should differ from the approach in Peoria, they want to know and quantify that.  And there are (dark-side?) social scientists who will help them do it.  A pragmatic CEO or candidate will not just trust her own assumptions about Peoria but will want those studies to change her view and make sure it matches reality on the ground.\n\nIt's of course not just market research.

I love climbing trees / travel rings / swinging / rock climbing / horizontal bar /   etc... considering how nearly all these things are mostly based on pulling / hanging would I benefit from a workout plan with mostly pulling exercises? for example, instead of 3 pull / 3 push programs. should I try a program with 4-5 pulling exercises and only 1-2 pushing exercises like dips / pushup?\n\nmany thanks\n\n\n\n\neshlow: If you want to ask questions about the book you can post them over to /r/overcominggravity\n\n1. Generally speaking, that's fine. You can add small iso holds if you wanted to exercises in your routine. For example, if you are doing pseudo planche pushups you can add 1-2s holds at the top of the movement to get planche leans in.\n\n2. No, the main reason why I recommend dips + pushups variations first for beginners is because training all of it plus HSPUs is generally too much. Plus dips are better at building brute strength and muscle mass and non-specific strength factors which you can use later for HSPUs. You can eventually phase out one of pushups/dips for HSPUs.\n\n3. Shoulder and hip mobility are good. Solid RTO support and german hang are good for elbow conditioning for harder movements. See chapter 4 or 5 I think for recommended movements.\n\n4. No. Keep pulling and pushing balanced. Injuries are a concern with imbalances, and having more pulling is not going to make you improve after a certain point anyway. Excessive amounts of pullups and rows don't help say rock climbing that much... what is important is the strength which can be done with minimal exercises which is applied to the rock in skill work/practice. This is why S&amp;C is mainly targeted at improving attributes rather than actual abilities.\nmontevisko: If isometric's aren't at all necessary how would a progression to straddle planche push up on rings looks like with only dynamic exercises?\neshlow: I got straddle planche on rings with RTO PPPUs with a 1-2s hold at the top of every rep, weighted dips, and handstand pushups. So basically, the RTO PPPUs double as planche lean holds + dynamic exercise\nMovementTom: this is going to depend a lot on your body structure. If you have a good lever length ratio, like being short and light, then it's going to be much easier than someone who tall and heavy.

{"full_text": "crankyozzie: Rebuilding/restoring a \"computer desk\"\nHello, DIYers. I plan on starting my first ever DIY project soon. Hopefully within the next couple of weeks. Essentially, I will be either making a (almost) copy of a desk/entertainment unit thingy I already have that is old and worn out, or restoring and altering it.\nI have yet to decide which of these options would be cheapest. Here are some photos and a description !\n[1](http://i.imgur.com/hzTrS)  [2](http://i.imgur.com/P4FLz)\n\nThe whole thing consists of 4 parts (discluding drawers). A \"side table\" a corner unit, and 2 lots of shelves that just sit on the corner unit. As you can see in the first image the corner unit, which is where the monitor, keyboard, etc sits is not as deep as the \"side table\" unit.\nIn the second picture you can see that the shelve units are not attached to the corner unit. They simply sit there.\n\nIf I were to rebuild the whole thing, I'd basically take the current dimensions, leaving them as-is with the eception of the corner unit, which I would extend back to sit flush with the back end of the side table part (which also has a drawer, by the way). I would also like to remove the two bottom drawers on the corner section, and replace/build a \"half height\" drawer where the top drawer currently is. This would enable me to sit more comfortably at the computer. Perhaps I would alter the shelves above the corner unit a bit too. Reduce their shelf height, therefore giving me room to put more shelves in. Another thing I wish to do is keep the whole affair modular, as it is, but have some sort of setup where I could connect all the pieces (Dowel and hole for the shelves maybe? nort sure about the side desk and corner unit)\n\nWhat is the general opinion? Restore and alter, or take general measurements and rebuild the whole thing again? Keep in mind I am inexperienced when it comes to woodwork, will be using limited tools (basically a drill, hammer, *maybe* some kind of power saw. yes I have access to screwdrivers, etc), and live in Australia (so cost of materials would be more than they are in the US, possibly) \nWhispertron: Yay desk building! My favourite furniture build projects. :D\n\nIt would help to know what these units are made of, because that can either make or break the idea of refurbishing it. If this is made of plywood with plastic laminate you'll have a lot of work cut out for you to try and make alterations look good. How are the parts held together? Are the fasteners sunk into the panels or are they the sort which sit in the right angle formed by the panel corners?\n\nOne possibility would be to replace the desktops. Take the current ones off, keep the leg panels and drawer assemblies but cut new desk surfaces out of MDF or similar. This would let you make a desk top for the corner unit that is the same depth as the desk unit and be a quick refurb as most of the wear appears to be on the edges of the current desktops.\n\nMost larger DIY warehouses like Bunnings* have a service where they'll cut the large sheets of plywood, MDF, etc that you find in the lumber section to size. You won't get diagonal cuts done but if you plan the cuts right you'll only have to to a bit of additional cutting yourself. I'd highly recommend using a circle saw for things like adding the diagonal to get nice, straight cuts.\n\nDowel and hole is your best bet for securing the shelf units in place once you have finished with the desktops. How are the shelves held into their current positions in the units? You could drill holes and use dowels or pegs to be able to change their height on a whim, much like one sees in Ikea shelves. \n\n*: I don't know whether Bunnings is a national chain but it is where I got my materials from when I lived in Brisbane.\ncrankyozzie: &gt;It would help to know what these units are made of, because that can either make or break the idea of refurbishing it. \n\nYou know, I never checked what they were made of. I think they are actually chipboard with laminate. The shelves on the corner piece are *not* fastened on, at all. It is a really cheap and nasty piece of furniture. After a wee bit more thought, it'd be better for me to just take down the dimensions and start from scratch. Actually, now I recall, trying to move the side desk caused one part of it to start to break off. This is why there is the gap between it and the corner section in the photos.\nI am unsure if I should just go with pine (cheap, readily available) and a stain, or something a bit stronger and more expensive.\n\n&gt;Most larger DIY warehouses like Bunnings* have a service where they'll cut the large sheets of plywood, MDF, etc that you find in the lumber section to size.\n\nYeah I know. The closest Bunnings is about 2 hours drive away though. There's a Mitre 10 about 40 minutes from where I live, the problem is transporting the materials back.\n\n&gt;Dowel and hole is your best bet for securing the shelf units in place once you have finished with the desktops. How are the shelves held into their current positions in the units? You could drill holes and use dowels or pegs to be able to change their height on a whim, much like one sees in Ikea shelves. \n\nThey are *not* held in at all. I will likely go with dowelling to secure them. The whole thing does not get moved very often.\nWhispertron: I've just had a thought. If the assembly is not going to be moved very often and you're only looking for a way to stop the shelving units from shifting due to getting bumped then consider using velcro. Seriously. Strips of velcro stapled on will keep the shelving units in place and still come apart easy enough when you need it to. Also means you don't have to futz around with getting the holes and dowels lined up, which is a right pain in the backside.\n\nI've had no issues with using pine for this sort of project in the past. Has the advantage that it is reasonably light and also takes stain well. Once built a desk out of MDF which became a permanent feature in the room because the bugger was too heavy to lift and also too wide for the doorway. Anyway, Mitre 10 should be able to sort you out with the materials but I don't think they do a cutting service.\n\ncrankyozzie: That is a neat piece of info. Velcro hm? I'll look into that. Yes I think pine will do fine. I don't intend on living in this house any longer than I have to, so I don't want anything too heavy. Plus I IwillI need to clean behind it at last once every so often.

You made a specific comment that you were a gun owner and then proceeded to say clips.  Gun owners don't say clips, 15 years playing COD all day say clips.  It is an invalidation of your supposed gun owner status.\nrockstang: I don't have anything to prove to someone who has no interest in having the debate to begin with.

You brought it upon yourself.\n\n&gt;Again, throw all of the red herrings you want it proves nothing but the unwillingness to have a realistic dialog.\n\nI'll have a dialog with an honest person.  You are clearly not a gun owner and have a very specific agenda.  Admit that, and we can have a realistic dialog.  Until then, you are the only one making the dialog unrealistic.\nrockstang: OK so I don't agree with your agenda so I am automatically discredited. I also say I roll down my window. Windows have been automatic for at least 20 years. I suppose by your logic I've never owned or driven a car? Why do I say clip and roll down your window? Because that is what I have always said.  And fuck it let's entertain your idea. I am a gun owner, but let's say for instance that I'm not. As a voting adult my say is every bit as important and valid as yours. Now let's take this all the way back to my original point. Making a distinction between automatic and semiautomatic is a silly one considering without a dealers license and permission from your county sherrif (in pa) owning a fully automatic isn't even possible. And again, if a semi auto can be fired at such a rate it is really just semantics whether you are firing 100 rounds per minute or 160. So yes in the bigger picture I think this YSK is a silly distinction to argue. But at the end of the day you take the same stance that nearly every NRA member does; if you are not with me you are against me. This is called the all or nothing fallacy. You call me dishonest but you really know nothing about me. I think the only one being dishonest is you saying you would be objective about this if I wasn't such a nasty little liar. School yard logic really isn't going to work here.\nLagkiller: &gt; OK so I don't agree with your agenda\n\nWow, did you actually read what I said?  Apparently not.  \n\n&gt;Windows have been automatic for at least 20 years. I suppose by your logic I've never owned or driven a car? \n\nNo, you are making a rather absurd analogy.  Clip is an actual tool, still in use today in guns manufactured.  It is a specific type of loading mechanism.  This is more akin to you saying you fill your car with diesel when you mean gasoline.\n\n&gt;I am a gun owner, but let's say for instance that I'm not. As a voting adult my say is every bit as important and valid as yours.\n\nNo shit sherlock.  The problem I have is that you are trying to pretend to be a gun owner as a means of drawing sympathy.  \"Hey guys, I own guns and I think these gun owners are wrong\".  Just as impersonating a army ranger at a bar to pick up chicks is wrong.\n\n&gt; Now let's take this all the way back to my original point. Making a distinction between automatic and semiautomatic is a silly one considering without a dealers license and permission from your county sherrif (in pa) owning a fully automatic isn't even possible.\n\nIt is a very important distinction, especially to people who don't own guns like yourself.  Have you ever fired a fully automatic weapon?  You can't just hold down the trigger for the entire magazine, they don't work like that.  But, people who have no working knowledge of firearms think [they are just that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJmFEv6BHM0).\n\nThese kinds of statements are ridiculous.  30 rounds in half a second sounds incredibly dangerous, even though it is impossible with the weapon he is holding, let alone any legal weapon in the US.\n\n&gt;But at the end of the day you take the same stance that nearly every NRA member does; if you are not with me you are against me.\n\nI am quite sure you don't even know what my stance is.  I do find it funny that you compare me to the NRA as I have not ever been a member, but ok.\n\n&gt;You call me dishonest but you really know nothing about me.\n\nYou claim to be a gun owner but several times have stated things that even the most basic gun owner knows are wrong.  You are lying to gain sympathy to your argument.\n\n&gt;I think the only one being dishonest is you saying you would be objective about this if I wasn't such a nasty little liar. School yard logic really isn't going to work here.\n\nAnd yet you keep using it?\nrockstang: I'm not going to be specific. You are exactly what is wrong with the whole debate.

To say that a single cell life form is not able to feel pain because they are not \u201caware of their existence\u201d is human folly, and paves the way to cruelty and a lack of awareness of their place in the universe.\nRonaldinhoMcDonald: Are you going to stop washing your hands?\nmindfungus: Who said anything about not killing any life, intentionally or unintentionally?\n\nAs a human, living in this world necessitates killing. Whether it\u2019s the bison, or cabbage, or the microbes we ingest. Life has to take life as a matter of survival.\n\nCruelty and sadism, on the other hand, are in a different realm. Knowing and deriving gratification over causing pain is a mental health issue.\nRightiesLackEmpathy: I think it's dangerous as FUCK to equate the lost life of a bison with the lost life of bacteria. why not apply that to humans? billions of bacteria die every picosefond, so who cares of humans die, right ..?\n[deleted]: Nature has no concern for morality - yours or anyone else's.  And correspondingly, it has no care about humans over bacteria.  We ascribe our own arbitrary value to a human v bison v bacteria.  It's not dangerous as fuck.  It's just fact.\nRightiesLackEmpathy: not really sure how you take that fact and use it to justify not having any morality at all, essentially. to you, even though the ability to suffer is far more complex and thus meaningful for a human vs a cell, you shouldn't have any opinion because the universe evidently doesn't care about anything and is just physics run amok. \n\n\nyou can be that sort of person who doesn't have any principles of his own, using the callousness of the universe as justification for why you don't join other humans in their fight against the elements, but it just makes you no better than the rest of the rabble who put their head down and ignore the problems of the world\n[deleted]: Who says the \"ability to suffer\" is complex?    \n\n\nIgnore the problems of the world ---- you're the one claiming all living things are less valuable than a single human life, not me.\nRightiesLackEmpathy: actually...no. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that the ability to suffer is paramount. if a bison can suffer, it has enough value to deserve a life without suffering just like humans. humans just have more complex brains, so their ability to perceive and comprehend makes their suffering greater in magnitude.\n\n\nI mentioned the human vs cell because that is the biggest know disparity between organisms in terms of nervous and comprehensional development. humans also evolved specifically to feel emotions because it allowed for better societal cohesion if someone felt things and wasn't a sociopathic monster. our very species is evolved, as are many others to variously lesser degrees, to feel and suffer for a specific biological reason. cells do not have these evolved attributes, they all evolved into directions where they essentially amount to chemical robots which seek different chemical concentrations in its environment\n[deleted]: SO you get to decide that the ability to experience some level of sensory input (suffering is one) is what makes a living thing worthy of being alive?  \n\n\nBTW -- suffering is the basis for most religions.  Humans are supposed to suffer htis life (if you believe that shit).\nRightiesLackEmpathy: I don't get to decide anything. no one gets to decide anything. you decide for yourself, and that's all we humans can do. we perceive reality subjectively, we will never see the true truth, whatever that may be. \n\n\nbut I don't think it makes something unworthy of life if they can't suffer, but rather that it makes them unworthy of moral consideration. makes them unworthy of being protected at all, especially not worth being protected against a human trying to like, wash their hands or take antibiotics\n[deleted]: True truth?  Oh please.  If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound if no one is there to hear it?  You can subjectively decide whether or not that sound is loud based on your evaluation but the \"true truth\" has nothing to do with your perception of reality.    \n\n\nI think the right might not be the only ones who lack empathy.\nRightiesLackEmpathy: empathy requires that the other organism has any ability to feel. the only way to feel empathy for a bacteria is to stop thinking, to match how it doesn't think at all.\n[deleted]: No - empathy has nothing to do with the other organism.  It's about you.  Not to mention that you're deciding that a bacterium can't \"think\" whatever that means.    \n\n\nYou've shown your own lack of empathy for other humans who have chosen to be unvaccinated and have died.  So why is that?  Did he not have the ability to feel?\nRightiesLackEmpathy: I find it humorous that you've been posting literally all day but didn't respond to me here. \n\n\nwhy did you say empathy has nothing to do with the other organism? that's literally the point of empathy. that's the objective, indisputable definition of empathy. to share the feelings of another. you can't share something with someone if they don't have anything to share...\n\n\n...........I think I know why you didn't reply actually\n[deleted]: Uh oh -- a stalker who's feeling left out.  \n\n\nWait -- so you know that some other organism has \"nothing to share\"?

{"full_text": "Axe_Ragnarok1: CMV: Dr. Strange, Multiverses of Madness used the Illuminati to push social justice down our throats.\nDuring the scene with Wanda confronting the Illuminati, several themes stood out;  \n- The Angry black man was effectively jailed and cast aside (but not killed).  Killing black men = bad.  (I am a black male)\n- the three cis-gender white males were rendered useless and quickly killed (its ok to kill cis-gender white males).  **Its not ok\n- and the only reason the two women were beaten is because a more capable woman was doing the beating.  \n\nNow, I know that comic books have addressed social issues as early as X-men, maybe before as well.  In these comics, Magneto and Xavier represented Malcolm X and Dr. King Jr respectively.  While the X-men represented disenfranchised groups based on their genetics.  It\u2019s because of this knowledge that I see how the MCU is currently driving the current social justice narrative.\nSlinkusmalinkus: What is \"the current social justice narrative\"? My understanding of Disney's Marvel products is that they are intended to reach the widest possible audiences and more likely to be playing to those preferences. Is \"the current social justice narrative\" just a way of referring to the broadest set of tastes as possible?\n\nWhy do you phrase it as \"shoving down our throats\"? Were you somehow forced to purchase the product?\nAxe_Ragnarok1: I don\u2019t have an issue with appeal to a wider audience.  That just means more movies. Good for us.  \nAnd no, I wasn\u2019t forced to purchase a ticket.  But if you take into account what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m forced to view these characters in a way that doesn\u2019t feel representative of how I know them.\nSlinkusmalinkus: Can you explain what \"the current social justice narrative\" means or have you changed your view in dropping this point?\n\n&gt;But if you take into account what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m forced to view these characters in a way that doesn\u2019t feel representative of how I know them.\n\nHow are you being forced?\nAxe_Ragnarok1: With regard to the post, SJ narrative;\n- cis gender white males are incompetent \n- women are great and can/ should only lose to a greater woman.\n\nIve changed my view of how a few characters were represented compared to my expectations, namely Xavier.  But not necessarily with regards to the ladies.  \n\nI can say that I probably wouldn\u2019t have this perspective if all the men weren\u2019t rendered useless, or killed at the start of the fight.  If, for example, Reed were able to contribute more to the fight, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve had this view.\nSlinkusmalinkus: This one film defines \"the current social justice narrative\"?\nAxe_Ragnarok1: No, I didn\u2019t say this one film defines the current narrative.  Im talking about the scene with Wanda vs Illuminati.\nSlinkusmalinkus: I was asking you to define \"the current social justice narrative\" and the definition you gave was recounting the scene which gave me the impression that your definition was contingent on this film rather than a frame of reference for your analysis of the film.\n\nPlease correct me where I have misunderstood.\nAxe_Ragnarok1: Current Social justice issues involve; Race, gender, age, and sexual orientation.  In this case, I'm not addressing sexual orientation or age. Gender inequality is the main driver, with race being secondary.\n\nSocial justice is invoked today while reinterpreting historical figures, in this case, Marvel heros.\n\nWith regard to gender; Gender inequality is being addressed by making one gender appear superior to another.  i.e. Cpt. Carter is reinterpreted as greater than Reed Richards.\n\nAs I mentioned before, all the males in the illuminati, except the old man, (I know Prof. X is more than an \"old man\", but you wouldn't know that from watching this) were killed first.  If gender inequality wasn't being tied to this, at least one of the fellas could have at least contributed.\n\nBut if that happened, would I have this perspective?  I don't think I would.\nSlinkusmalinkus: &gt;Current Social justice issues involve; Race, gender, age, and sexual orientation.  In this case, I'm not addressing sexual orientation or age.

Carter is reinterpreted as greater than Reed Richards.\n\nHow does making one gender appear superior to the other address gender inequality? On that note, why would one woman character being superior to one man character indicate that the gender category \"woman\" is superior to the gender category \"man\"?\n\n&gt;As I mentioned before, all the males in the illuminati, except the old man, (I know Prof. X is more than an \"old man\", but you wouldn't know that from watching this) were killed first. \n\nHow does the death of some male characters indicative of a normative gender equality message?\n\n&gt;If gender inequality wasn't being tied to this, at least one of the fellas could have at least contributed.\n\nWhy would the existence of some useless male characters indicate a normative gender equality message?\n\n&gt;But if that happened, would I have this perspective?  I don't think I would.\n\nSo this film ran contrary to your expectations about gender roles in film/cinema/comic book movies and also ran contrary to your expectations regarding the relative strengths of characters of different gender categories, and on that basis you feel that the film was shoving/forcing a gender equality narrative down your throat? Am I understanding correctly?\nAxe_Ragnarok1: Im speaking specifically to how these characters were represented; comics vs movies.  The expectations were set by the comics and previous movies.  So yes, the expectations are contrary to previously set expectations. \n\nHence \u201creinterpreted \u201c\nSlinkusmalinkus: Okay. The problems I see with your view are twofold:\n\n1. Nothing about what you've said is particularly compelling evidence for the presence of a gender (in)equality theme.\n\n2. Even if it were the case that there was a gender (in)equality theme, we still circle back to this unresolved problem of what exactly is shoving this film or theme down your throat or forcing you to watch it.\nAxe_Ragnarok1: &gt;Nothing about what you've said is particularly compelling evidence for the presence of a gender (in)equality theme.\n\nI'm making a couple assumptions.  \n\n\\- The first assumption is that you've seen this movie, as we are discussing said movie.  \n\n\\- The other assumption I'm making, although possibly inaccurately for most, is that you're familiar with the previous movies and shows; Iron Man through Avengers Endgame, Disney+ shows, X-men movies, Fantastic 4 movies\n\nWithin the time of these films and shows, it can be argued that the ladies haven't been represented as effectively  as the men.  The examples of powerful female characters was either poorly presented, (Cpt. Marvel, Phoenix), or not presented at all.   That began to change with WandaVision.  Wanda was finally being represented much more in line with her comics version.  This was a good thing.\n\nCaptain Carter was recently introduced in \"What if\".  Here, she was shown to be more capable than Steve Rogers, as she had previous military training, and was rather confident and capable right out of the gate.  Ok, I'll buy it for the sake of lack of time for character development.  What if was only 30 min episodes.\n\nMy issue is this:  Wanda was more than capable of destroying all the Illuminati as presented.  By rights, all things being equal, she could have destroyed them all in record time. \n\nBut that's not how it played out.  The men were rendered helpless, and killed first.    Why was this the direction of the fight?  The ladies, Cpt. Carter and Cpt. Marvel where able to fight her off for quite a while, comparatively.  Was this because they were more capable than the members that have been killed?  \n\nFrom my perspective, its because they were women.  Not because they were more capable.  These characters have been reinterpreted to show that these women were better than the men, for no reason other than they are women.  \n\nThe social justice narrative I'm speaking of works to highlight how much better women are than men.  One gender being shown to be greater than the other gender is inequality.  Women &gt; Men.  That's the definition of inequality.\nSlinkusmalinkus: What I am saying is that your argument for reading a social justice narrative onto the film is not compelling.\n\nYou can keep reiterating it, but for it to be compelling you would have to develop it.\n\n&gt;The social justice narrative I'm speaking of works to highlight how much better women are than men.\n\nHow is that a social justice narrative? It's not critiquing inequality or giving a normative position for equality?\n\n&gt;The men were rendered helpless, and killed first. Why was this the direction of the fight?\n\nThe scene could also be described as: \n\n*Supporting characters are killed off to focus on a showdown between a smaller cast of main characters that have been with us for longer.*\n\nWhy should your reading be taken as more compelling?\n\nAlso: You also still haven't addressed who or what is shoving this stipulated narrative down your throat or forcing you to watch it.\nAxe_Ragnarok1: I can agree that what I posted left much to be desired in its presentation.  I see the characters represented quite a bit differently than expected and have changed my view based on an updated perspective presented by a few other comments.  \n\nI also agree that due to the way I presented the idea, how it was \u201cshoved down throats \u201c wasn\u2019t presented effectively.  \n\nI appreciate this discussion with you in particular, as it helped me realize I could have developed my ideas a bit better in the OP, prior to posting.  Thank you\nSlinkusmalinkus: PS hit me with that delta if you feel I changed your view.\nAxe_Ragnarok1: I don\u2019t really think you changed my view of my post.  You did help me realize I needed to develop the idea, but thats not what I asked for my view to be changed on.  I did need to clarify, but you asked me to explain those to you. \n\nThe perspectives that changed my view where better perspective presented of the characters, with respect to my previous expectations.  I don\u2019t think our discussion resulted in you offering a better perspective from what I had.  \n\nI wanted to award a delta, and perhaps you could\u2019ve changed my view, if I had presented my view better.\nSlinkusmalinkus: &gt;I don\u2019t think our discussion resulted in you offering a better perspective from what I had.  \n\nSo you still believe it makes more sense to view it as conspiratorial social justice boogieman choices rather than mass appeal and storytelling choices?\nAxe_Ragnarok1: I view the interactions of the characters differently than I did when watching initially.

After that even passive hangs seemed to much for me, I felt my left hand was supporting most of my weight. I felt so weak and so powerless because of my injury.

If the injury was permanent, how did you manage accepting being limited by your own body ?\n\nPlus another question : how important is the pinky in grip strengh ?

It sounds like there was a lot of trauma to that area. Tendons and things take a long time to fully heal. Just keep working the grip in your injured hand. Think about adjusting how you grip as well. Maybe a hook type grip will work better than the bar type grip?\n\nAlso, the pinky provides relatively little in grip strength, more for stability.\ndariargos: yup, there was a lot of trauma. My middle finger was injured too but I was lucky the damage was superficial.\n\nOne aspect that difficult for me was that I didn't felt that my fourth finger tendon was that damaged : for the pinky it was obvious, I couldn't move it anymore but I could still move my fourth finger fine. So when the surgeon told me they had to open up the finger to stitch back the tendon I didn't understand. Now that the wound has healed up, I guess that one part of me thought that the tendon was okay too...\n\nThe hook grip seems very interesting ! I'll give it a go when I have a bar to train on again.

You want to cut pay to cut costs? Start with your own, it's the biggest part of the wage cost.\nWheream_I: &gt;especially considering their own pay is often substantially more costly than all their employees combined.\n\nUmm what? If you spend literally a single second, just 1, thinking about that statement and doing some incredibly basic math, you\u2019d see that that comment is incredibly not true.\nRandyHoward: Maybe you would like to explain your stance? Because I don't see how it's not true most of the time. I've been an executive in a business, I know first-hand how much executive pay costs a company vs. employee pay. So please, enlighten us as to why you believe that isn't true.\nWheream_I: In 2018, Jim Hackett, CEO of Ford, made $17.75mil in total compensation. \n\nAs of Dec 2018 Ford has 199,000 employees. 17,750,000/199000=$89. So unless every single other employee at Ford is only making $89/yr, no, executive comp doesn\u2019t account for a higher number than lower level comp.\n\nLet\u2019s assume these 199,000 employees work 32 hours per week, on average (some will be at 40, some less, let\u2019s say it averages 32). $7.25x32x52x199,000=2,400,736,000. If every single employee is literally only making minimum wage. 2,400,736,000/17,750,000=135.2. So for this example, Ford would have to pay every single one of its employees national minimum wage, average under 40 hours/week for them, AND pay 135 executives 17.75 mil/yr, for executive compensation and company comp to be in parity. That\u2019s not even \u201chave executive outweigh all other comp\u201d like you said. This is just to be EQUAL.\n\nLike I said, some basic as fuck math.\nRandyHoward: First of all, you're citing a single company. Do you know how many companies exist that are nowhere near as large as Ford? Second of all, you're comparing one single executives pay to all employees. That's not what we're discussing. How much is the total executive pay compared to all employees? Your math is way off base because you're comparing one executive to all employees, which was never my argument.\n\nSure, you're doing some basic as fuck math, but your variables are all wrong.\nice109: Even if I agree with you the person responded did approximate that it would take 135 executives not one\nRandyHoward: And as I said, Ford is a single company. Ford is also full of employees that are unionized. Try running the same math for a company that doesn't have a union sticking up for its employees.\nice109: &gt;Second of all, you're comparing one single executives pay to all employees. That's not what we're discussing. How much is the total executive pay compared to all employees? Your math is way off base because you're comparing one executive to all employees, which was never my argument.\n\nMost of the words in your comment are about \"one executive\". Maybe they edited their comment after you responded but as it stands they do respond to that part of your criticism.\nRandyHoward: &gt; Most of the words in your comment are about \"one executive\"\n\nI never said one executive. Reread the comment, then reread the whole thread and you'll find yet another comment where I show another redditor how to have some damn reading comprehension. You think that because someone provided some math that they're right, and I've even gone on to explain how their math is wrong in other comments. They've also cherry-picked a single company, one that employs hundreds of thousands of people, who are also unionized, which is very much not the norm when you look at all businesses on the whole. I did not state that it is universally true that executive pay is always higher than employee pay, I stated that it was often the case. If someone wants to go cherry-pick a company to refute my argument, well go right ahead, but you're only looking at an example of one of those companies that it isn't true for, primarily for two reasons: 1) They employ hundreds of thousands of people, and 2) Their workforce is unionized.

This is only inefficient if you presuppose that the goal of your life is to generate as much economic activity as possible; regardless of what the system you live in is.\nWoollyManmoth: Maybe I'm not as careful with my words as I should be, but by market economy I'm thinking of competition to produce profits. This system is conducive to life-consuming busyness when we consider that any person can only access the means of life through by participating in the labor market and that most people find esteem in the work that they do. \nMELBOT87: &gt;This system is conducive to life-consuming busyness when we consider that any person can only access the means of life through by participating in the labor market and that most people find esteem in the work that they do.\n\nThe market is merely a process by which individuals make choices regarding their own lives. Some people choose professions that make lots of money, like doctors or investment bankers, whereas others choose jobs that make less money but provide alternative benefits like more time with family.\n\nYour characterization of the market is a fallacy. It is merely a process whereby people can express their choices any way they want. Your fallacy is most popular when discussing economic inequality - a great amount of which can be explained by people's choices.\nWoollyManmoth: Your characterization of my position is a fallacy. The fact that you conflated a market and an economy says all too much. Markets have almost always existed, and they do let us express certain choices and obtain certain means of subsistence. However, only very recently has the market been the sole principle of production and distribution for an entire society. In this way, the market as we know it is not as much of an opportunity as much as it is an *imperative* - it is the mediator to all of our means of subsistence. And we participate in the market economy through competing in the labor market. Every individual must be involved in the competition for the means to subsistence. If you find esteem in doing well or obtaining things, this can keep you frightfully busy. This situation is unknown in previous economies, and imposes new limits on people's freedoms.\n\nYour fallacy is most common with people who are foregin to the study of certain histories or suffer from a teleological bias - a great amount of which can be explained by people's inability to tell which parts of their worldview they've merely inherited and/or are biased. \nMELBOT87: &gt;The fact that you conflated a market and an economy says all too much.\n\nI said specifically that market is a process. I did not conflate it with an economy. The market is the process by which people make economic decisions.\n\n&gt;However, only very recently has the market been the sole principle of production and distribution for an entire society.\n\nUh no. It is just that economic factors can be quantified whereas non-economic factors cannot. There isn't a way to quantify time spent with your family or playing video games versus earning income. It is only revealed through the actual choices people make. \n\n&gt;In this way, the market as we know it is not as much of an opportunity as much as it is an imperative - it is the mediator to all of our means of subsistence.\n\nAs opposed to *what*? Finished goods falling from the sky? Using our imagination? The market provides incentives for people to actually produce. Absent those incentives, then people will not take entrepreneurial risk and they will not produce. That is the purpose of the profit motive.\n\n&gt;Every individual must be involved in the competition for the means to subsistence.\n\nlol again - as opposed to *what*? Getting shit for free?\n\n&gt;This situation is unknown in previous economies, and imposes new limits on people's freedoms.\n\nWhat utter nonsense. Previous economies suffered from a lack of capital and technology. 98% of the population worked on subsistence farming before the industrial revolution. Are you saying people were \"free\" when they had to work on a farm and hope for a good harvest?\n\n\nWoollyManmoth: &gt;Uh no. It is just that economic factors can be quantified\n\nPrevious economies operated on a different logic. Communities of various sorts produced for use and various hierarchical systems and social relations dictated how goods were redistributed. Markets existed, but only as fragemented forms of trading opportunities between communities, most of which sustained themselves, or for luxuries if you're pretty wealthy. The current logic is different; each individual must make profit via the market.\n\n&gt;As opposed to what?\n\nProduction for use as opposed to production for profit, but that's the only one I know.\n\n&gt;Absent those incentives, then people will not take entrepreneurial risk \n\n[Some will disagree](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)  The profit icentive is an invention, and we produced alright for a long time before that. It's in place now perhaps because the social framework we're born into gives us almost no alternative.\n\n&gt;Previous economies suffered from a lack of capital and technology.\n\nAssuming that the present situation was the end goal of previous economies and its history is only the overcoming of obstacles is to impose a teleology on the past. Are you a creationist by chance? There were economies more commercially developed and technologically capable than England before the Industrial Revolution began, but these economies not develop the market economy we know. \n\n&gt;Are you saying people were \"free\"\n\nNo one's really free. We all accept certain goods at the acceptance of certain limitations, but I'm not making the argument that the past was superior either.\nMELBOT87: &gt;Previous economies operated on a different logic.\n\nA logic dictated by tremendous scarcity and poverty. Through markets, efficiencies created abundance. \n\n&gt;Communities of various sorts produced for use and various hierarchical systems and social relations dictated how goods were redistributed.\n\nUsually through violent feudal systems that provided for the rich at the expense of everyone else.\n\n&gt;The current logic is different; each individual must make profit via the market.\n\nWhich makes sense when everyone has economic and political liberty and make decisions regarding their own lives. \n\n&gt;Some will disagree\n\nIf people disagree than they can operate in that manner without depriving others of operating under a different incentive structure. That is what freedom and markets are about. If you want to farm tomatoes and that is all that you want to do in life and that is all that will make you happy - you are free to do it. If I prefer to be a lawyer and try to make more money, than that is my choice and I am free to do it. As long as you do not infringe on my right to pursue my interests and I don't infringe on your right to pursue your interests - then we can live harmoniously.\n\n&gt;The profit icentive is an invention, and we produced alright for a long time before that.\n\nIt is not an invention - it is quite natural. People respond to incentives. Profit is one form of incentive. What profits actually are are signals. They signal that sum of the resources used is greater than the cost of securing those individual resources. It sends a signal that someone is using resources in a way that people demand. A loss, as a corollary, signals that people are using resources wastefully - that the economic costs are greater than the value created.\n\n&gt;It's in place now perhaps because the social framework we're born into gives us almost no alternative.\n\nBut you are free to operate outside of that if you want. It hasn't always  worked this way as you stated above. It works that way now because people like to have abundant food and electricity and the such. For people who prefer not to have those things, they can find a different system.\n\n&gt;Assuming that the present situation was the end goal of previous economies and its history is only the overcoming of obstacles is to impose a teleology on the past.\n\nA valid assumption. People want food. People want electricity. People want homes. People want cars. Know how I know this? Because when given the choice, many people choose it. It is revealed through their actions. Not everyone wants this. There is a small few who don't. But that doesn't change the fact that a great majority of people prefer abundance to poverty.\n\n&gt;Are you a creationist by chance?\n\nFar from it.\n\n&gt;There were economies more commercially developed and technologically capable than England before the Industrial Revolution began, but these economies not develop the market economy we know.\n\nSo? Economies were mercantilist and imperialist. Their economic power came from domination of both resources and people. Once industry increased production, the average person could enjoy the luxuries.\nWoollyManmoth: It's not true that the evolution from pre-market economies to market economies is a matter of having abundant goods.\nMELBOT87: No - it is a *consequence*. You may know a lot of philosophy, but you don't know a whole lot about economics. The industrial revolution led to the greatest increase in real wages and standard of living in human history. It came about because capital made labor more productive. Increased agricultural production meant that less people needed to farm to feed the populace (at one point 98% of the population were in agriculture - now 2% feed the other 98%). This freed up labor for industrial work which allowed for the mass production of goods. Simple items we take for granted like clothes, furniture, heat became abundant and available to the common person because of these principles. Because individuals sought profit. \n\nProfitable enterprises signal to the market that resources are being used wisely. It signals investors to invest more capital in that industry and it entices entrepreneurs to enter into the industry to compete and capture those profits. Then, through competition quality goes up and prices come down. \n\nThe market is merely the process by which individuals make economic decisions regarding what goods or services they prefer relative to all the other goods and services available. That is why government interventions in the market often fail to produce desired results. Because government policy cannot change reality, it can only alter incentives. But politicians and bureaucrats cannot anticipate all of the unintended consequences of their actions. For instance, price controls lead to shortages. They set the price below where supply and demand intersect and it causes the product to be priced below its actual market value. It also destroys the incentive to produce more in order to capture higher profits.\nWoollyManmoth: So your stance is that the transition from pre-market economy to market economy is a matter of increased productivity through technology, or at least primarily technology? And this increased productivity overcame the obstacles necessary to obtain a market economy, which is the natural progression for any economy with the resources to do so?

{"full_text": "jimmio92: A/C unit timer board failed; replacement also failed; made my own\nI have a Carrier A/C unit outside my house here. It had a timer board that would delay the start of the compressor from when the thermostat signaled for it by about 5 seconds or so.\n\nI bought a new board, it also did not work correctly.. but that's because this part has been replaced by Carrier by a different part, and this was an Amazon seller.. so the part was bad.\n\nSo... I made my own. I could have spent way more time on the the case, but I just shoved it into a TicTac container after making sure exposed pins were taped up.\n\nHVAC \"signal\" is 24VAC. 24VAC to a full bridge rectifier gives me about 22V DC. Into a 100uF 50V capacitor (all I had unfortunately), then into an LM2596 based buck converter module, then into the VIN on an Arduino Nano I had laying around. Nano digital pin 2 to a cheapo 5V relay module (transistor to switch it on, freewheeling diode to prevent voltage spike on coil power off, and relay 5V relay) that switches that 24VAC to the contactor that connects 240VAC mains to the compressor/cooling fan/start-run capacitor.\n\nEntirely overkill as the timer doesn't seem needed at all... but now I can adjust this delay. Supposedly this means I could delay it for 20 minutes... if the house temp doesn't come down in that amount of time, fire the A/C. Circulating the air is sometimes enough, after all.\n\nBut for now it's set for 30 seconds as I wasn't really sure what a good value would be, and if it doesn't turn on at the same time as the blower fan, the overall house load is less, so the voltage should be higher on compressor start, also helping the aging beast continue running.\n\nPhotos at: https://imgur.com/a/wfKqdkf\nineedaneasybutton: You wasted a lot of time and money to be honest. These are very common and replace OEM boards all of the time. They only lack the current sensing soem OEM boards have.\n\nhttps://www.grainger.com/product/ICM-Time-Delay-Delay-on-Break-4E234\n\nStandard delay is 3-5 minutes by the way.\nstealthybutthole: The 3-5 minute delay you're referring to is built into the thermostat.\nfrosty95: Only on modern / good thermostats. Which is why they have the board. Yes with a good thermostat though you could bypass the board.\nineedaneasybutton: And destroy your compressor with something as simple as cottonwood season clogging the coil over one weekend.\n\nPlease stop recommending people bypass compressor protection that takes place after the stat.\nfrosty95: I didn't recommend it. Just saying it would eliminate the need for that functionality. And most boards don't do current or temp monitoring so a clogged coil would still trip the thermal overload of the compressor.\nineedaneasybutton: Thermal overload is the last safety to protect your compressor. It protects from temp only. Res techs thinking a thermal will always protect the compressor... They must last forever cause they have a thermal overload that always works.\n\nI've seen the internal relief blow and not reset before the thermal tripped. I went to an 06E that pumped all its oil out and not trip oil pressure because it was bypassed, comp locked. There's 100s of situations where the thermal will not save your compressor.\n\nNow if your coil is clogged chances are you'll notice it hot in your house and if you bypassed the CLO the compressor goes out on thermal. Not everytime.\nfrosty95: Not sure why you decided to wiki explain a thermal overload to me? Also not sure why you are talking about commercial units with oil pumps? I also never said going off on overload was ok? Anyways.... Again. Most residential units are not measuring current or temp. My point was only that yes a thermostat can serve a similar functionality to a basic startup timer lockout board. Am I wrong?\nineedaneasybutton: &gt;similar functionality to a basic startup timer lockout board.\n\nBecause you are telling people this and it is not true and the hack jobs done by people saying this cost people money.\n\nThe thermostat prevents short cycling from cooling/heating calls only. The lock out timer prevents all short cycling.\n\nMost res units are measuring pressure.\nfrosty95: That's no longer a basic lockout board. What part of basic are you failing to understand? Clearly if it has pressure controls what I said is no longer applicable.\nineedaneasybutton: You literally have no clue what you're talking about. I even linked a delay on break timer elsewhere which is the most basic lock out there is. **Almost all res units in use have pressure cut outs**.\n\nA basic lock out board or timer delays the contactor from pulling in if the 24v is broken from pressure, from calls, from power disruption. If it is broken for any reason.\n\nThere are plenty of res units that have current sensing. Sorry if I used CLO as general compressor lock out and not just current sensing lock out. The terms are used interchangably often where I am.\nfrosty95: I saw two in the last week with no pressure cutouts lol. Many units simply don't have them around here. Guess that makes me an idiot.\nineedaneasybutton: I said almost all, not all. Many of those have no high pressure cut out. That doesn't change anything about what I said.

These 3 bureaus allow you to \"freeze\" your reports, so that nobody can look at them and therefore nobody can take credit out in your name. This process must be done separately for the 3 bureaus and takes about 5 minutes each.\nSmartass_Narrator: Please, please, PLEASE understand that if you freeze your credit (which is just fine if that\u2019s what you want to do) then *everything* you apply for will be declined, including credit limit increase requests on your cards or new card applications. Don\u2019t get mad at the company for the decline. Freezing credit is usually done because of ID theft or concerns so if that freeze is on a report, it\u2019s an automatic decline, no ifs ands or buts. Should you decide you want an increase or a new card or loan, you have to unfreeze everything *first* and *then* apply. Give it a cycle (a full day) to clear just to be safe so there\u2019s not overlap between systems. I can\u2019t tell you how often I\u2019ve seen people livid about being declined for something despite their great credit score and then say yes when I ask if they\u2019ve ever frozen their credit followed by no when I ask if they ever unfroze it.\ntazmologist: I would argue that a byproduct of freezing your credit is that you have to be more thoughtful in it's use.  If you have to unfreeze before you apply for a credit card or an increase, you will take at least a moment to say \"Do I really need to do this\"?  At least that has worked for me and improved my credit score by 200 points in the last 2 years in the process.\nGoodAbbreviations164: I had my credit frozen for a few years.  It was great when you go to places like TJMaxx and they want you to apply for their card to save X% off today's purchase.  I just tell them my credit is frozen and they drop it.   It makes saying \"no\" much easier.  \n\nBut yes, when I was trying to get a car loan after my car had been totalled, it did add an extra layer of inconvenience trying to get that unfrozen for the day so they could inquire about my credit.    I am in the middle of a lot of change in my life, so when it's all back to boring every day is the same type of life, I will probably refreeze it.\nSmartass_Narrator: Yeah it\u2019s tough cuz the company can\u2019t even tell you upfront that the reason you\u2019re declined is because of a freeze. Logically, the consumer should know about the freeze and If it\u2019s frozen it means the person applying *could* be the baddie and not the actual person (who should know about the freeze\u2026. But maybe they forgot! So many variables!). The lender don\u2019t know! It\u2019s hard on everyone! So\u2026 decline. Better safe than sorry.

Like paying extra for a gluten free hair cut, or boneless chocolate bar. \n\nI had a friend forget her razor on vacation, I had forgotten mine as well and bought the generic 6 pack of them from a drug store.  I gave her one and mentioned it wasn't a big deal since it only cost a couple bucks for all of them.

As far as I know she's been buying the less expensive generic \"men's\" razors ever since.\n\nIf some one want's to pay that much more for something because it's a different color or claims to before their gender it's on them. \nPreExistingAmbition: So, I'm guessing you didn't read the article because it's specifically mentions that women will pay more on their dry-cleaning. This is not a choice they can make in choosing a prettier product or a \"gluten free haircut\". Yes, women can choose not to buy pink razors but the problem goes beyond hygiene products. \nmischief88: I did in fact, and while I don't know the in's and outs of a dry cleaning business I would imagine a fancy blouse is going to cost the same as a basic shirt.  Has there been research into these \"sexist\" dry cleaners?  Can a woman drop it off and say it's a shirt and will she still be charged more?  If I as a man drop it off and even say it's a blouse, mine and not one belonging to a friend or spouse for that matter do I get a discount? \nPreExistingAmbition: The dry cleaning is an example of something that women cannot simply choose to buy cheaper. If women are charged more because their clothes is different fabrics, shapes, or complexity to clean then price adjustments are understood and should be communicated clearly to customers.\n\nBut this is not solely the issue. According to the research study, cited in the article, the following are examples of \"pink tax\" or \"idiot tax\" as you call it...\n\n7 percent more for toys and accessories\r\n4 percent more for children\u2019s clothing\r\n8 percent more for adult clothing \r\n13 percent more for personal care products\r\n8 percent more for senior/home health care products\n\nmischief88: I don't see why any of these items won't work or have a less fancy equivalent.  The only thing I could see have any source of traction is women's health vitamins, or feminine hygiene products.  I'm assuming a little girls dress is going to be fancier and cost slightly more than a boy's t-shirt with a foot ball printed on.  The same thing goes for the fancier fabric/cut blouses that they're choosing to buy.  Once again would any one even be able to notice if a woman were to use a men's shampoo, conditioner, or deodorant?  \n\nYou can complain and raise awareness all you want, but if you go out and spend 13% more on a product, even if you bitch about it online afterwards, the company made their money off you and will continue to do so until they don't make money.\n\n\"Hey, no ones buying these pink razors any more that we had to charge more for because we only sell 1/5th the amount and still have to shut down the line and change over the dye's and packaging for, thus decreasing our profit margin.

I'm all for buying the cheapest razor, regardless of color. When it comes to deodorant, scents can be pretty gender specific. Women typically don't want to smell like brut and men typically don't want to smell like sparkling roses. It gets harder to avoid buying things when scent is involved.\nClothes is another unavoidable expense. While a woman could wear a tailored 3 piece suit, which is a small fortune itself, some employers and schools require dresses and skirts. \nmischief88: I'll let you have that one because I've never done shopping for a dress or skirt (although the private school I went to gave girls the option to wear skirts, but also allowed them to wear slacks and a polo the same as the guys did).  I just find it hard to believe they're noticeably more expensive if not making an effort to dress impressive.  \n\nOn the same note as wearing a more expensive dress or blouse just to work to look nice I know girls who will do their make up every day just to go walk the dog or even sit around the house and do nothing (probably spending a small fortune on it), spending this extra money to feel pretty.  Besides the marketing done to convince them they need to, is no fault of the manufacture for what they spend on it. \n\nOnce again it's if I have to go buy the \"Big manly V8 muscle car to be a successful alpha male\"  instead of realizing my less flashy economy version of the same car will get me around just fine. \n", "prompt": "PreExistingAmbition: Burger King is doing their part to fight against the \"Pink Tax\"; putting pressure on lawmakers to pass legislation against charging women more than men for products and services.\n\nmischief88: I hate to call this an \"Idiot tax\" and offend women but that's what it seems to be in most cases.

{"full_text": "calm_Bunny21: will this really work?\n\ndavidevitali: It\u2019s legit. The water goes in the bottle, the air in the bottle can\u2019t get out so it get compressed, when he opens the front valve the compressed air within  the bottle pushes the water out. How long it lasts depend on the valve aperture / original water flow ratio\n-domi-: The air pressure in the bottle can't be more than the tap pressure of the water (otherwise the air would escape the bottle, instead of the water entering the bottle). That bottle does nothing. The device works the exact same with and without it.\nrdrunner_74: The bottle does a LOT in this setup. It acts as a local pressure reservoir. Without the bottle, you get one \"short\" squirt, then the hose pressure is normalized. With the bottle you have some reserves. \n\nIt will run out slowly if you draw more than you supply\n-domi-: It really doesn't. It doesn't store any pressure, because the pressure of the water is equivalent to the tap pressure, when you open the tap fully. If it wasn't, then the waterline in the bottle would be moving and not stationary. And the jet at the nozzle is whatever that jet is at tap pressure. So, once you open the tap fully, then opening the control valve at the front of the pvc tube will result in the same jet with and without the water bottle.   \n\n\nIt's just a fake video, much like the ones showing perpetual motion devices, or free energy, etc. If this works, then you should totally scale the process up, and run a turbine on the magical free extra pressure you get, and drive a generator with the turbine, which produces free electricity. You could save humankind. Do it.\nrdrunner_74: It does allow you to store pressure. \n\nIt does not allow you to exceed the water pressure though.\n\nBut it compresses the water in the bottle to act as a \"spring\" - You draw more water then you can put in? The water level drops (With the pressure) until it slows down to \"a tickle\"\n\nYou pause a few seconds... the water level raises and the pressure builds back up.\n\nIt can not sustain any \"boosted\" output if it drops.\n\nIn contrast to a perpetuum mobile, this device operates by simple air presure, and it is not able to generate any extra pressure from nowhere. It is able to maintain a higher pressure longer because it adds a buffer tank that can be slowly drained. If the tank is empty, you wont be able to \"squeeze the hose together\" for more pressure like at the beginning. The pressure needs to build up inside the system (Input into the system is constrained by the flow rate of the water faucet).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsider it a pressure battery/capacitor. You can charge them with low incomming power, and later drain more in a short term from it (If resistances allow it).\n-domi-: What water level drop, it's connected to the tap? The water it stores is no different than having a longer hose - that stores water as well, right? The bottle does nothing. The video is staged pseudoscience cringe spam. I dunno what you're talking about, but i'm talking about the video i've commented to.  \n\n\nIn that video, the bottle does nothing. There is no air pressure, the pressure in the bottle is atmospheric before you compress it with the water from the tap, until both pressures are equal (and they become equal to the tap).\nrdrunner_74: The water level in the bottle. It is the pressure reservoir.\n\nWater comes in slow and steady. The bottle stores it (Accumulator)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic\\_accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_accumulator) Have a look at the section \"Compressed gas (or gas-charged) closed accumulator\" (We have no membrane here, since the geometry of the contraption takes care of that)\n-domi-: Water isn't coming in slowly, dude, it's attached to a tap. Unless the point of the invention is to go open the tap, shut the tap, then open the control valve, none of what you're talking about is working. What the video shows is \"free energy\" whereby some \"genius\" builds an amazing contraption which gives you a stronger water jet by putting a do-nothing bottle upstream of your nozzle. It's a sham.   \n\n\nYou're thinking about something completely different. Go watch the video, and appreciate how nothing of what you're talking about applies in this context.\nrdrunner_74: Where is free energy? \n\nIt is an accumulator. You consider a capacitator magic?\n\nYou dont get any water pressure right away. Much easier to block the hose with the bottle attached (Since now there is room to expand)\n-domi-: Did you watch the video? Are you sure you watched the video. Because when you open the tap, and then crack open the control valve behind the nozzle, the jet of water you will get is identical with and without the bottle attached. Go ahead and try it. Build this contraption at home, and you'll soon realize that the magic in the video is probably them opening the tap very little without the bottle attached, and a lot more with it attached.\nrdrunner_74: You wont get the same result, the accumulator will help you to stay at the ~~full~~    higher pressure longer. \n\nThe same reason is why you use a capacitor in an electric PSU. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompressed gas (or gas-charged) closed accumulator\r  \n\r  \nA bladder-type hydraulic accumulator. Fluid fills the internal rubber bladder which expands, compressing the air inside the sealed shell.\r  \n\r  \nFor low pressure water system use the water usually fills a rubber bladder within the tank (pictured), preventing contact with the tank which would otherwise need to be corrosion resistant. Units designed for high-pressure applications such as hydraulic systems are usually pre-charged to a very high pressure (approaching the system operating pressure) and are designed to prevent the bladder or membrane being damaged by this internal pressure when the system pressure is low. For bladder types this generally requires the bladder to be filled with the gas so that when system pressure is zero the bladder is fully expanded rather than being crushed by the gas charge. To prevent the bladder being forced out of the device when the system pressure is low there is typically either an anti-extrusion plate attached to the bladder that presses against and seals the entrance, or a spring-loaded plate on the entrance that closes when the bladder presses against it.\r  \n\r  \nIt is possible to increase the gas volume of the accumulator by coupling a gas bottle to the gas side of the accumulator. For the same swing in system pressure this will result in a larger portion of the accumulator volume being used. If the pressure does not vary over a very wide range this can be a cost effective way to reduce the size of the accumulator needed. If the accumulator is not of the piston type care must be taken that the bladder or membrane will not be damaged in any expected over-pressure situation, many bladder-type accumulators cannot tolerate the bladder being crushed under pressure.\r  \n\r  \nA compressed gas accumulator was invented by Jean Mercier\\[4\\] for use in variable-pitch propellers.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic\\_accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_accumulator)\n-domi-: Answer me straight:  \n1. Did you watch the video?  \n2. Do you understand how taps work?  \n3. Do you know what the pressure and capacity of a water tap is?  \n4. Are you literally just trolling at this point?\nrdrunner_74: 1. yes\n2. yes\n3. yes, Flow rate is approx 6-8l/min from that tap based on the video (takes from 1:15-1:25). I expect a maximum pressure of around 2 atm from their system based on the max water height of the bottle (Which is quite normal). Edit: Nozzle size is about 2.5-3mm\n4. No. This system is a small local accumulator. The fixed width of the nozzle also makes it much easier than the initial demo with the thumb.\n-domi-: Re: 3 - And the bottle does nothing to help with that pressure, all it can hope to do is even out some tiny fluctuations in tap pressure, but i honestly don't remember the last time i've experienced uneven tap pressure.  \n\n\nRe: 4 - Of course, but nothing changes if you remove the bottle.   \n\n\nSo, with those in mind, what does the bottle add by being a pressure accumulator? Help you maintain pressure for 2 more seconds if the water company cuts you off from the main? This is silly. The video is made to show you how the bottle magically creates pressure, which it doesn't. And you're stickling over a point which is perfectly irrelevant. Functionally, this whole contraption would work the same without the bottle, as far as the jet of water is concerned.\nrdrunner_74: The bottle does not \"create pressure\" - It stores the incoming energy to be released later. It can never exceed the maximum pressure of the water system. (Thats why it stops filling at \\~1:25 - the pressure normalized in the system). \n\nAlso with an empty bottle in the system you wont be able to do the \"Thumb trick\" from the beginning. It will provide an alternate location to go vs \"only out through a reduced nozzle\" \n\nIt depends on how much of a drain you put on the system so it can maintain it.\n\nI did some math to get the numbers for another reply. \n\nIf the company cuts you of, you are dead in 2 seconds yes. But you can exceed the amount you get from the system for \\~ 25% for 15 seconds (drain 10l/Min vs 8l/min - or 50% for 7.5 seconds) - Not much but it works for the last 20 seconds of a ticktok video ;) \n\nYou always gain the input from the local water system (8l/min).\nGhostley92: I just gotta commend the effort. \n\nrdrunner actually has an understanding, domi. Quit *your* trolling. \n\nIf the nozzle supplies more flow than the tap can, there will be a pressure drop to atmosphere that the compressed air will supplement for a short time. \n\nThis is about maintaining flow rate at *nearly* tap pressure. Not boosting pressure or making \u201cfree energy\u201d. This increases impingement.\nrdrunner_74: Thanks.\n\nSometimes crunching useless nunbers is fun.\n", "prompt": "calm_Bunny21: will this really work?\n\ndavidevitali: It\u2019s legit.

{"full_text": "What_the_what_show: What is a LightYear and How Far is it?\n\nsunnyday420: No this is wrong because there is no particle of light and you dont know what medium its propagating through also\nWhat_the_what_show: Would you mind explaining a little further? Thanks\nsunnyday420: So when light is propagating through a medium of water its going to be observed to travel 30% slower and when it leaves the water it speeds back up. So to calculate light you need to know the medium its propagating through. Which leads to how the medium of space is not an authentic medium, and the distances to the luminaries/stars are actually much closer than the failed calculations say. \n\nThen more importantly they are treating light as a particle AND a sound wave. This is false. There is no particle of light according to nikola tesla, he had an explanation as to why.. the background medium of ether that exists that enables the soundwave of light to propagate through. So that light is not an emission, its a perturbation in the ether!!\n\nWith this old way of how light functions which is closer to the truth, the speed of light as you know it is debunked\nWhat_the_what_show: Well, that\u2019s really interesting and I thank you for sharing it. If this is the case then why isn\u2019t it the norm?\nsunnyday420: Because what nikola tesla was teaching was too accurate and liberating in my opinion. Knowledge is power and to understand light would be too empowering. It could be weaponized and it liberate humanity and remove the wealth disparities. \n\nI appreciate you hearing me out because i get alot of bad reactions when i explain the ether. People think its outdated and debunked.\n\nSo the ether was called \"quintessence\" by the greek philosophers and \"prime material\" in alchemy. There are like hundreds of names for the ether in different cultures and everyone acknowledged it until 1915 with einsteins theory of relativity. \n\nIn his theory of relativity it gives you medium of dark matter and spacetime.

Do you not think it\u2019s logical that this has been done with ether? Many ideas of the Greeks were also mythology. Do you have some reference material you would recommend?\nsunnyday420: \"a picture can paint a thousand words\" so when ancient civilizations and greeks were using symbols and stories, you called it mythology. well turns out they were artfully describing the sky because the sky is really important. for example zues is jupiter.  the sumarians called it \"Dapinu\", or for the norse they called it thor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what you think are made up fantasy stories are actually describing the sky because the sky is really important. thats why they will spend so many resources faking space missions and stuff is to deceive you about what the sky really is. for only if you knew what the sky really was, it would empower you too much to be controlled.\n", "prompt": "What_the_what_show: What is a LightYear and How Far is it?\n\nsunnyday420: No this is wrong because there is no particle of light and you dont know what medium its propagating through also\nWhat_the_what_show: Would you mind explaining a little further? Thanks\nsunnyday420: So when light is propagating through a medium of water its going to be observed to travel 30% slower and when it leaves the water it speeds back up. So to calculate light you need to know the medium its propagating through. Which leads to how the medium of space is not an authentic medium,", "orig": "and the distances to the luminaries/stars are actually much closer than the failed calculations say. \n\nThen more importantly they are treating light as a particle AND a sound wave. This is false. There is no particle of light according to nikola tesla, he had an explanation as to why.. the background medium of ether that exists that enables the soundwave of light to propagate through. So that light is not an emission, its a perturbation in the ether!!\n\nWith this old way of how light functions which is closer to the truth, the speed of light as you know it is debunked\nWhat_the_what_show: Well", "generated": "I understand what you're getting at, sunnyday420. You're saying that the speed of light is not a fixed constant, but rather it depends on the medium it's traveling through. That's a great point, and it's a fundamental concept in physics. The speed of light in a vacuum is indeed a constant, approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, but as you mentioned, it can be affected by the properties of the medium it's traveling through. \n\nFor example, as you said, light travels slower through water due to the refraction of light caused by the density of the water molecules. Similarly,"}

It's flat, the roads are neatly designed in a grid and very wide, all the buildings adhere to the same dull color scheme, a large cookie-cutter design.

The sole purpose of the city is to serve as one giant plot of real-estate: residential and commercial. The thought of graduating from the college, working in one of the many office buildings in the area, and eventually buying a condo\u2026 In a superficial sense, it\u2019s very much the American dream. But Irvine is a city explicitly designed to afford this and only this. \n\nWork. Pay off your mortgage. Travel at the speed limit. Come to a full stop at stop signs. Occasionally dine at the Cheesecake Factory. Walk around the city\u2019s shiny outdoor shopping mall on the weekend. Maybe visit a park and watch the geese. Kiss your wife on the cheek. Go to bed. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe whole city is like a controlled experiment: one big exercise in compliance.\n\nI dunno man. I\u2019m in my thirties and not getting any younger.

It can be hard to determine norms and where people stand on things, and many often fall back to letting another person pick up in the conversation.

So many people don't listen. With your horizontal rows, are your legs straight or bent?

{"full_text": "EdgarGBasm: Is All Heterosexual Sex Rape?\nAs a personal note, this argument is somewhat radical, and I don't totally buy it since I think it relies on an unrealistically restricted view of what counts as consent. I also suspect exercises of power and coercion may differ in subtle ways, esp. considering in considering whether or not power was exercised successfully. But I think the argument is generally worth considering and can shed some clarity on the concepts involved.\n\n(1) Rape is any instance of non-consensual sexual activity.\n\n(2) All sexual activity between men and women is actually non-consensual. \n\n(3) All sexual activity between men and women is rape.\n\nAs far as I know, (1) is pretty uncontroversial, so (2) is pretty much load-bearing and needs substantial defense.\n\nMy defense of (2) is that there is a difference between nominal consent (eg, saying \"yes\") and actual consent, which has to do with the ability to make genuine choices, and that actual consent is not fully possible when there is a difference in power between the two parties. (Another way of saying this might be that we are not always in a *position* to consent when giving nominal consent).\n\nThat nominal consent is inadequate to fully capture our intuitions around consent should be apparent from considering several points.\n\n(1) Nominal consent does not really say much in extreme situations. If your grandmother is being held at gunpoint until you meet some demand of the gunman, your action can hardly be said to be *actually* consenting, even if you say \"yes\".\n\n(2) The only way to impair nominal consent is to become physically incapable of communicating. That nominal consent is tied *only* to the physical capability to communicate and not to preferences of the consenting agent fails entirely to capture what we mean when we talk about consent.\n\n(3) If someone is incapable of speaking, they may still be capable of consenting (although we'll have no way of knowing it).\n\nSo what we're really concerned with is *actual* consent, not nominal consent. However, actual consent is just not possible as long as there is unequal power between the putatively consenting parties. Actual consent requires the absence of coercion, but the existence of unequal power necessarily entails the exercise of power over the disempowered party, which is coercive. (See [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/247xgo/modal_logic_for_analyzing_power/ch4ld9w) and the parent post for a discussion of how a possible power entails an actualized power).\n\nFrom here:\n\n(1) If there is unequal power between two parties, actual consent is not possible.\n\n(2) Men always have power over women.\n\n(3) Therefore, between men and women actual consent is not possible.\n\nI understand (2) as the structural powers that we often refer to as patriarchy, not as any innate, necessary difference between men and women. Whether or not patriarchy exists is not an issue I intend to defend here; there are plenty of resources out there for those who are interested but unconvinced--though I think the events at UCSB and social media reactions should be pretty revealing to any doubters.\n\nThe load bearing premise now is (1). I see two obvious ways to treat power imbalances here: \n\n(1) if any party has *any* power over the other, then action is coerced and cannot be consensual\n\n(2) if any party has *net* power over the other, then action is coerced and cannot be consensual\n\nHowever, when there is a *net* difference in power between parties, it's suggested that *both* parties are exerting coercive force and thus neither can be actually consenting if actual consent entails complete (or at least nearly complete) absence of coercion; the parties here would *both* be subject to coercion. There's a brief discussion of the voluntary nature of consent and coercion available [here](http://www.iep.utm.edu/sexualit/#H17) with references for the interested.\n\n**tl;dr**:\n\n(1) If there is unequal power between two parties, consent is not possible.\n\n(2) Men always have power over women.\n\n(3) Therefore, between men and women consent is not possible.\n\n(4) Rape is any instance of non-consensual sexual activity.\n\n(5) Therefore, any sexual activity between men and women is rape.\nslickwombat: Needless to say, this all hinges upon the construal of consent. This notion of \"actual consent\" certainly renders (1) less intuitively obvious than it at first appears, as we can see if we sub in the definition:\n\n(1) Rape is any instance of sexual activity where one participant is more powerful than another. \n\n... which certainly isn't a definition I'd endorse. Surely something as condemnable as rape requires not merely *having* power, but also exercising it in some intentional and illicit way. \n\nMoreover, I don't think we can really use this construal of consent consistently. For example:\n\n1. Any business transaction between two parties requires the consent of both parties.\n2. If there is unequal power between two parties, consent is not possible.\n3. Men always have power over women.\n4. Therefore, it is not possible for men and women to conduct business transactions.\n\n\nEdgarGBasm: &gt; Surely something as condemnable as rape requires not merely having power, but also exercising it in some intentional and illicit way.\n\nThat's why I linked to that other post, which I think (with modest success) suggests how having power could entail exercising power. I think there's discussion going on elsewhere in this thread about whether exercising power is the same as coercion, which might get at the same intuition you're having.\n\nIf I were committed to this argument, I don't think the conclusion applied to business transactions is much more or less concerning than the conclusion applied to sex. It would already be *really bad* that heterosexual sex is always rape, because that'd be a *lot* of rape.\nslickwombat: &gt; That's why I linked to that other post, which I think (with modest success) suggests how having power could entail exercising power. \n\nUnfortunately, it being years since I looked at symbolic logic, that post is clear as mud to me. Just to respond to the dumb-people-example though:\n\n&gt;&gt;As a simple example, the possibility that the state could make me go to jail makes me not commit crimes, which implies that the state makes me not commit crimes.\n\nThat seems to be a case where the threat of power, even if it has not (yet) been exercised, is coercive. But of course, \"you must not commit a crime, or you will be punished\" is an explicit threat and an explicit attempt to coerce people to (not) do certain things. This is not the same as merely *having the power* to punish people. \n\nWere someone to analogously threaten someone with punishment as a way of forcing them to have sex, we'd pretty straightforwardly understand that to be rape even absent physical harm. But that's precisely because it involves a threat to harm, which is not at all implied by the mere ability to harm.\n\n&gt;If I were committed to this argument, I don't think the conclusion applied to business transactions is much more or less concerning than the conclusion applied to sex. It would already be really bad that heterosexual sex is always rape, because that'd be a lot of rape.\n\nDefinitely really bad, yet I think some extreme-minded folks might actually be okay with the idea of heterosexual sex as rape (or as generally condemnable). They might be less okay with the idea of women, or other putatively net-low-power groups, being literally unable to form consensual agreements with net-high-power ones. This would suggest, among other things, radical segregation, and/or the exclusion of some groups from some spheres (e.g., business).\n\nEdgarGBasm: &gt; \"you must not commit a crime, or you will be punished\"\n\nThis is a misread of the logic; it should be \"you must not commit a crime, or you *could* be punished\". The logic works as long as the subject is aware of the power wielder's reserved power, whether or not that power necessarily would be brought to bear. It works without explicit threat, since threat is implicit in the possibility that power *could* be exercised. FWIW, I would not have used governance as an example myself exactly because it draws out this intuition about explicit threats, which is not what I aimed at.\n\nThe more relevant sexual analogy might be a woman with a guy who could easily physically overpower her. Even without threatening to overpower her (he could be the sweetest guy in the world), the fact that he *could* overpower her exerts power over her (the fact that he could overpower her is essentially the same as saying that at *some* possible world, he *does* overpower her). Aware of this possibility and not sure which possible world she is in yet, the fact that she might be in the possible world where he does overpower her will influence her decisions, which is (one way of) exerting power. Since his ability to overpower her is a property belonging to him, he is exerting power over her without making any explicit threat to that end or even considering exerting that power.\n\n&gt; ..yet I think some extreme-minded folks...\n\nI'm not sure how to think that all heterosexual sex is rape *and* it is possible to form consensual heterosexual sexual agreements. As to other consensual agreements, I don't think we generally consider such agreements as strongly requiring consent in the way that sex-not-being-rape does. I might be wrong on this; we might just not be as explicit about considering consent in such arrangements.\nslickwombat: &gt;FWIW, I would not have used governance as an example myself exactly because it draws out this intuition about explicit threats, which is not what I aimed at.\n\nFair enough...\n\n&gt;The more relevant sexual analogy might be a woman with a guy who could easily physically overpower her. Even without threatening to overpower her (he could be the sweetest guy in the world), the fact that he could overpower her exerts power over her\n\nOkay, but you're talking a *fact about a guy* exerting power, by which you mean, being a factor in one's decision-making or attitudes regarding said guy. If that can be meaningfully said to be an exertion of power at all -- which I find highly dubious -- it certainly isn't an exertion *by him*.\n\n&gt;(the fact that he could overpower her is essentially the same as saying that at some possible world, he does overpower her)\n\nSure, but only in the trivial sense that in some possible world each of us is a serial killer.\n\n&gt;I'm not sure how to think that all heterosexual sex is rape and it is possible to form consensual heterosexual sexual agreements. \n\nI'd agree it isn't, unless \"rape\" is redefined to the point where it no longer ought to imply any condemnation.\n\n&gt;As to other consensual agreements, I don't think we generally consider such agreements as strongly requiring consent in the way that sex-not-being-rape does.\n\nPerhaps not, but then the question is why and under what conditions some forms of consensual activity are subject to these putative power dynamics, and others aren't. \nEdgarGBasm: The fact that a guy *could* exert power is a property of that guy. If a guy has that property, then he is thing that is exerting that power; it's some property of his that is the coercive force. It might not be his intent to do so, in the same way it's not my intent for my body odor to make people leave a room, but he is the thing doing it.\n\n&gt; why and under what conditions some forms of consensual activity \n\nI was expressing some mild skepticism (honestly not sure what I think here) that these are in fact consensual activities or activities for which consent is required.\n\n\n\n\nslickwombat: &gt;The fact that a guy could exert power is a property of that guy. If a guy has that property, then he is thing that is exerting that power; it's some property of his that is the coercive force.\n\nYou're trying to gloss over the distinctions by rewording, but being able to do something is not the same as exerting the power to do something, or exerting a power upon someone to believe that you can do it. An exertion is *doing something*.\n\n\nEdgarGBasm: A property of an object causing some reaction by another object. The magnet *caused* the iron filings to move; even though it might be only in virtue of a property of the magnet, we still say the magnet caused the event. Likewise, if a guy has a property, like physical strength, and property causes a reaction in some other person, it's at least not particularly controversial to say the *guy* caused the reaction, even if it was only in virtue of some property attributable to him. If power (as discussed in the other post) has to do with the ability to get someone else to do what you want them to, then successfully influencing them towards doing what you want them to counts as exercising power. If some property of a guy influences someone else toward doing what he wants them to, then he has exerted power over them.\n\nThis phenomenon more generally is what's being described by the modal logic in the other post--eg that being able to exert power A is equivalent to actually exerting another power B, or \u22c4P'(ABC) -&gt; P'(ABD) (read loosely as \"If A *could* exert power over B to end C, then A *actually* exerts power over B to end D).\nslickwombat: I appreciate (what I assume to be devil's advocate) effort here, but there simply is no reasonable, intuitive, or relevant sense of \"exertion of power by you\" that might extend to \"someone forming a belief about you, or reacting to you, based on something about you.\"\n\nAlternatively: let's just stipulate that there is such a thing as unintentional and passive exertion of power. Going back to the context for this particular discussion:\n\n&gt;&gt;Surely something as condemnable as rape requires not merely having power, but also exercising it in some intentional and illicit way.\n\n&gt;That's why I linked to that other post, which I think (with modest success) suggests how having power could entail exercising power.\n\nTo propose that there is such a thing as passive, unintentional exercise of power doesn't respond to my point, which is that rape being a condemnable action requires *intentional and illicit* exercise of power. \n\n\nEdgarGBasm: &gt; rape being a condemnable action requires intentional and illicit exercise of power.\n\nThis may be the case, but this would suggest that rape is *something more* than non-consensual sexual activity. Which would mean that not all instances of non-consensual sexual activity are necessarily rape. This might be fine, but I think it'd be better if we could say there are instances of *fully* consensual sexual activity, or at least highly consensual if we're willing to take consent as a graded phenomenon.\n\n&gt; ...simply is no reasonable, intuitive, or relevant sense of \"exertion of power by you\" that might extend to \"someone forming a belief about you, or reacting to you, based on something about you.\"\n\nIt might not be simple or intuitive, but that is what the other post is suggesting. While I haven't given this total credence yet, I'm not exactly fully playing the devil, since I think it's at minimum *plausible* that power is exerted this way (it might be clearer to say something like 'actualized' or 'realized' rather than 'exerted', since it doesn't draw out intuitions about intent). I definitely do feel a little on the back foot against your complaints, but I don't think it's a KO yet.\nslickwombat: &gt; This may be the case, but this would suggest that rape is something more than non-consensual sexual activity. Which would mean that not all instances of non-consensual sexual activity are necessarily rape.\n\nI would take non-consent to be necessary but not sufficient. There must also be an element of assault or coercion involved. Some examples of non-consensual sex that aren't rape:\n\n- Two people taken to be incapable of consent (e.g., if they are profoundly mentally handicapped) having sex.\n- A kidnapper forcing two people to have sex with one another. (Neither is raping the other, and the kidnapper is not raping them.)\n\nIn any case, it's hard for me to see how one might retain the basic idea of rape as a heinous and condemnable act while also suggesting there might be such a thing as \"unintentional and/or permissible rape\" (i.e., not intentional and illicit).\n\nAnyway, that's quite enough rape talk from me for one evening. :) Thanks for the provocative topic, apologies that it wasn't better-received...\nEdgarGBasm: Eh.

If not, what makes this scenario different?\n[deleted]: Depends on your definition of 'ethics'. I argue that it wouldn't be unethical to kill 'isolately'. To kill any living being is 'fine' as long as their death does not inflict suffering on other living beings. For example, to kill a calf would be 'wrong' because their mother would suffer by cause of their death.\n\nHowever, if said calf existed in isolation and their death did not cause emotional or physical harm on others \u2013 and the procedure was to be done painlessly \u2013 I can see no problem with their murder.

After a while that *inference* became something that made them able to survive better than other animals.  So is that what you're arguing that the ability to make inference and reason was a useful trait in survival of our species therefore could have arisen form nature?  \nWhiteEyeHannya: It can be even simpler than that. Pattern recognition in general is sufficient for rudimentary reason. Inference in many cases is statistical like you said. Our system has the strange combination of being communicable and also self referencing. The thing I wanted most to get across is that no matter how complex the system it is still physical, and as such is part of this deterministic universe.\nohmanchild: I'm sorry.  What system of complexity are you speaking of is physical?  Are you saying there is nothing the universe that is not a system?  If something is not a system can we then agree that it is not physical?   \nWhiteEyeHannya: Kinda. I really like the Ontic Structural Realism approach. The structure is what is primary. I would say that there isn't anything that is not physical (I may place more under this term than you feel is appropriate). To be aphysical would be to not exist. I often hear mathematics as a retort to this, but abstractions from real relations (math) however constructed exists as a brain state in relation to the existing world. There is no Platonic realm in my view.\nohmanchild: I'd have to disagree that mathematics have been and are limited to real relations, mathematics doesn't work in a quantum world.   Things become so fast, incalculable, that by the time light returns to the observer there is only a cloud of probability.  There values become abstract and not physical at all.  \nWhiteEyeHannya: What the hell are you talking about?\n\nYou should read up on how QFT actually works. If you go into it with classical presuppositions you are going to have a bad time. Wave mechanics is no less deterministic than particle mechanics. You just use different math for different applications. The probability function is one aspect of one operation in QM. Also incalculability does not prove or disprove the physicality of an event. Some equations are unsolvable because we don't quite understand the system. Others are unsolvable because they literally have no analytic solution. So we invent things like perturbation theory to solve them. The values become unintuitive, not nonphysical. Its called quantum PHYSICS for a reason, not magic.

You can say physical is intuitive, but don't expect me to role over because you get upset and claim authority on the matter.  The very thing that is *not known* means *not physical* and just because you say *yet* doesn't cancel out the fact.  Your *yet* is HIGHLY arrogant in any sense of the word because *what is* is begging the question *what is not*.  I don't care about your feelings about it or your hot blood.  I'm not saying a theory is odd and it doesn't take a genius to understand electron clouds.  Nor did I say it is magic, I said it's not physical.  Not physical doesn't mean magic it means it's not physical.  Also make sure you tell this to every Ontologist with a PhD that you cracked the case on the matter.  \nWhiteEyeHannya: Here are your exact claims I took issue with:\n\n&gt;mathematics doesn't work in a quantum world\n\nFalse.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: Twitter\u2019s Lawsuit Against Elon Musk to Get First Hearing on July 19\n[deleted]\nJim63t: Hope this ends with Elon still buying Twitter but at a much  better price. I was actually excited to see him clean house at Twitter and get rid of the censorship.\nBanner80: The expected outcome of this lawsuit is that Musk will eventually settle out of court paying maybe $5 billion to Twitter to make this go away.\n\nI don't know how you missed it, but Musk has been a douchebag about this process throughout, as usual, and he has no leg to stand on legally either. He is at fault and will have to make some sort of offer to get out of this. \n\nAnd that is assuming he didn't sell his Twitter stock at a profit already, which would open the door for manipulation charges. Normally I wouldn't expect anyone to be that stupid, but we are talking about Musk here, he has a habit of thinking the SEC are a joke and testing the theory.\nJim63t: The penalty is 1b in the contract. How do you get to 5b?   4d in slander? Don't see anything really. \n\nBeing a douchebag isn't illegal. Maybe it goes back to not disparaging Twitter in the contract, but like I said I don't see a poop emoji costing Elon that much. \n\nAnd is Twitter really didn't provide the data that Elon requested than I but he walks away free and clear. Now a more interesting discussion is why Twitter is (or may be) hiding the bot count.\nBanner80: &gt;The penalty is 1b in the contract. \n\nThat's the exit fee if there's a material reason why the purchase can't continue. This is why Musk is making a whole display about bots, he is trying to argue that there's a reason why the deal can't continue, so he only has to pay the 1 billion fee.\n\nBut the deal was: 1 billion if there's a material reason stopping the deal (like the SEC intervening or outright fraud), or he has to buy Twitter for the agreed price. Those are the only 2 options. Also, when he signed that deal he agreed that Twitter comes as-is, bots and all and there was no need for a discovery process. So there is no conversation to be had about bots or anything else, Musk had already agreed to buy as-is.\n\nSo to sum up: he agreed to those 2 options, and there's nothing stopping the deal. The bot thing is made up and has no effect on the contract. So Musk has no option but to buy Twitter at the agreed price. But he is going to try to sue to make up a whole thing about bots and whatever other BS he can think of to try to pretend there's a material reason why he can't close the deal. He is going to have his lawyers try to claim fraud.\n\nThis will likely drag for a while, and eventually Musk will offer Twitter enough money to cover the legal expenses and be ok with just letting the whole thing go. Because Musk simply doesn't want to buy Twitter at this stage (probably doesn't have the money, or never wanted to, we don't know the exact reason since he'd just lie).\n\nTwitter on their end can most likely keep pushing this legal battle and win eventually, but it will take years of BS and dragging from Musk, and the outcome would be to have to sell to Musk which is also undesirable. So when Musk makes an offer for a few billion to let it go, Twitter will likely accept to take the profit and be done with this noise, but it's going to have to be for enough to make up for all the BS, they are not going to let it go at 1 billion.\nJim63t: So this contract is far from as-is or a done deal. Looking at section 4.6. Bots go to the very core of Twitter's value.

If you wanted to be a part time caretaker you could volunteer at a shelter. \n\n\nEdit: this isn't about cats, this is about cat owners. \nILoveLampz: This sounds like an extremely sheltered mentality.

This is where the responsibility part comes in.\n\n\n&gt; Dogs can bite/kill you, cats can't. Your comparing apples to oranges.\n\nYes, and we're not comparing how dangerous these animals are. We are discussing the level of responsibility the owner has over the pets actions. \n\n\nI guess its okay for small dogs to roam freely since they can't kill you?\nILoveLampz: I don't think we'll get anywhere with this argument.

I grew up in a neighborhood where everyone let their cats roam free, and never heard a negative thing about it. We probably have opposite experiences and yours help you justify your argument the same as my own.\n[deleted]: Nope, our experiences are similar. You probably don't hear about it often because it is to some degree a pointless argument. Cat owners don't really care.  So what can people really do about it? They just accept it.\n\n\nI just think its hilarious that some how people think that responsibility for their pet stops at their door. Sort of a out of sight out of mind situation. On top of that they wouldn't allow it for anything else. Its hard to believe someone can think their pet crapping in a childrens play pen that isn't even your own is okay. \ngreg19735: They wouldn't allow it for anything else because the other situations are ridiculous. Cats, dogs and other pets are all different.\n\nAnd really who cares? People can be great owners for their cat and let them roam around outside. I've never owned a cat and never had an issue with other people's cat.\n[deleted]: So its okay for someone elses pet to crap in this kids sand box? \n\nWe're not talking about the differences between kinds of pets. We are talking about responsibility for a pets actions, regardless of what kind of pet it is. \ngreg19735: no, it's not. but that's basically one of the few things that might happen.\n\nAlso, there's plenty of other wild animals. A responsible owner covers the sand box regardless.

{"full_text": "datingnoob-plshelp: Feeling like I can\u2019t talk to or rely on anyone when I feel like crap. Anyone feel like that?\nI feel like I have a hard time connecting to people. Past few years I\u2019ve had times where I was having hard time coping with different things and relationships and I feel like there is NO one I can turn to (hence I\u2019m turning to strangers on Reddit). I feel like I can\u2019t reveal how I actually feel because 1) no one has the time to listen to me rant, 2) I sound pathetic and lame, 3) people honestly don\u2019t care much about me. Unfortunately for me, I\u2019m the type that have a hard time dealing with things internally. My thoughts go in circles, I over analyze, I ruminate and obsess. Only way out is to talk to people. Because of how I feel, I feel like I have no real friends. And that lead me to think wtf is wrong with me??\n\nI\u2019ve tried therapy. Can\u2019t find a good one. Just a waste of time and money telling my stories over and over again to no avail.\n\nAnyone else feel like this (so I don\u2019t feel so weird and alone)? How do you cope or get out of this rut?\nAlytia: I completely sympathize and I think I can help solve your problem. I was the same way - obsessing about things and going around and around in circles in my head until I thought I was going to go insane. I used to dump it all on friends... which made me lose them. It's bloody hard work being someone's emotional crutch and I don't blame them in the least for not being able to handle it. \n\nThe way I broke the cycle in my head was to write it all down in a journal. This has multiple benefits:\n\n1). By dumping my problems on paper instead of using my friends up, I relieved the burden I was placing on other people.\n\n2). I found it easier to identify the circles I was making in my head. I'd scan back up the page and be like, okay, I'd already made that point earlier and I have nothing new to add to it - I need to move onto something new that's bothering me.\n\n3). I could come back to what I'd written the next day with a fresh set of eyes. Often I'd find that whatever was bothering me was... like you say, lame and pathetic. I'd be really grateful that I didn't tell someone else what I'd been thinking. Or if it wasn't, I could better identify solutions or strategies for my problem. I didn't need a friend to tell me what to do, I just needed some space to think about it.\n\n4). Over time you can track trends in the way that you've been thinking. I look back at my earliest entries and am amazed at how far I've come. It's actually pretty great.\n\nThe way I do it is set aside some time every day for journaling. If pesky thoughts arise during the day, I say 'okay I hear you, but now's not the time for this - save it for later.' Sometimes I sit down to write and find that I can't even remember what was bothering me so much in the first place.\n\nHope this helps you just as much as it's helped me.\ndatingnoob-plshelp: Thank you. I have tried journaling (still am). In fact I journal in 3 different places depending where I am. I also jog down nagging thoughts throughout the day (I can\u2019t push things out of my mind), but doesn\u2019t seems to help. I feel like I need a sounding board to bounce off information and to discuss with. But maybe i need to repeatedly go back to what I put down. \nAlytia: You're welcome! It's great that you're trying things - lots of people complain about their situation but refuse to do anything about it. Perhaps you just need to change your approach a little? Here's something which helps me: I'm okay with pouring all of my angst and misery onto the page, but I also always try and end each entry with a solution.\n\nThen I usually start the next entry with a review of how the previous day went. Did my solution work? Or do I need to try a different approach? Or maybe I forgot to try it, so I'll have to do it again tomorrow. I try and be kind to myself about this - I use humour if I'm being reproachful.\n\nI also tend to talk to myself in the second person, which might sound a bit weird. But it helps me feel like I'm taking an outside perspective on what's happening inside my head. I ask myself questions, like *'Why do you react this way?'* or make observations, like *'You always assume that people don't like you. But there could be a million reasons why you might experience perceived dislike or neglect, and most of them have nothing to do with you. Dwelling on howother people feel about you is silly.'*\n\nSecond. It's helpful to be skeptical about just how important your thoughts and anxieties are. I know that mine often seem incredibly big when I'm having them, but once I gain some perspective, they become inconsequential. It becomes easy to sort out what really matters, and then to let the confusing extra bits fly away.\n\nFinally... I think that you've got two separate issues: 1) over-analysing your thoughts, which keep turning in circles in your head, and 2) feeling alone and/or lonely. The problem is, if your solution to 1) is to dump your negative feelings and thoughts on other people to help clear your head, you'll find it very difficult to fix problem 2) because it's very hard to be close friends with someone who cannot contain themselves emotionally.\n\nIf you can go some way to becoming more emotionally independent and to rely on yourself to generate solutions, then you'll be a better friend. Less self-absorbed... more aware of others.\n\nBest of luck!\ndatingnoob-plshelp: I think your approach is really good. Think all I was doing was verbal dump everything out but didn\u2019t really think about how to use that information to help myself. \n\nI talk to myself too! I have two google accts sometimes I talk to myself from a second person perspective and that kinda helps.\n\nI feel like I am mindful to not be self absorbed. But you\u2019re right, if I\u2019m so emotionally preoccupied with my thoughts and feelings there\u2019s no way it doesn\u2019t seep out into my relationship with others.\n\nThanks again!

The table is $700 alone, I do have a friend who has certain tools and is willing to help me however he has only built bedframes and beehives from what I know. He hasn't built a table before but he offered to help regardless. Say if I had a table saw, router, drill press, and cut off saw would it make it easier to make?\nLittleJackass80: Absolutely. So let's say you don't really need to buy tools and you just have to get lumber and fasteners. My first step would be looking at what kind of wood I'd want and how I'm going to assemble the top. The other pieces, the legs, aprons, etc, you could use a wood that isn't as nice, but the top matters. This is especially challenging because you want to stain - which hides much less imperfection than paint, so the wood has to be nice to begin with.\n\nAssemble the top sounds like overkill, but you have to consider you won't find a slab of wood that size for a decent price, so you'll be joining some more narrow pieces together to form the wider top. (There are more tools involved here, however let's not consider them for now, let's just focus on the lumber.) Pine or Fir is going to be the cheapest and most available to you in big box stores. It also looks the cheapest and is soft and will easily pick up markings from writing on the table/pressing too hard. There are also more knots and imperfections in this type of wood. If you were going for a rustic or industrial look, I'd say go for it, but this is more finished looking to me.\n\nThis leaves us looking at nicer woods or high grade plywood with edge banding. You can find both of these options at big box stores, however the quality simply isn't what you'd find at a yard or specialty store. (Think lots of warping, wood that's been there for who knows how long, and a lack of knowledge from underpaid and under trained associates.) \n\nThe hardware, stain, sealer, and fasteners wouldn't be a terrible cost, probably around $50, but the lumber is going to sting. Figure out your plan - (btw, look on sites like Ana White for free plans that tells you how much of everything you need,) and take that list to the store and see what the cost is. Plan for waste, up your needed lumber, and see if you feel it's worth it. \n\n(Another option would be to find a table top on another old table and refinish it and just make the base.

The shorter the distance between the hinge and the string's contact point (up to a certain point; too close and it'll require too much torque) the faster your wings will pop up. \n\nKeeping them in place afterwards, however, is a little trickier. Again, off the top of my head, you could use some sort of clips with light springs to \"lock\" the wings in place; depressing them to get the wings back down would either necessitate another string, or for an adult to push them down so the ribs can bypass the clips. I realize this is a little abstract, so I'll upload a picture in a second of what I'm talking about. \nwrdsrindescribable: Thank you so much! A picture would be great!\nGorilla_My_Dreams: http://i.imgur.com/rowYU4m.jpg\n\nHopefully this makes things a little clearer, but the basic idea is you'll need a bracket to attach the wings to the pack; you'll want something that will allow a peg to swivel inside a groove of some kind. This is your point of contact between the rib and the backpack. \n\nThen you'll need a peg for the rubber band to hook onto; one on each wing, and one on the pack where I labeled it. You could just use one rubber band for this, and it should keep things simple. \n\nThe last thing you'll need (I didn't draw it in the picture because it would have been too messy) is a set of stopping blocks to keep the wings in place; for each wing, you'll want a block to hold the wing in place while it's down (this will resist the rubber band until you push the wing out so that it's no longer stopping the rib from rotating) and another to stop the wing at the ideal position (the rib will hit this and keep the wing in place). \n\nTo \"activate\" the wings, you'll just push the wings out a little to get them free of the first stopping block. It's not the most elegant design, but it will work and more importantly it's pretty simple. If you end up doing it this way, I'm sure you'll come up with improvements while you're building it. I hope this made sense. If you need any more help, feel free to ask. I hope your kid's halloween is awesome. \nwrdsrindescribable: One question. What is the bracket? And how does it work?\n\nThanks again!\nGorilla_My_Dreams: The bracket is something you'll have to find/make. It'll be a flat plate that can be attached firmly to the backpack. The top of the bracket should have a notch in it that can hold the hinge from the wing. This is basically the shoulder joint for the wings. You'll need one for each of the wings. Make sense?\nwrdsrindescribable: Ohh ok! I was thinking it was just one bracket for both wings! Makes more sense now! Thanks!\n\nIn the picture, do you have 2 rubber bands? Or is the one attached to the wing something else?\n\n~~I'll try to post a picture of what I'm thinking~~\n\nedit: I can't draw this! Sorry \nGorilla_My_Dreams: Sure thing. \n\nThe picture shows two rubber bands. You could do that, or just use one, which would ostensibly increase your tensile strength, and therefore make the wings pop up faster, which is obviously cooler. But since you're working with cardboard, there's a limit to what it will withstand. \nwrdsrindescribable: Sounds great!\n\nLast question (I hope), how do I attach the string?

Previously I couldn\u2019t taste or smell anything at all.\nYttriel: Gotcha. Well just know that you're not alone and once you regain your smell to avoid zinc!\nPetrichordates: Zinc is good for both getting over colds and maintaining healthy testosterone levels, some people are probably modestly deficient so a blanket prescription of \"avoid zinc\" isn't great advice.\nYttriel: A good general rule of thumb is to avoid most things if they can otherwise be gotten through your diet. If you're worried about testosterone levels, eat more foods with zinc but I still say avoid vitamins/medicines with added zinc.\n\nI'm sorry but, \"reducing a cold by one day if taken within the first 24 hours of a cold,\" does not outweigh the potential permanent loss of smell.\nPetrichordates: I'm not aware of evidence that this risk is as significant as you imply.\nYttriel: You know how an old study found that vaccines cause autism? More recent studies have since debunked this, but the world at large still draws a connection between vaccines and autism.\n\nAn old study found that Vitamin C helped tremendously with colds. More recent studies have found that this isn't really the case, at best some people can lessen their cold by maybe a day. But the world at large thinks Vitamin C will cure their cold.\n\nA 1984 study found Zinc to be wonderful for colds. Now more recent studies have found this to be inconsistent, at best you can lessen a cold by a day if you take zinc promptly. But many newer studies find inconsistencies with Zinc's usefulness. But people still view it as a godsend. \n\nZinc-containing nasal sprays, namely Zicam were taken off the market in 2009 because they were causing permanent loss of smell in some people. People reported that one day their nose suddenly burned from it after never having burned before. Some people lost their sense of smell/taste permanently, some gained some of their smell back after months...\n\nTaking supplemental Zinc is just not worth the risk. Just eat a few oysters or something.\nPetrichordates: Oh nasal sprays, you didn't mention that part. That obviously changes everything.\n\nThe point that zinc is the only proven vitamin/mineral that helps you get better faster is pretty damn significant.\nYttriel: Probiotics (again I advocate for sourcing from diet rather than supplements) have and always will be the ultimate helper to one's resistance to colds.\n\nTake zinc if you want, just know there are side effects. If you really want to boost your immune system look into probiotic foods - which have never made anyone lose their sense of smell.\nPetrichordates: Do you have scientific evidence to back up that statement? Probiotics reduce the length of illness? Which?\n\nWhat are the side effects to zinc? You started off with some anosmia thing but neglected to mention you were only referencing nasal sprays. I feel like you keep continuing with that conflation too, as high zinc foods or supplements aren't destroying anyone's noses.\nYttriel: Evidence to which of my statements?\n\nI understand that the actual scientific research does not mention anosmia as an effect of zinc in a tablet, so if that is the only thing you're willing to go off of then there's no point in continuing.\n\nMy reason to believe that zinc even in tablet form not just in a nasal spray can cause anosmia is based on personal experience. I wasn't sick, I had no sinus issues going on at the time when I took two (the recommended amount for my age) multivitamins which advertised \"plus zinc,\" and I then lost 90% (that number is just me, it's not an exact or doctor-appointed number) of my sense of smell.\n\nSo, yeah, perhaps the scientific research doesn't back it, but I absolutely believe that if a proper study was done that they would find results which support my claims. I've also known someone else to lose most of their sense of smell and it happened after they started taking multivitamins with zinc. IIRC the rich of the ancient Greeks took Mercury for health reasons, and now we know how toxic Mercury is.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those anti-big-pharma or anti-modern-medicine people, I love advancements in medicine, I'm just of the belief that we don't understand the dangers of zinc yet, because me and someone else I know have had an adverse side effect. Could it have been something else? Yes. Can I live my life without supplemental zinc and avoid the potential risk without decreasing my quality of life? Absolutely and I recommend others to do the same. Especially those who already have lost some sense of smell. I'm afraid that if I started taking supplemental Zinc again I could lose 100%.\nPetrichordates: You're spreading misinformation my man. I asked for simple evidence of your assertions and you won't provide them, while attacking scientific evidence for zinc as inadequate  while conflating nasal sprays with zinc in general. You're even using a personal anecdote to make a scientific claim (seriously??), which is exactly the same as what the anti-vaccine folk do.\n\nI will continue to reply as long as you spread misinformation, in case anyone is misled by that nonsense.\n\nDo you think they just didn't study it and you discovered something all by yourself that studies will eventually back up?

It might go through a lot of layers and it obviously does, BUT it will still follow the rules, or else magic exists. In the sense that magic is unexplainable and doesn't follow rules etc.\n\nSo I guess my point is that if free will actually existed, it would be magic since it doesn't make sense.\nlapse_of_taste: You should read the thread I posted in response to another reply. You can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/26wgbe/has_equal_chance_technology_created_by_us_ruined/chvvwrv). It explains how free will is possible even though we follow physical laws.\nsoonandsoforthsir: I read it and I stand by what I say.\n\nIt is silly for me to honestly discuss free will if I honestly don't think it exists.\n\nWhat I meant earlier with the brain chemistry thing is; if all the different particles/molecules whizzing around in your brain is what make up thoughts, and those particles/molecules follow the same rules in your brain as the same type of particles would outside of your brain whence cometh free will?\n\nApparently I'm really having a hard time explaining what I mean, so I'll try with another thing:\n\nThe big bang happened, all the stuff that was there, from it's inception, followed the rules of the universe. Sub-atomic particle A from over here ends over there 10 minutes later because of gravity, electromagnetic force etc etc. Now, all this stuff happens for a lot of years, and planets start to form because af gravity and all that. Some stuff gets stirred up in some water and life gets created or whatever. That life evolves following those very same rules (I doubt if you would claim that a plant has free will, so how far up the animal chain does free will begin?), a human is born and it is the same story.\nThe human just follows all the rules on a microscopic level and otherwise.\n\nMy point being that life is just like a machine who's component parts accidentally fell into place so that it could/would use energy to move around and procreate and such.\n\nHence: free will doesn't exist.\n\nbtw really liking this discussion! I've had my thoughts on free will for a long time, but this discussion has forced me to try to reason my thoughts out even more, which is nice :)\nyourlycantbsrs: It's shameful how much you've thought on your own about this and how little you've read about this.\nsoonandsoforthsir: You're calling me stupid, right?\nyourlycantbsrs: No, I'm calling you unreliable. When forming a belief on a complicated subject, thinking on your own is not the best method.\nsoonandsoforthsir: So where am I going wrong, if you chose to be constructive and were to help me along?\nyourlycantbsrs: I've already said where you're going wrong, in your process for coming up with your belief.\n\nI'd remedy this situation by taking a look at some SEP entries on free will, compatibilism, and determinism. Maybe post in askphilosophy and ask for other sources.\nsoonandsoforthsir: It seems to me you aren't quite coming out and saying what you actually mean. Have I said something that was wrong? Tell me what it is. Do you think I'm an idiot? Tell me why.\n\nIs it because I don't use academic lingo but what I'm saying makes sense? Then you are just being a snob.\nyourlycantbsrs: &gt;It seems to me you aren't quite coming out and saying what you actually mean. \n\nI actually mean that it's clear that you haven't read much if anything on these topics and that this method is unreliable when it comes to having justified views on complicated issues. I am being very clear in saying this.\n\n&gt;Have I said something that was wrong? Tell me what it is.\n\nListen, pal, other people can't do all the mental legwork that is necessary for you to have justified views. You need to realize that ultimately nobody is responsible for you having justified views except yourself. You need to realize that *you're on the internet* and you are *capable of doing research*. I really hope this doesn't sound harsh. If someone went into r/physics and posted a personal idea that they had after reading a wiki page on QM then thinking long and hard about it, they'd probably get told \"hey, there are better resources where you can learn about this stuff, use them before you come to conclusions\". And that would be exactly the right response.\n\nYou need to understand that philosophy and *pretty much every other discipline* is like this. Nobody thinks by themselves in a vacuum and come up with strong views unless they're some kind of prodigy hypergenius.\n\n&gt;Do you think I'm an idiot? Tell me why.\n\nNo, I just think that you're here for the wrong reasons. I think that lots of people look into philosophy and think about philosophy because they want to feel deep and smart. But that's not the goal of philosophy so if those are your goals, you're going to be doing some bad philosophy. In fact, your initial post was ripe for /r/badphilosophy... \n\n&gt;Is it because I don't use academic lingo but what I'm saying makes sense? Then you are just being a snob.\n\nUh, academic lingo is important when discussing academic topics. It clears up confusions and avoids drawn out explanations of terms. It's not being a snob, it's just expecting that interlocutors would be willing to take the time to familiarize themselves with such helpful terms before entering the conversation. \nsoonandsoforthsir: So I was skimming through the free will entry on wikipedia, and there are apparently also groups of academics that don't believe compatibility is a possibility which I guess means they don't believe free will exists.\n\nI'm saying free will doesn't exist. I'm doing it in layman terms, but I believe I have sound reasoning, so why shouldn't I be allowed to comment if I want too?\nyourlycantbsrs: Why are you skimming wikipedia for philosophy? I already pointed you towards resources. Start here: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/ and here: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/\n\n&gt;there are apparently also groups of academics that don't believe compatibility is a possibility which I guess means they don't believe free will exists.\n\nAnd....? I never said it's not a justifiable position. I just said you've clearly done a poor job of justifying it in your case.\n\n&gt;I'm saying free will doesn't exist. I'm doing it in layman terms, but I believe I have sound reasoning, so why shouldn't I be allowed to comment if I want too?\n\nEarlier in the thread you said this:\n\n&gt;btw really liking this discussion! I've had my thoughts on free will for a long time, but this discussion has forced me to try to reason my thoughts out even more, which is nice :)\n\nThis attitude is very, very irksome for me. I'm thoroughly confused at how anyone who *actually wants to know about the topics* would decide that having conversations with random people on the internet is a good method. \n\nAsk yourself this: what's your primary goal here? Is it actually knowing about the topic? Then read more and write/discuss less. Is it feeling deep and smart and having awesome internet discussions that give you those warm fuzzy intellectual feels? Then keep spouting naive determinism and be thankful that your thoughts aren't being graded. Your ideas would get bad grades because they're *lazy*. You haven't looked into the topic much at all before talking about it a lot.\nsoonandsoforthsir: This is so funny the last part. I read The New Rhetoric a long time ago and that is also one of the things I took with me from that book.\n\nOne of my points was, what I think is a very olskool philosophical tradition, that through reasoning one can get to interesting conclusions.\n\nI know about compatibilism and like I said I think it's bullshit.\n\nI'll admit to being lazy when writing my idea down, but it is quite simple: that every step from subatomic particles to molecules to life, human beings and their psyches are consequences of physical laws, and thusly not free. Hence me writing that free will doesn't exist.\n\nI think the reason why I choose to answer is because it annoys me that free will continues to pop up in this thread, because I think people who actually think free will exists are arrogant, and speciesist. Typical thinking that people are better than animals and plants and what not, and I think it's ridiculous.\n\nNow the fact that you are trying to close my opinion down because it isn't based on something a philosopher has said, well that just shows that you are also arrogant in that sense.\nlapse_of_taste: &gt; that every step from subatomic particles to molecules to life, human beings and their psyches are consequences of physical laws, and thusly not free. Hence me writing that free will doesn't exist.\n\nI want to restate something that was also mentioned in the thread I linked to: When we say something like \"the prisoner is now free\" or \"the slave achieved freedom\", we take *free* to mean something specific. We don't mean that the former prisoner is now free to jump up and fly or the slave is now free to drink up the sea. \n\nLikewise, when we say that someone committed a murder out of free will, we mean that the murderer was not brainwashed, drugged or forced to kill by someone holding a gun at her head. We thus declare the murderers actions blameworthy and say that she was morally responsible. Under your view of free will, we cannot assign moral blame or praise to anybody. There is no moral responsibility without free will.\n\n&gt; I think the reason why I choose to answer is because it annoys me that free will continues to pop up in this thread, because I think people who actually think free will exists are arrogant, and speciesist.\n\nNow, arguing that animals don't have moral status because they don't have free will isn't exactly popular in philosophy, so if that is your only reason to argue against free will, it's not a very good reason. But the bigger problem is that if there is no free will, we cannot blame humans for being cruel to animals, so if you are right, your reason to argue against free will is moot in the first place.\nsoonandsoforthsir: I am not talking about ethics, animal rights and so on. I am talking about the physical reality we are a part of.\n\nI understand from the link yourlycantbsrs has sent me that people pretty much only discuss this in regard to those subjects, but I am talking about actually being able to make choices in the first place.\n\nI believe that every action has a specific reaction based on physical laws. we might not understand all of them, but none the less.\nI believe that lifeforms from their genesis (badum tsss!) behaved non-randomly and like I said earlier even if the lifeforms become more complex, they still follow very strict rules from cell-mutations up to psychological 'choices'. In other words, that lifeforms are like automatons.\nlapse_of_taste: But the reason why the existence of free will is so relevant is because it is a necessary condition for moral responsibility. The fact that given the same physical laws and starting conditions, we would't have chosen differently doesn't mean that we did not deliberate and act on reasons. It is not at all clear why we need to be unmoved movers in order to have free will.\n\n&gt; In other words, that lifeforms are like automatons.\n\nThat seems completely trivial and not like a very interesting conclusion. It is trivial if \"automatons\" are all beings which act according to laws and don't violate the laws of physics, because unless you believe that there is some prime mover, pretty much every being in this universe is an automaton.\nsoonandsoforthsir: I don't believe there is a prime mover, and I also never said it was an interesting conclusion, but I do not think it is trivial at all, because my point is exactly that everything in existence is like a chain-reaction, even thoughts if they are bound in the physical world.\nIt isn't very flattering to us, but I think that that is the case, and I still haven't really heard a good argument for why that is not the case.\nlapse_of_taste: &gt; my point is exactly that everything in existence is like a chain-reaction, even thoughts if they are bound in the physical world.\n\nCompatibilists don't deny this. They don't need to argue against this in order to show how free will is possible.\nsoonandsoforthsir: Yeah, I read that. I guess I just understand the word/phrase weirdly then.

The person above probably thought you were referring to passive stretching (ex: touching your toes and holding for a few seconds).  Active stretching should proceed all workouts if you intend on keeping it safe.  Active stretching includes jumping jacks, lunges without weight, straight leg marches, skips, etc.  It should not be strenuous or difficult, but it should get your heart rate going, get blood flowing through your muscles, and increase body temperature.\n\nAnother good way to remove muscle soreness is through something called myofascial release.  It is essentially a massage of your muscles; you can do it by using a foam roll or a PVC Pipe and rolling it down your muscles.  What it does is separate the muscle fibers in your muscles back to their normal differences.  After a workout, the fascia (outer coating) of the fibers can mesh together, inhibiting sliding filaments, which helps cause soreness.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam_rolling\n\nAnd finally, you can do a lactic acid drain.  After a good lower body workout or run, lay on the grown with your legs straight.  Put your feet about 4-6 inches above the ground (ex. Pushing against the wall) and lay there for 5-ish minutes.  Drains the lactic acid from your muscles, feels real good.  \n\nIf you still feel very sore after all workouts and all of these techniques, lower the volume of your workout for a week or two (download).  Do the same workouts with the same intensity, but do half of the sets/reps.\n\nGood luck\nalexispres: I thought the lactic acid build up was disproven?\nbrawnkowsky: I haven't heard this, source?\nalexispres: \"Lactic Acid is commonly thought to induce muscle failure or soreness, but has not been shown to be the causative factor.

But according to examine.com there is no evidence it causes soreness. It still occurs though. :)\nbrawnkowsky: You're right, lactic acid doesn't cause soreness.

While it's true that stretching when sore might seem counterintuitive, the answer lies in understanding the nature of soreness and the benefits of consistent stretching.

I was thinking that if I got a pretty thick foam wedge that expanded then I could stick it in the back of the cabinet with the thickest side towards the back, and then slide the oven in and as the foam expanded it would push down slightly on the oven and prevent it from rocking much. This seems like it might not be secure enough though, so another thought I had was if I drill two small holes in the top of the cabinet (over each of the back corners of the oven where the hanging screws are supposed to go) then I could put a machine screw bolt (a machine screw without a head) in each of these holes and screw it in and then thread some type of special nut on until it meets the top of the cabinet so these bolts would hold it in place.     \n\nhttp://www.frigidaire.com/products/Kitchen/Microwaves/FGMV154CLF.aspx\ndavey_darling: Your electrician friend was right, and the appliance guy was feeding you a line of bs (or he just didn't know what he was talking about)\n\nThat said there likely isn't great danger in operating the unit this way.\n\nIf the cabinet it is mounted in has a top you could consider mounting it as it was intended - hanging from the top of the cabinet.\nYeah_anuses: Yeah, you got swindled. If it mounts like most over the range microwaves I've seen, your best bet is to screw it into the cabinet from the top.\n\nSince it sounds like you won't have much space to work with, you can't install it properly by using the bracket that attaches it to the wall. For best support you'll want to put some sort of spacer underneath it to elevate it to the right height.\n\nI've seen people put it in like this before. Not the most elegant solution but if you're handy enough to create a facade to cover the gap it shouldn't look too bad. The only bad news is you'll have some goofiness in the shelf above the micro, since your power cord and some screws will be there.\nmemento22mori: The bracket wont quite fit properly, if I did use it then it'd end up being too far back in the cabinet by a few inches so it'd look strange.

{"full_text": "TheZombaslaya: CMV: Americans who live abroad should NOT be subject to US taxation\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, the US is one of two countries in the world, (other being Eritrea), which tax based on citizenship instead of residency.  Most countries have a policy where if you live here, you\u2019re a taxpayer.  The US on the other hand says \u201cIf you\u2019re an American, you\u2019re a taxpayer.\u201d  This means that Americans are subject to taxation no matter where they live, not just in the United States.  If you have American citizenship but live in another country, you must file and pay your country\u2019s taxes as well as file and possibly pay American taxes.  On top of this, the US requires those with foreign bank accounts over $10,000 to file an FBAR form to declare it and their assets.  While the US has agreements in place to limit double taxation (generally if you make under around $100,000~), you still must file tax returns, and due to the obvious complication of living abroad, this can often require an accountant, costing hundreds if not thousands of dollars annually.  Not all forms of income are covered by tax agreements, one noticeable exception is capital gains tax.  If you buy and sell a house, the IRS may come after you for tax on the house.  Mutual Funds are a popular investment, particularly for those saving for retirement.  However, if you live abroad, the IRS considers foreign mutual funds \u201cpassive foreign investment companies\u201d and taxes them at a punitive rate, taking any interest and profit you might make.  \n\nhttps://thunfinancial.com/home/american-expat-financial-advice-research-articles/why-americans-should-never-ever-own-shares-in-a-non-us-incorporated-mutual-fund/\n\nIn 2010, the Obama administration passed a law called FATCA, which blackmails foreign banks into investigating their account holders and clients to find Americans and those with American citizenship and report their accounts the the IRS.  While this law was meant to be a way to crack down on domestic tax evasion, it has become a nightmare for American expats and dual citizens.  If banks don\u2019t comply, they are fined 30% of their U.S. investments.  This has lead to many people loosing their accounts and mortgages as many banks do not want the headache of dealing with the IRS.  \n\nIt\u2019s not just Americans abroad who have to navigate this headache, people who are American citizens who may have never lived in America are subject to these laws, so called \u201cAccidental Americans.\u201d  Under the 14th Amendment, the US grants citizenship to anyone born in the country with the exception of diplomats.  While birthright citizenship may be a blessing to those who want to live in America, it is an absolute nightmare for people born in America while their parents were on vacation or temporarily in the country.  Imagine being Italian, and one of your parents is studying a masters or a PHD at an American university.  You happen to be born while they\u2019re studying, and a couple months later move back to Italy.  Even worse, let\u2019s say one of your parents happens to be American, and you\u2019re born in Italy, and never visit America.  You grow up Italian, speak Italian, you might not even learn English.  You\u2019re just as Italian as anyone else, except, you have American citizenship as well.  Maybe you become 30 years old, you have a life, own a house, a car, you work and are saving for retirement and have all the normal financial assets one would have.  One day, you open the mail and have a letter from your bank.  Your bank is asking for your social security number due to some strange new American law, and if you don\u2019t provide it, your accounts will be closed.  You think it\u2019s a mistake, until you do some research, and see that America can tax all your assets, and you should have been filing American taxes and FBARs for years.  Getting \u201ctax compliant\u201d will cost thousands of dollars in accounting fees, as generally there are few US tax accountants in Italy.  And besides, why do you need to comply with a foreign country\u2019s laws regarding your finances when you have absolutely no ties to that country?  You think, can I just cancel my citizenship and avoid this nightmare? Nope, to renounce your citizenship, that will cost $2,300 and require being tax compliant for 5 years.  In addition, depending on your wealth, you may need to pay a 10% \u201cexit\u201d tax on all your assets.  If the U.S. Government suspects you are renouncing due to tax reasons, you can be banned from ever visiting America.  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/7kK5teCY3Qw\n\nIn 2012, Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, who was living in Singapore at the time canceled his US citizenship which would avoid an estimated $700 Million in capital gains taxes.  This move prompted Senator Chuck Schumer to introduce a bill which would require those renouncing their citizenships to prove it is not for tax reasons.  If someone had a net worth of over $2,000,000, they would be banned from returning to America and be subject to a 30% tax on capital gains.  Thankfully the bill died, but it shows how the government does not care about Americans abroad.  \n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/senators-target-facebook-co-founder-for-giving-up-citizenship-seek-to-impose-taxes\n\nLike I mentioned at the beginning, the other country to do this is Eritrea.  Eritrea has come under international fire for harassing Eritreans living abroad for taxes.  This has lead to the UN general assembly passing a resolution condemning Eritrea for doing this, and many Eritrean diplomats have been expelled from various countries over Eritrea\u2019s citizenship based taxation, including Canada.  Canada has condemned Eritrea\u2019s attempts to tax its citizens, but has been silent and downright cooperative in another country\u2019s efforts in taxation, the United States.  Most countries have fallen in line and are ignoring or even assisting the US\u2019s efforts in hunting down expats and taxing them.  Maybe it has to do with the fact Eritrea\u2019s a poor African nation with a spotty human rights record.  \n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8sM_vlbDuAhWIPM0KHekMALcQFjADegQIAxAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Feritrean-diplomat-ordered-out-of-canada-after-tax-on-ex-pats-1.1309691&amp;usg=AOvVaw3XCez9rEgagNIf_CKS4Gz6  \n\nCitizenship based taxation defies common sense.  You should pay taxes where you live, and where your income is sourced from.  You use the infrastructure where you live, and benefit from the government that oversees your jurisdiction.  Expats don\u2019t use US schools, roads or anything else besides maybe renewing their passport.  Why should they have to pay?  Every other country in the world besides the US and Eritrea has a residency based tax system.  If you\u2019re an Italian and you live in the US, you only file and pay US taxes, but if you\u2019re an American living in Italy, you have to file and pay Italian taxes, as well as possibly US taxes.  It\u2019s an extremely unfair system, and the government has gone out of its way to make life even more difficult for Americans abroad.  After FATCA was passed, the US saw many expats were canceling their citizenship.  Instead of reviewing why this was, the US proceeds to raise the fee to do so to over $2,000.  Americans abroad also do not get their own representative, they vote in the state which they last lived in, so in that regard they\u2019re considered a state resident, even while living in a completely different country.  What happened to \u201cno taxation without representation?\u201d  There has been a lot of debate over privilege in America, and discrimination.  In these debates, I have not heard one word about Americans living abroad, who are some of the most discriminated against and overlooked Americans.  Expats want to be left alone, and live their lives like anyone else, and not be burdened with draconian financial and tax requirements to what is basically a foreign government.  This has to change.\nMcKoijion: 1. If you pay taxes in a foreign country, you don't have to pay them in the US too. You get a foreign tax credit. So if you go to a lower tax country, you pay the same as if you lived in the US. If you go to a higher tax country, you won't pay the US anything.\n\n2. The US government provides a bunch of services that make it easier for Americans to live abroad. For example, if there is a crisis in your new country, the closest US embassy will send a helicopter filled with fully armed marines to pick you up. The US also exerts significant power to protect American-owned businesses, patents, assets, etc. from foreign governments/powers.\n\n3. You still retain all the rights of an American citizen if you live abroad, such as voting.\nTheZombaslaya: It\u2019s true you get a credit, however you still have to file taxes and FBARs for your bank accounts, which can get complicated and often require tax specialists to complete.  Not all income is included in that exemption, such as mutual funds and capital gains.  \n\nNothing unique to america, many countries provide those services and will evacuate citizens from dangerous areas if need be.  It wasn\u2019t just America that organized flights to wuhan to pick people up when the coronavirus first started.  It is true America has some of the best consular service in the world, but I can safely say it isn\u2019t a result of extra tax money from expats. \n\nMost countries allow citizens to vote from abroad without requiring them to be taxed.  If loosing voting rights is the price for not having to pay taxes abroad, then I\u2019d be more than happy to pay that price.\nmuyamable: &gt;Most countries allow citizens to vote from abroad without requiring them to be taxed.  If loosing voting rights is the price for not having to pay taxes abroad, then I\u2019d be more than happy to pay that price.\n\nSo, pay it? I mean, the solution is easy -- get citizenship somewhere else and renounce your U.S. citizenship. People aren't without choices here.\nTheZombaslaya: Not always practical for everyone, some people have family in the US they would like to visit or need to take care of for example.  Also life can change, maybe 20 years down the road they\u2019ll get a job offer and move back to the US.  Also you generally need another nationality to renounce your citizenship otherwise you\u2019ll become stateless, and naturalizing is not always an easy task.\nmuyamable: &gt; Not always practical for everyone, some people have family in the US they would like to visit or need to take care of for example. Also life can change, maybe 20 years down the road they\u2019ll get a job offer and move back to the US\n\nExactly. And that's my point. On one hand you're saying expats shouldn't be taxed because they don't benefit from U.S. citizenship, but on the other hand you're saying we can't expect expats to give up their citizenship to avoid taxes because they'd have to give up those benefits they derive from U.S. citizenship. If they truly derived no benefits from U.S. citizenship, it wouldn't be a difficult choice.\neevreen: I think the point is more so that if other countries have the same benefits American expats have from their countries without having to also pay their country's taxes or file taxes with their country, it is both possible and more reasonable for America to follow suit. Your argument doesn't really respond to that other than to say \"don't like it, leave\" which is not a reasonable response. I haven't heard an actual *reason* for why Americans have to do this while other first world countries don't force their expat citizens to pay taxes.\nphenixcitywon: your comment, as well as the ops, relies on a presumption that \"not taxing nonresidents\" is the correct, default option. \n\nthere's no inherent reason why that is the case, and neither you nor the OP have demonstrated why it should be the case. \n\n\"That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence\"\neevreen: There are only three countries in the world which tax expats. USA, Eritrea, and Myanmar. If 200 odd countries decide not to tax expats and 3 do, which would you presume to be the logical norm?\nphenixcitywon: i wouldn't presume anything... because there's no logical norm? \n\nalso, you say \"decide not to\" as if it's identical to \"functionally aren't able to, so don't bother\"\neevreen: If countries as small as Eritrea and Myanmar were functionally able to, I don't see why countries such as the UK, China, Russia, and any other country aren't functionally able to.\nphenixcitywon: eritrea and myanmar have a) no rich people b) no capacity to force rich expats to pay their domestic non-resident citizen tax, so who cares what their book law says about it.\neevreen: If they can't force their expats to pay, then functionally *only* the US makes expats pay taxes based on citizenship, which goes back to the point OP (and I) were making earlier: there is no reason this shouldn't change.\nphenixcitywon: \"we can make you pay, others can't\" isn't a reason for change...\n", "prompt": "TheZombaslaya: CMV: Americans who live abroad should NOT be subject to US taxation\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, the US is one of two countries in the world, (other being Eritrea), which tax based on citizenship instead of residency.

Good for you, if you can afford it. Bad luck to those who can't. \nDietOfTheMind: Because Trump is not as bad as Hitler.  You missed him saying explicitly saying that.  If he was, he would suggest Jews to run, just like his grandfather did.\n\nBasically it's this:  Hitler said he would do something bad to Jews, people pretended he wouldn't.  They were Jews, so they should have left.  Trump has not said anything too bad about Jews, so the advice is not to leave *yet*.  The advice is to protect people who are most persecuted, which is what *everyone else in Austria should've done for the Jews*.\nmichaelnoir: Yes, but not *what his grandfather did*, which makes the title inaccurate. He doesn't seem to have protected the Jews, but to have got himself and his family out of the country. That tells me that his grandfather was lucky enough, and wealthy enough, to escape the country, and the poorer Jews were left behind, to face the gas chambers. The grandfather of all people was the very one who did not support the Jews. The truth is that no-one supported the Jews.\n\nJust say Trump begins to persecute Mexicans (never going to happen, he only seems to have a problem with illegal immigrants). Should the Mexicans stay and fight, and support one another, or should they flee the country, as the grandfather did? What about the ones who can't afford to move to another country? \nFibonacci35813: Fine. Not the best title.  Maybe it should be more abstract : The lessons I learned from my grandfather.  \n\nHowever, the fact that you are judging an entire article based on the title is concerning.  \n\nBesides, Authors don't always get to choose their titles.  I'm not sure if that's the case here but it doesn't matter.  Don't judge an article on its title.\n\n\n\n\nmichaelnoir: I object to the premise of the whole article, which is that Trump is analogous to Hitler. Too many people have made that lazy comparison. I also think it's partly in bad taste to invoke the Holocaust and one's grandparents when you want to lend moral weight to any little point. The whole article is sanctimonious and misleading.\nInterestNews: Literal Holocaust survivors as well as historians have noted the comparisons between Hitler and Trump. This isn't the same as Godwin's law \nmichaelnoir: The comparisons only go so far as a bit of scapegoating of illegal immigrants and Muslims to get himself into power. He's not going to start rounding these people up and putting them into death camps at any point. So it's questionable how useful the analogy is.\nDietOfTheMind: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/11/16/is-the-trump-administration-really-going-to-launch-a-registry-for-muslims/\n\nUntil Trump shoots himself in the head outside of his bombed out bunker in DC, you can say \"I'm not sure how useful the analogy is\".  The problem with what you're saying is that you imply both that it's *impossible* for Trump to do these things, and that there's *no evidence* to suggest he might.  It's not impossible and there is evidence.  Part of what makes it possible is people constantly saying it *is* impossible, and thus that statement alone is all the defence we need.\n\nAgain, just to clarify, I don't think he's going to have death camps either, but we must block the path to death camps at every sign-post we know.  We failed in the election to do that, and if we allow him to consider the possibility of making a Muslim registration, we'll fail at the next post too, and on and on it can go if we let it, if he wants to.\n", "prompt": "JuliettPapaRomeo: What to Do About Trump?

Actual, 1800s-era, manual-labor-on-a-farm slaves usually got food and a roof. That doesn't make them not slaves.\nSendstorepatter: They get paid too. It's just a tiny amount.

Do you think they just let them die off each season and bought new ones the next? Do you think that if an owner didn't make any money all year, that means the people who did all the work still weren't slaves the entire time?

Here's what just happened:\n\nYou: *They get food and housing, so they're not slaves.*\n\nMe: *Slaves do get food and housing.

They're the people you should blame.\nto_tomorrow: It's actually the opposite of that given it's the over-consumption of water by commercial entities like farmers who are gifted extremely cheap &amp; unlimited tax-funded water. If everyone had to pay real market rates for water we wouldn't see some of the most water-intensive crops on Earth in drought-stricken regions. This was the Nestle CEO's point but no one ever bothers to actually read what he said. EDIT: I went way into depth on this in a comment further down this chain for folks who are interested. Please check it out before reacting/down-voting me. ;-)\nLet-s_Do_This: Admittedly I don't understand the situation all that well, but it sounds like you are justifying someones wrong actions by equating it to someone else's wrong actions. \nto_tomorrow: No I actually just read his quote in context and am describing exactly what his argument is that gets ignored completely. He's saying water shortages are inevitable if we take it as given that everyone is entitled to as much of it as they want and hiding the real costs with tax subsidies. \"Water is not a human right\" is true insofar as people don't have the right to take as much as they want and that is indeed what he was saying.\nLet-s_Do_This: Just watched the video. I can understand his sentiments if he said \"Water is not a right of commercial entities\", but he doesn't. He said that having access to water as a human being is an extreme view and that he is of the opinion it should be privatized. He then states that it's a CEO's responsibility to ensure the success of their company. Honestly, after watching the video I'm of the opinion that, like many CEO's, he is a psychopath. If morality is not a factor, it makes perfect sense for him to push that agenda.\nto_tomorrow: I hope you read my comment here in a state of open-mindedness for a moment and try to not feel attacked. I want to give this to you straight because you seem actually interested.\n\nGo back and reread your post for me after this paragraph. Notice you put an important word in your second sentence that your argument fully rests upon. \"Access.\" That word is required for your claim because preventing someone from accessing a resource is indeed immoral. It requires an oppressive force (like someone w/ guns) to choose who gets the resource and who does not. This may be overt, like a warlord capturing and distributing water from the Red Cross (common), or it may be less overt, like a government setting different price structures for different types of people: farmers pay $X per gallon, city dwellers pay $Y per gallon, and so on. The latter type of access-restriction is actually what is happening today.\n\nYour moral intuition is solid, but your self-awareness is not as solid because you did not notice the change you made in this argument. The CEO we're discussing was NOT claiming some people should be given access over others. In fact he's saying the opposite of that: that people should be allowed to trade water among themselves by way of making voluntary agreements with one another. That's what privatization is.\n\nAs for the morality of privatization in terms of human outcome. You presumably want an outcome where the people who most need water get it and those who don't need it less get less of it, and certainly those with nefarious or greedy intent get the least! Here's the thing: many economists make a persuasive argument that privatization does a MUCH better job of getting this outcome than the current quasi-socialist or corporatist systems where the government picks winners and losers.\n\nThere is much evidence for this, including the examples already mentioned about water-heavy agriculture thriving in drought-stricken areas. Many other examples are discussed in basic Econ classes and in more intense literature if you have the appetite for it. Agriculture subsidies, rent control, tariffs. Laws like these are (almost) always created with well-meaning justifications to help some defined set of the population: farmers, poor families, factory workers, etc., but the unintended consequences of trying to 'direct economic traffic' is often abysmal and ends up hurting the people they're trying to help--and many others.\n\nPhenomena like the California almond farms (takes 1.1 GALLONS of water to grow ONE almond!) would not happen if they were forced by the market to directly pay water providers, who who would be asking for a much higher price in areas where supply is low and demand is high. You can find cases where \"privatization\" is blamed for problems, such as the issues w/ Bechtel privatizing water in Bolivia (or was it Ecuador? I forget) and cops ended up going around kicking over people's rain collectors. That last part is what was screwed up! Privatization doesn't entail having government thugs go force people to buy from you--that's anti-privatization! The fact that they were doing this tells you there was government corruption involved, and that's typically the key component of privatization failure.\n\nI recommend reading about this stuff. It's interesting as hell, and you can find both conservative (&amp; fascinating) writers like Thomas Sowell articulating these arguments, as well as more socialist-leaning economists (Myrdal I think?) who nonetheless acknowledge realities of how markets work.\n", "prompt": "TSCon835: Lake Tahoe Gained 8.7 Billion Gallons Of Water In Just 2 Days\n\ndethtech: As the CEO of Nestle screams dibs.\nobidie: To be honest, it's not the Nestle guy, but the people who allow that asshole to monetize their water resources.

Thanks!\n\nDragon_Flags: Here's my two cents; I'm no expert but have been exercising (Endurance, Oly, Power, &amp; Calisthenics) under the guidance of a highly qualified Personal Trainer for a few years.\n\nSuper Sets are great.  Period.  I triple set when I eat, that's how amazing I think they are.  But know yourself by listening to your body.\n\nEat a light pre-game snack before.  Always eat afterwards, ALWAYS.\n\nWhat is Cardio?  The taxing of your heart and blood vessels.  Running in the morning is optimal.  Run when it's bitching cold, run when it rains.\n\nYes, your routine targets all the muscles.  But you have accessory exercises in which I feel are unnecessary, such as calf exercises and bicep exercises.  Unless you're doing this for \"show muscles\" they're a waste of time.  Large compound exercises will develop functional strength and train your motor skills.\n\nYour Monday as a compound of BW with Legs is overkill.  Legs deserve their own day.  Focus more on Squat Variations/Deadlift Variations/Glute Ham Raises/Sprints/Jumping.\n\nAre there any benefits to yoga or tai chi when it comes to Strength/Endurance/Fat Loss?  Yes, and more.\n\nDips or HSPU's?  Why not both?\n\nKeep up the good work!  Ask if you have any questions or need emphasis.\n161803398874989: &gt; What is Cardio? The taxing of your heart and blood vessels. Running in the morning is optimal. Run when it's bitching cold, run when it rains.\n\nI run much, much better in the evening because in the morning I'm not properly awake.\nDragon_Flags: 1. It's generally cooler in the morning than it is mid-afternoon, so the morning, or running at dusk, is the best time of day to head out in the Summer, unless you enjoy being chained to your treadmill.\n\n2. Most races take place in the morning, so you can get your body acclimated to the time of day that a race is being held.\n\n3. If you live on a busy street, there aren't as many cars on the road at 5 a.m.\n\n4. If you have a busy day ahead of you, you can get up early and just get your run done and out of the way, instead of waiting until later in the day, and then having to skip your workout.\n\n5.

The bottom of the frame is shown so you can see how the frame 2x4\u2019s are secured together.  Joists were placed at 16\u201d and 32\u201d from one (48\u201d) side for even spacing and support.  Cut your deck planks to 48\u201d and use your 1 5/8\u201d screws to secure the deck boards to the frame.  Don\u2019t bury your screws in your boards or they will have a lot higher likelihood of splitting which is not awesome.  Cut your front and back deck boards to accommodate your 2x4 posts for your walls if desired or you can simply place your posts on top and secure them down with 2 2 1/2\u201d screws for each wall post, in to the frame.  You are going to want to tape measure they spacing of your posts at the top, once you have them set.  You are screwing right in to the frame, so the tops of your wall posts should be very close to, if not right on, your 36\u201d x 48\u201d measurement from your foundation.  We aren\u2019t building missiles here so it\u2019s no biggie if you aren\u2019t 100% square and plum, but for ease of construction and generally good practice, you should be.\n\nPosts were cut to 32 1/2\u201d in the front and 31 1/2\u201d in the back to provide a gentle slope for water drainage as needed {and to make the front an even 36\u201d tall (remember, I cut my front and back deck boards out for the post.  If you don\u2019t do this, your measurement will be different to get a 36\u201d tall front of your dog house).  Back wall boards should be cut to 49\u201d (to allow a clean overlap so your corner looks nice and has minimal airflow).  Side boards shall be cut to 36\u201d each, 5 per side plus one more each side to rip down to accommodate for the slope in the roof.  You will see in the video that the tops of the side board (that I ripped down to accommodate for the slope) didn\u2019t match up with the front and the back boards.  This was later corrected on both sides.  2 cedar planks cut to 49\u201d for boards across the top of the front, 4 cedar planks cut to 28\u201d for the left of the door, and 4 cedar planks cut to 4\u201d for the right of the door.  Door opening will measure about 16\u201d wide and 20 1/2\u201d tall.  Screw 4 2x4 scraps inside to act as bracing for the roof supports.  Roof supports are 2x4\u2019s, cut to 36\u201d.  Secure the supports to the braces with 2 1/2\u201d screws, 8 needed for this step.  I cut the roof panels to 51\u201d to allow for a one inch overlap on the sides, once the side panels are installed.  As you can tell, we saved some money but using the tops of the pickets (which would have been waste) for roof pieces, and to give it a nice looking front &amp; top edge.  Line all of your panels up and screw them in place.  This dog house is under a covered patio so we aren\u2019t especially worried about water leakage at this point.

I'm judging that the ability to make crazy repeatable shapes isn't worth the computer maintenance and being married to a CAD system.\n\n\nAny opinions? Thoughts? The intended use is for my own robotics projects, so there will be a lot of aluminum, and some steel.\n[deleted]: I can't tell you much about machines today. My last experience was in my dad's jobbing shop as a lathe hand and screw machine operator with some setup experience when school was out for the summers that was almost 50 years ago when I started.\n\nBut every machine my dad bought would sit until he tuned it. He would rework everything on a machine until he was satisfied, and that included high end stuff like Bridgeport Mills and so on (although I suspect at least part of that was to get him out of the office). You can probably expect to have to do that with any of the tools that you buy at the price level you are talking about.\n\nI have faceted gems, and spent $3,000 on a faceting machine. The machining was more than disappointing. There were burrs, runout, and all sorts of problems on a device that needed to be good to better than a thousandth of an inch.

All I had to do was wire up a 240 circuit, and off I went.\neubarch: I think one of the big contributing factors to the performance of these machines is raw mass (which translates into rigidity).  Unfortunately, that's the one thing I cannot actually have until I get around to pouring a new slab outside my house and erecting a proper detached shop space.  \n[deleted]: Vibration is a major issue. The other two important ones that you will need to deal with are runout, backlash and the ways. Fixing them will solve most of your problems. There are are a lot of places on the web which will help you  on how to deal with these problems. Probably even forums on the particular machine that you buy.\n\nI have a cheap drill press that has a fair amount of runout, and I found out how to regrind the Morse taper (male and female) on the web a long time ago.

{"full_text": "aminalbackwards: I built a low-budget TV stand in my apartment\n\ncurebaldness: Looks great but you need a bigger TV to do the stand justice.\naminalbackwards: I got an itch for a 65\" that I really shouldn't scratch right now...\n\nThank you!\nBloodOnTheTracks: Look at the TCL 6 Series. The 65\" model has been on sale a lot lately and punches way above its price range.\naminalbackwards: I'm totally naive when it comes to TV's. What makes the 6 series better than say the cheapest thing at Walmart? Worth the extra few hundred bucks?\nBloodOnTheTracks: Hey, sorry for the latent reply! I recently did a lot of research on TVs, buying my own last year. The 6 Series received lots of praise from reviewers. They've been out about 6 months, so the price has dropped (they can be had in the $600-700 range on sale, versus the $999 launch price). The 6 Series offers 4k, HDR, Dolby Vision and a great Roku operating system. It also looks more expensive than it is, with a handsome metal bezel. \n\nThe real value proposition is that it rivals TVs costing twice as much in terms of picture quality. Anecdotally, I bought a great 65\" Sony last year as my main TV, but also ended up buying a 55\" TCL 6 Series for a small den a few months later. After owning the two over the last 6 months, I can say the TCL is a hell of a lot of picture quality for the price. The Sony is great and I don't regret it, but if I had to replace it, I'd save myself half the cash and buy a 65\" TCL 6 Series and not look back! \n\nThis advice really only applies if you care about things like color accuracy, HDR performance and you stream a lot of newer content from Netflix/Hulu/Amazon (which all increasingly support 4k HDR &amp; Dolby Vision content). If you don't care about that sort thing, the cheapest 65\" at Walmart will probably be the TCL 4 Series, which isn't half bad either. Just wanted to plug the 6 Series because it's one of those golden products that is really hard to beat for the price. It's rare to find something that is the best in its price category.\naminalbackwards: Thanks for all the detail. Sounds like either way a TCL is a good buy. I definitely want to do my research. Is the HDR you're talking about the same as HDR in photography? For a casual TV watcher would you say the extra $200-300 for the 6 is worth it? I also saw a 65\" curved samsung at Target on clearance for $650 iirc. Thoughts on something like that?\nBloodOnTheTracks: If it is the UN7300, that's a great price, but personally, I don't love the curved screens. Someone mentioned the site RTings and that really is a great resource for TV shopping. They ranked the Samsung at 7.5 and the TCL at 8.0, just to give you some idea. I think the TCL is still their reigning \"budget\" champion. [Here's a review to get started](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/6-series-r617-2018).\n\nOh and yes, HDR is similar that in photography. Still means high dynamic range. It's a newer content format mean to show a greater range of color and brightness. For TVs that support HDR, this generally means they're capable of a wide color gamet but also capable of hitting higher peak brightness. So in a movie scene where you see the sun or bright headlights, a TV with good HDR performance will make you feel blinded. Most of Netflix's original content is HDR. Once you're accustomed to it, non-HDR content will seem a little dull!\naminalbackwards: Okay another question. I hate when movies and shows play at 30fps instead of 24fps (other than things like news, documentaries, stuff like that). It seems like a lot of newer TVs that friends have automatically play movies in 30fps, which I hate cause it makes the movie look cheaply made to me. My understanding is that this is based on refresh rate. Is this something that can be changed in the settings of a newer TV, or do most TVs have a fixed rate? It seems nitpicky, but it's always bothered me to watch a movie in 30fps. Thanks.\nBloodOnTheTracks: That's usually caused more by the \"motion smoothing\" features found in most modern TVs. It is sometimes called the Soap Opera Effect. It can be nice for sports (gives it that \"you're actually there\" sort of look), but it is [widely hated by lots of people including directors.](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/12/17849560/tv-motion-smoothing-reference-mode-nolan-anderson) Annoying, most TV manufacturers have it turned on automatically, so lots of people think that's just how they're TV looks. I turn motion smoothing (and it usually has specific names on different TVs; Sony calls it MotionFlow) off on any TV I own and use whatever \"cinema\" mode they have as the basis for setting up the default picture. I usually do it to family members' TVs, too, if it is someone who I know won't ever question the way their TV looks (like my mom).

He had a collar with a tag on it that was essentially a bell bcuz it had two tags and was loud af, he started going outside less and wasn\u2019t hunting as much, he always scratched at it trying to get it off, and then one day he somehow unclipped it, he was running around the house and outside playing with his toys happiest we\u2019ve seen him since we put the collar on, so we just didn\u2019t put it back on.\nDakotaEE: Cats are invasive and [absolutely horrible for any environment they are introduced to. ](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380) Not to even mention the fact that [free roam cat's life expectancy is 1/3 of an indoor cat's.](https://www.petmd.com/cat/care/can-indoor-cat-be-part-time-outdoor-cat) So really, by letting cat's free roam you hurt the ecosystem and put your pet in easily avoidable danger.\nExtreme-Ad2812: My sisters cat was free roam and lived till she was 19, who knew a cat lives to 60 years old.. /s. my brothers gf is a vet, and my mother has a PHD in environmental science\u2026 please don\u2019t try and explain this to me lmao, your 10 minutes of google research doesn\u2019t negate what others who are actually qualified in the field have told me.

I'm intimately familiar with biotech patents and would be happy to point you to whatever you'd like.\nEurgh: Is there much weight to the idea that you could be sued for having an unpaid for patented gene? I mean that seems like an incredibly odd and hard thing to police. Additionally would we ever see every gene patented? What would that mean for further research etc?\n\nAlso, thanks!\n\n(Edited to say thanks.)\nAngryFox: Good questions, and this goes to the question posted by another above asking how are genes patentable to begin with.\n\nInitially, there is NO chance for someone to be found guilty of patent infringement for naturally possessing a patented gene. The primary reason for this is a result of the nature of the \"gene\" that is patented (you'll discover why I'm putting \"gene\" in quotes below).  *EDIT: Also, while cells, microorganisms, plants, and mice, etc. are patentable subject matter, humans are not (35 U.S.C. 101).*\n\nAt present, \"gene patents\" exist because of a minor distinction between what is actually patented and what exists in nature.  To understand this distinction you have to understand what a gene is.  The hierarchal structure of DNA could be described like this: genome &gt; gene &gt; exons + introns. (There's an additional caveat to this but as it has never been legally addressed I'm going to bypass it).  When a typical gene is expressed in a cell a copy of the gene in the genome (which is made of DNA) is made.  This copy is made from RNA, which comprises different building blocks than that used to make DNA.  This RNA copy is then processed to remove the introns.  The final copy is called mRNA and can be used as the template to make protein.\n\nNow, the composition (or \"gene\") that is ACTUALLY claimed in a patent is technically something that is none of these things (i.e., not found in nature) and, therefore, patentable.  Through a biochemical trick it is possible to take the mRNA for a gene and make a direct copy BACK into DNA (remember, different building blocks).  However, this copy (called cDNA) doesn't have any of the original introns in it (as those were processed out of the mRNA).  As a result, you have a DNA molecule comprising only exons and it is this molecule, in isolation, which is what is claimed in virtually all \"gene patents.\"\n\nIf you were to put a copy of this cDNA into a cell it would be treated no differently than the original from which it was copied: the cDNA would get expressed and processed into mRNA, only the cell would simply skip over the intron-processing step because there aren't any.  Everything else (and the downstream results, i.e., protein and function) are identical.  It is because of this that I believe the argument used to support \"gene patents,\" which is that the patented \"gene\" is wholely-unique from the naturally-occuring original gene, is merely a distinction without a difference.  If you took the sentence \"See [BLANK] Spot [BLANK] run\" from this paragraph and then you wrote the sentence \"See Spot run\" alone and in French elsewhere, can you honestly say you've created something novel and non-obvious?  Regardless, it's enough to keep the courts content.\n\nAs for whether a patent for every gene is inevitable I believe the answer depends only on whether a novel and non-obvious use can be found for every gene.  A utility patent must first-and-foremost be useful.  While the bar for this is low, there are thousands of known genes with known functions that aren't patented.  This fact guarantees that these genes (at least for their known functions) are in the public domain and, thus, are freely useable for these purposes (including research).\n\nI hope I've answered your questions.

{"full_text": "HridaySabz: Traveling: What's the fascination?\n\nPalentir: What a load of bunk.\n\nMost people who travel go to large modern cities or tourist towns, places where \"local, exotic culture\" is quite often pre chewed by the large number of other tourists who have gone before you.  You don't need to be able to read or speak the local language because most of the people living there have enough English to answer your questions and the signs and menus will be in English.

That's if you're not counting all of the common foods that are essentially global now (hamburgers, hot dogs, fried chicken, coffee, tea, colas, and beer) that are available almost anywhere.  The short version is that the waitstaff serving American tourists has probably done more to adapt to the tourists than the tourists have to adapt to them.

You think the \"Indian\" food you get to taste in the States is anywhere near what you have in India? \n\nAlso, your reference to \"large modern cities\", the blog doesn't even talk about the fact that you need to learn a new language. It talks about how being in a foreign land, you get to experience things differently, as in the sights and sounds etc. Most real travellers (not the Instagram \"travelholics\") want to experience new things, and many backpackers opt to stay in smaller, less frequented places as a result.\n\nIt also makes reference to the fact that people travel to escape work.

If you went to a local tourist spot in downtown Dehli, you might think it's authentic, but it's geared to tourists who come to India to see \"authentic \" Indian culture and eat authentic Indian food while ignoring that they are doing so in a place that makes millions of dollars in the tourism business and know how to cater to American adventure seekers.  Tourism is a major industry.  \n\nAnd as I said, most of the tourists I know who visit other countries are doing exactly that.  They go to Cancun or Puerta Vallarta, San Juan, or Tokyo or Seoul.  Places that every American visiting those countries goes to.  Many of them never leave the downtown area for more than a day.  So you essentially see the Disney version of those cultures where it's all made to look unique while being completely chewed on to not offend American sensibility or tastebuds.

{"full_text": "p00trulz: Full house reno complete!\n[https://imgur.com/a/F2F2wcY](https://imgur.com/a/F2F2wcY)\n\nWe bought this house last June and after 10 months we are done!  The house had been a rental for most of its life and was aesthetically extremely rough.  \n\nFirst thing we did was cover up all the beige paint with Elemental from Home Depot prior to tearing out the old floors.  This way we didn't have to worry about paint drops or spills.  \n\nStarting with the kitchen, we cut out the drywall that the old tile backsplash was on, hung new drywall and installed a mosaic tile backsplash using Mussel Bound adhesive mat.  While we had the old backsplash and drywall out, I flipped the switch for the pantry light from outside the pantry to inside the pantry.  Since the door hinges on the side that the lightswitch was on, if you opened the door before turning on the light, you had to close the door again to reach the switch.  Not well thought out.  My wife painted the cabinets and I installed a new dishwasher.  We contracted the Quartz countertops and extended the overhang for the bar by about 6 inches and had the counterop guys install a single-basin undermount sink.  I put in the faucet and a new garbage disposal and reran the plumbing to go from double-basin to single. easy enough to do but working with PVC solvent under the cabinet gave me a headache.  We replaced all the hinges and drawer sliders with soft close ones.  Shortly after, the bottoms of some of the drawers started falling out.  Turns out, the old sliders mounted on the bottom also supported the drawer bottoms.  When we changed the sliders to the new side-mounted ones the little staples couldn't hold on.  I glued them back on and secured them with small screws and they've been great since.\n\nI ripped up all the nasty old carpet that had been there since the house was built in the early 2000s.  Upstairs, I installed Pergo Outlast Plus laminate after pulling out all the staples, screwing down the subfloor to fix squeaks, and pulling off the baseboards.  Since we were living in the house, I did one room at a time and saved the hallway between them for last.  This meant I had to put in T-molds at all of the door ways.  If I were doing it again I would start in one corner of one room and do the entire thing as one unit to eliminate the transitions, but I guess this way there is more room for expansion.  I got a cordless oscillating multi tool to cut around the door casings where I needed to and to make the small cuts around closet shelves, doorways, and HVAC registers.  \n\nIn the walk-out basement, I installed Shaw LVP due to past water intrusion.  I traced the source of the water to a poorly routed sump discharge and gutter downspout that drained right next to the foundation and uphill from the basement door. Water was pooling by the door and coming in during heavy rainfall. To fix that problem I ran 40 feet of drain pipe from the downspout out into the yard in a hand dug trench and tied the sump discharge into it. I also cut out the basement door threshhold and replaced it.  Problem solved.\u00a0\n\nI replaced all of the ceiling fans except for the living room, and all all of the light fixtures. Again, straight forward other than one upstairs hall light where I had to put in a new box to lower it about 1/2 an inch so the light base would sit flush against the ceiling.\u00a0\n\nThe guest bathroom and laundry room upstairs got LVT floors. The guest bathroom had some rotten subfloor that I cut out and replaced and a new toilet flange. I also replaced the vanity and added a sliding shower door. Previously there had just been a curtain which is why the subfloor was rotten.\u00a0 One thing to watch out for with vanities that I learned is to check where the existing plumbing comes out of the wall. On mine it was too low for the integrated shelf in the new vanity so I had to notch it to make it fit.\u00a0\n\nThe final project was the master bath. I took out the old linoleum and vanity and put in marble LVT and a new 72\u201d granite top vanity. I measured the vanity at the base and marked it out on the floor so I could lay the tile perfectly up to the base.  Other than replacing leaky shutoffs this went without a hitch. I found it easier to cut the tile with the multi tool instead of a utility knife. I replaced the toilet and then ripped out the old shower insert while my wife painted the tub. For the new shower I went with a delta 3-piece system. With that in, straight forward according to the instructions, I replaced the drywall up to the new surround and used Trim Tec shower bead to get a crisp mud line before sealing with silicone. I hung new mirrors from Lowes, but didn't trust the single screw hanging point that came with it so I put a few healthy gobs of construction adhesive on the backs to keep them in place.  Due to time constraints I contracted the shower door.\u00a0 The access doors for the tub motor had busted hinges and we had trouble finding new ones that worked so I used a small bead of silicone to glue them to the surround.  If they need to come off in the future for maintenance, it shouldn't take more than a razor blade to free them.\nPatches_O_Houlihan69: I think they should have just ended the series instead of trying to translate the show to a new location.

CMV\nNow, this is going to be somewhat of a tricky CMV because it's based on \"taste\" to some extent. I simply do not have any interest in politics and I don't feel guilty or uneducated because of this. Politics, elections, laws, policies, everything about it bores me to death. And I'm perfectly okay with this. \n\nMaybe it's because I don't see how politics directly affects me; maybe it's because I don't feel I can have any impact on it. Or it could just be that my brain isn't wired to care. People have different interests, and no one calls someone uneducated or ignorant for refusing to learn about food science or textiles.\n\nAnyway, I have neither the desire nor the need to follow and learn about politics. So, change my view! Make me care!\n\nEdit: Everyone had really great replies! At this point, I definitely see the benefit of caring about and involving myself in small scale politics. However, I still don't particularly see the point of memorizing how larger scale politics work (ie. how the Supreme Court Justices are decided, how laws are passed by congress, etc.) so this is still up for discussion.\nwatrenu: You know how they say \"The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything\"? That's the main argument against the kind of political apathy you feel. If you decide to not care, well then you have to live with the fact that other people will decide how you live your life.\n\nI understand finding it boring and not obsessing about politics like some people are inclined to do, but voting (at the minimum) is a civic duty of utmost importance. Politics are not a hobby, like food science or textiles, it's more like paying your taxes or sending your children to school. Law enforcement and the courts don't care about how you feel about politics, they will enforce the laws that other people have decided for you, if you decide to never voice your opinion/do something.\n\nAlso it is important to remember an individual's role in politics is certainly not restricted to casting a vote for the president once every four years. Every dollar you spend is a vote, remember this. Every minute you spend reading/watching media is a vote cast. Civil disobedience, boycotting, lobbying, running for office, strikes, protests, violent revolutions, those are all ways of impacting the political landscape ( I am not advocating a violent revolution but I just want to point out that when you let others decide the law for you on the basis of it being boring, people get mad and when it gets to that point, you don't vote the tyrant out of office, you shoot them. see for example: French Revolution, American Revolution, First Balkan War, [etc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revolutions_and_rebellions))\n\nso try and at least vote, it's really really really important for you not to throw away the gift of liberty that was fought for by the founders of America.\n\n\" What country ever existed a century and a half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? **The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants**. It is it's natural manure. \" -Thomas Jefferson to William Stephens Smith, Paris, 13 Nov. 1787\n\nsorry if this is kind of incoherent\n[deleted]: &gt;If you decide to not care, well then you have to live with the fact that other people will decide how you live your life.\n\nTrue, but caring doesn't mean I will have any effect on how politics affect my life. In fact, it's probably one of the few areas where how much I care has virtually no effect on how I live my life. Everything we do in influenced by other people: what we wear, what we eat, what we read, what we watch, how we exercise, what we buy, when we work, what careers we choose, who we trust. These are all things that we can change for ourselves, or we can let society choose for us. With politics, it seems to me to be more of society choosing for us; I guess I don't see how I can *really* affect anything without becoming a politician. With everything else in my life I can do my own research and decide for myself if I want to put the effort in. It's worth it to me.\n\n&gt;Politics are not a hobby, like food science or textiles, it's more like paying your taxes or sending your children to school.\n\nI legally have to pay taxes and send my children to school (or homeschool them at least.) I do not legally need to learn politics.\n\n&gt;they will enforce the laws that other people have decided for you, if you decide to never voice your opinion/do something.\n\nDo you have an example of a time when you changed a law that drastically affects you? I honestly just don't think I have that capability unless, again, I become a politician. Voting doesn't count. I mean do I actually have the capability to have a significant influence on the laws in my city/state/country without actually becoming a politician?\n\n&gt;Civil disobedience, boycotting, lobbying, running for office, strikes, protests, violent revolutions, those are all ways of impacting the political landscape\n\nHmm, this brings up a good point. I guess I was viewing politics as congress passing laws, presidential debates, all that jazz. I guess I can see how I'd be able to have an influence on very small scale politics, perhaps if I was part of a union for example. I never considered that \"politics\" per se, but I suppose it is. It doesn't mean that I would find it fascinating by any means, but perhaps I can see why I'd at least need to educate myself on how these things function. I still don't see the point in concerning myself with large scale issues (ie. anything larger than a very small town.)\n\n&gt;so try and at least vote\n\nHonestly, if I have absolutely no idea how congress works, I probably shouldn't be voting. I mean, I'll definitely vote for certain issues (I'll vote for gay marriage, for example) but I don't know enough to decide on anything more complex. And I know it's cliche, but I feel my vote really just doesn't matter.\nDivinityfound: &gt; I mean, I'll definitely vote for certain issues (I'll vote for gay marriage, for example) but I don't know enough to decide on anything more complex.

I touched on this a bit in another comment. Basically, I care that gays have the right to marry, work, etc. but I'm not really concerned about the actual *politics* behind how that would happen.

But why stop there ? Is time a constraint ?\n\nYou can strengthen pretty much the whole body if you add in progressions for horizontal push(PPPUs) and pull (Tuck lever rows) to your current routine which already has vertical push, pull and legs. You might have to split up the days into push/pull days like in the recommend routine or into verical/horizontal days (my current routine) with rest days inbetween. \n\nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Train everything so that there are no weak links. The choice is upto you though :)\nihatepepperballs: Back and forearms/wrists are my biggest weakness right now, so that's what I'm focusing on.\n\nBy the way: how could I split this into two parts? I would like to do the first half in the morning, then the second one in the afternoon.\n\nThanks for the input :)\nn3ox1ne: Its a 2 day split. For example, Monday would be horizontal day with pushups/rows/core. Tuesday would be rest day and Wednesday would be vertical day with pullups/dips(will move to hspu after getting good stable handstands)/legs. Thursday would be rest and Friday would be horizontal again and it just repeats like that every day, rest, train, rest.\n\nThis is my personal routine modified from the recommend one.

I want action, dammit :D\n\nAre you sure it would be more beneficial to split it into two days when I could do the whole thing in one?\nn3ox1ne: Your recovery time will have to increase especially after progressing to the intermediate movements. The tendons and joints will need more rest between sessions. Otherwise you will overtrain the body and get injured. Remember this is not a race. Take it slow and stay injury free.

It has been represented by the Greek letter \"\u03c0\" since the mid-18th century though it is also sometimes spelled out as \"__pi__\" (/pa\u026a/).\n\n&gt;Being an [irrational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number), \u03c0 cannot be expressed exactly as a [common fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_fraction), although fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to approximate \u03c0. Consequently its [decimal representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_representation) never ends and never [settles into a permanent repeating pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal). The digits appear to be randomly distributed although no proof of this has yet been discovered. Also, \u03c0 is a [transcendental number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number)\u00a0\u2013 a number that is not the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_polynomial) of any nonzero [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) having [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number) [coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient). This [transcendence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number) of \u03c0 implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of [squaring the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle) with a compass and straight-edge.\n\n&gt;For thousands of years mathematicians have attempted to extend their understanding of \u03c0, sometimes by computing its value to a high degree of accuracy. Before the 15th century mathematicians such as [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes) and [Liu Hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Hui) used geometrical techniques, based on polygons, to estimate the value of \u03c0. Starting around the 15th century, new algorithms based on [infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series) revolutionized the computation of \u03c0. In the 20th and 21st centuries mathematicians and [computer scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) discovered new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of \u03c0 to, as of late 2011, over 10 trillion (10^13) digits.  Scientific applications generally require no more than 40 digits of \u03c0 so the primary motivation for these computations is the human desire to break records but the extensive calculations involved have been used to test [supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) and high-precision multiplication [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms).\n\n&gt;Because its definition relates to the circle, \u03c0 is found in many formulae in [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry) and [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry), especially those concerning circles, ellipses or spheres. It is also found in formulae used in other branches of science such as [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology), [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal), [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics), [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics) and [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism). The ubiquity of \u03c0 makes it one of the most widely-known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community: Several books devoted to it have been published, the number is celebrated on [Pi Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day) and record-setting calculations of the digits of \u03c0 often result in news headlines. Attempts to memorize the value of \u03c0 with increasing precision have led to records of over 67,000 digits.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/LUfrRcW.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pi_eq_C_over_d.svg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Pi ^\\(letter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_\\(letter\\)) ^| [^Pi ^\\(film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_\\(film\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+chm02pq) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+chm02pq)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)\n[deleted]: &gt; Attempts to memorize the value of \u03c0 with increasing precision have led to records of over 67,000 digits.\n\nWhat a complete waste of time.\n", "prompt": "[deleted]: Pi\n\nDont_trust_them: ELI5\nOokami-07: If you have a circle that has a [diameter](http://www.sleewee.com/images/diameter-circle.gif) of one, then the [circumference](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/5-17-12_Circumference-of-a-Circle1.jpg) is [Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi), or approximately 3.14. \n\nAnd now we've come full circle\nautowikibot:", "orig": "#####&amp;#009;\n\n######&amp;#009;\n\n####&amp;#009;\n [**Pi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;The number __\u03c0__ is a [mathematical constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant), the [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio) of a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle)'s [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference) to its [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter", "generated": "Ah, excellent explanation, Ookami-07!

Do you have any examples of what she is doing wrong and why?\nHermemes: It's not unfair, it's exactly what she's doing here. Let me quote from a transcript that I've found. \n\n&gt; Before you come to ethics, you must answer the questions posed by metaphysics and epistemology: Is man a rational being, able to deal with reality \u2014 or is he a helplessly blind misfit, a chip buffeted by the universal flux? Are achievement and enjoyment possible to man on earth \u2014 or is he doomed to failure and distaste? Depending on the answers, you can proceed to consider the questions posed by ethics: What is good or evil for man \u2014 and why? Should man's primary concern be a quest for joy \u2014 or an escape from suffering? Should man hold self-fulfillment \u2014 or self-destruction \u2014 as the goal of his life? Should man pursue his values \u2014 or should he place the interests of others above his own? Should man seek happiness \u2014 or self-sacrifice?\n\nThis series of polar questions all summarize the polar relationship between her image of the heroic man against her image of the villainous man. These aren't the basic questions of ethics and I consider it ethically wrong to present them as such. \n\nIn fact, the thesis of the speech seems to be that everyone needs philosophy solely for the opportunity to affirm Rand's conclusions. \naynrandfan: Those aren't the basic questions of ethics--she says so in the part you quoted! Reread it yourself. She says that certain philosophical issues and positions presuppose ethics. Are you saying that these questions are false or in fact not important to the study of ethics?\n\nYou are making baseless, loaded assumptions. She doesn't jump to a discussion of heroes and villains in this talk.\n\nYou are incorrect about the thesis. You should listen to the lecture or read it (there is a book and essay by the same name, and the essay is simply the transcript of the lecture) before commenting on the thesis.\n\nIn fact, you must have already found the article.

Reread it yourself. She says that certain philosophical issues and positions presuppose ethics.\n\nShe implies that they are in introducing those questions by saying, \"... you can proceed to consider the questions posed by ethics:\"\n\n&gt; You are making baseless, loaded assumptions. She doesn't jump to a discussion of heroes and villains in this talk.\n\nWith those dyadic questions, she obviously poses the possibility of two moral conclusions: one being good and the other being evil. She says nothing more of ethics. I don't want to continue this discussion if you are only going to play the irrational contrarian. \n\n&gt; You are incorrect about the thesis. You should listen to the lecture or read it (there is a book and essay by the same name, and the essay is simply the transcript of the lecture) before commenting on the thesis.\n\nI arrived at this conclusion after reading the transcript. The way she makes straw men of past philosophers, especially Kant, in the following quote proves as much.\n\n&gt;\"Don't be so sure \u2014 nobody can be certain of anything.\" You got that notion from David Hume (and many, many others), even though you might never have heard of him. Or: \"This may be good in theory, but it doesn't work in practice.\" You got that from Plato. Or: \"That was a rotten thing to do, but it's only human, nobody is perfect in this world.\" You got that from Augustine. Or: \"It may be true for you, but it's not true for me.\" You got it from William James. Or: \"I couldn't help it! Nobody can help anything he does.\" You got it from Hegel. Or: \"I can't prove it, but I feel that it's true.\" You got it from Kant. Or: \"It's logical, but logic has nothing to do with reality.\" You got it from Kant. Or: \"It's evil, because it's selfish.\" You got it from Kant.\n\n\n&gt; In fact, you must have already found the article. Read it. You will find that you are in error or ignoring or forgetting what she is saying.\n\nI am doing none of these things but, in your apologetics, I necessarily must because it is the first dogma of objectivism that Ayn Rand can never be in error. You've made no empirical point in any of your reply and only rely on this vacuous, contrary rhetoric. I'm sure you'll tell me that you haven't. In that case, I will be satisfied that I am correct in my assessment. \n\nIn other words, I doubt your defense is detached enough to make any substantial point and I'll simply let those third parties who read this exchange to decide for themselves. \naynrandfan: &gt;\"She implies that they are in introducing those questions by saying, .\"... &gt;you can proceed to consider the questions posed by ethics:\"\"\n\n&gt;With those dyadic questions, she obviously poses the possibility of &gt;two moral conclusions: one being good and the other being evil. She &gt;says nothing more of ethics. I don't want to continue this discussion &gt;if you are only going to play the irrational contrarian.\n\nShe correctly says that there are certain essential questions on which ethics rests, and when it comes to the field of ethics, there are certain major questions, which she states. This isn't all she has to say about ethics. Her main ethical essay is The Objectivist Ethics which is free for viewing here:http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ari_ayn_rand_the_objectivist_ethics\n\nIf you want her essential treatment of ethics, it is there. Other than that, for your position to hold water, you'd have to give an argument for why those aren't important ethics questions, or why those questions are flawed.\n\nMaybe in this talk that is all she says about ethics (which I am very sure is not the case, but I will take it for granted for now), but you have to see the thesis of the entire lecture--that man needs philosophy in order to live. She isn't trying to prove her ethical theories here.\n\nAnd yes, with those questions, there is a right/good answer and a wrong/evil answer. What is the problem with that?\n\nI am not being an \"irrational contrarian\"--you are implying that Ayn Rand is wrong when she is in fact not. And you are mischaracterizing her. I am pointing to facts, i.e. empirical knowledge, that you are in the wrong. If you keep the context, you were the one who made the original comment, and I am defending an unjust mischaracterization of her. You are the one who started the \"contrary rhetoric\" and I am showing that you are not proving your case.\n\n&gt;\"the first dogma of objectivism that Ayn Rand can never be in error\"\nDo you have any proof for this insulting claim?\n\nSpeaking of how one should make empirical points to make one's case, how is it that Rand is making straw men of the philosophers you quoted?\n\nAre you implying that you are \"detached\" enough from your dislike of Ayn Rand to make \"any substantial point\"?\n\nSure, I welcome third parties to view this. I think that if one is going to criticize someone, one should address what they actually say, and prove that he or she is wrong using some sort of argument. You have failed to do this. Until someone does this, I won't be responding. And I will not respond to insults either.\n\nHermemes: You've written this:\n\n&gt;Those aren't the basic questions of ethics--she says so in the part you quoted!\n\nThen you've written this:\n\n&gt; She correctly says that there are certain essential questions on which ethics rests, and when it comes to the field of ethics, there are certain major questions, which she states.\n\nWhich is it? Either these are fundamental questions of ethics or they are not. They cannot be both. \n\n&gt; Maybe in this talk that is all she says about ethics\n\nMy response is obviously addressing this speech and not Rand's moral philosophy in general. \n\n&gt; And yes, with those questions, there is a right/good answer and a wrong/evil answer. What is the problem with that?\n\nThey present a [false dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma) that ignores the complexity of ethics in order to re-envision it as a struggle between Ayn Rand and everyone else. \n\n&gt; Speaking of how one should make empirical points to make one's case, how is it that Rand is making straw men of the philosophers you quoted?\n\nShe's making straw men by literally putting words in their mouths that represent Rand's own conclusions on their philosophies with no charity to the substance of their work. Hume's critique of induction or William James' pragmatism are not reducible to those non-quotes.  \n\n&gt; I am not being an \"irrational contrarian\"--you are implying that Ayn Rand is wrong when she is in fact not.

You are the one who started the \"contrary rhetoric\" and I am showing that you are not proving your case.\n\nYes, you are. I've made an accurate observation of Rand's bias in her section on ethics and, through extension, the whole of the speech. At best, you've waffled on the point of importance of her questions to the subject of ethics and admitted that she characterizes ethics as a binary opposition. Otherwise, you've only stated the contrary and accused me of ignorance, i.e. you're made no facts.\n\n\n&gt; And I will not respond to insults either.\n\nThere have not been any insults in my reply, unless you mean to suggest that the very act of criticizing Ayn Rand is an insult to you which I can only guess is what you are referring to given the general character of your replies. \n", "prompt": "aynrandfan: Why Everyone Needs Philosophy.\n\nHermemes: Of course, when it comes to ethics, Ayn Rand divides it in a series of either/or questions that essentially rhetorically make the same point: are you an objectivist or are you a suicidal idiot?\naynrandfan: That's very unfair to her.

I thought it might be a flexibility issue, but I've developed decent flexibility in my ankles at this point. Then I thought balance, so I added 8lbs in front of me and was able to perform my reps perfectly. \n\n\nShould I continue to use the weight as I go lower and lower until it's just the floor, or should I continue using the weight until I can do then without it at my current box height, then go down and repeat?\n\n\n**2.** I'm doing the startbodyweight routine, and one of the issues I've seen is that it is imbalanced with 3 pushes and 2 pulls. I haven't noticed any issues in this regard. I do BJJ and there is a lot of pulling involved. Could this potentially balance out the push-pull? Is there another pull I can add to balance things? Should I add extra sets of my pulls?\ncuriouscalisthenist: 1. Use minimal weight, get full ROM, then reduce weights. Or try doing assisted pistols, holding to some pole or pushing off of a bench.\n\n2. Keep 1 for each vert/hori push/pull.

If you still want to add something, I guess you'd be fine with adding another set or two of a different variation of pull ups I suppose.

{"full_text": "P0werPuppy: YSK that OCD is a real condition, and can get quite severe. Saying \"This really triggers my OCD\" is actually quite silly.\n[removed]\n[deleted]: If a person says that, but do not have what is clinically labelled OCD, they are still referencing a valid feeling they have, and are using words they know in frames of reference they know. Incorrectly maybe, but to them it is a level of compulsion that is valid.\n\nIf one feels that these people are belittling the condition of 'true' sufferers, consider this: by suggesting that someone shouldn't use a term because they do may not have the strictest, truest definition of the condition as you understand it, you may inadvertently deter someone from considering if they may, in fact, suffer from it, or from something similar to it, and not seeking the help they need.\n\nThe truth as I understand it, as I understand it, is that all medical diagnoses and amateur self reflections are highly abstracted ways of describing states and processes of cognition that are not really easily described with words, yet its what we use, and so are always highly inaccurate, if useful.\n[deleted]: What I mean to say is, as long as a registered doctor isn't throwing the term around, I think we can forgive its colloquial misuse.\n\nIf someone says that something is triggering their OCD, I assume that they would like something done differently. And in that respect, it is exactly the information I need regardless of whether it's coming from someone with a confirmed diagnosis or not.\nP0werPuppy: I agree that self diagnosis, as well as visiting the doctor to confirm it is a brilliant way to learn more about yourself, and conditions. I do it a lot. I honestly don't think we can forgive it, once told. Most of them do not have OCD, but are annoyed at, for example, their desk being jumbled up. Or an upside down pencil in a pencil pot. These are completely normal things to do, and sprout from our species need for things to be asthetically pleasing. \n\nWhen people say it (most of the time, current use) they just mean something ticks them off. If however you know they do display OCD-like symptoms, such as ordering pencils for hours, immense stress, many strange daytime routines, then yes, go for it, they might have OCD and should get a check up.\n[deleted]: I didn't make my point correctly. If we can't allow people to fumble their words, clumsily use jargon they've heard, then we might as well not talk at all. Words are abstractions with reference to phenomena that that will never be precise. There is no such thing as OCD, or Bipolar, or Psychopathy and the rest. These are just our current best approximations to complex psychological processes that no doubt in fifty years we will have refined beyond recognition. \n\nIt can't be solely be up to the speaker to always be precise to their meaning, especially if they aren't in the field where the phrase originates. You could expect someone to be have read into the etymology of every word they use. But we can't learn everything. The listener has to do some of the legwork. You know what that person means when they say that triggers my OCD. You can choose to hear \"man, I really need to have my surroundings in a certain way, or I just cannot relax\" or you can choose to hear \"haha, man my OCD is flaring up, I'm so crazy, I should be in a mental asylum.\" for some people, exaggeration is a way of getting people to understand them. I much prefer someone overstate their needs than understate. I find it easier to dial down their intent when I process their request.\nP0werPuppy: You made this point even worse honestly. OCD, bipolarity, and in the extreme of extreme cases psychopathy, are not psychological processes, they are conditions. You are essentially saying we are all psychopaths, just by that wording.\n\nIf it is a medical condition, then they have an objective need to know the meaning, and not throw it around. You don't need to know all words, just don't misuse medical conditions, simple as. The first example is described similarly to OCD, but it is more extreme. The second example seems like you are implying that OCD sufferers belong in an insane asylum. In this case, exaggeration is the single worst thing you can do. I would much prefer they say the truth than overstate. If you are worried about them, tell them. Imagine a class of 20 people all saying the phrase. They probably don't have it. It occurs in around 2% of patients. So that's 1/50. Imagine an office with 50 people in. Only one of them would actually have OCD. Imagine the stress you would be causing them, just by saying that. If they do extreme versions of these, of course, then they should see a doctor.\n[deleted]: I am hearing that you are concerned with the exact use of 'OCD.' we're talking at cross purposes then. I am talking more generally that it is impossible that we, generally, all peoples I mean, could always use words the way we all would like them to be used. And we have to suck it up and shut up, or, more generously and patiently *re-interpret* what people say.\n\nIf someone tells me that 'something is triggering their OCD' , I don't take that to mean they are self diagnosing an actual condition. A condition that references to psychological processes, to clap back thank you very much. I take it to mean as best I understand what they are intending to put across.\n\nBesides, it's so commonplace that OCD is used incorrectly, that I imagine psychologists will revise the nomenclature before long, and they class will ironically then be using it correctly. Literally.\nP0werPuppy: May I remind you that this is a medical condition? Most people that say it are not obsessive and compulsive. We shouldn't reinterpret it in this case. We should tell them so they can learn, and it doesn't happen again.\n[deleted]: Is it tho\nP0werPuppy: YES, IT IS. I don't understand why you are so insistent on it being ok.\n[deleted]: You're not going to believe this. But I've got OCD. Really I do. And it's not the flippant one. It's most pronounced during the depressive phase of bipolar. Now, I don't have an actual diagnosis for OCD, but I do for bipolar. I've been in hospital three times but they were during the manic episodes where the OCD isn't symptomatic at all.\n\nI keep my hair shaved because I will constantly knot it. My fingernails are down to the bone. I cannot complete videogames becuase each save file has to be just so. If you played Breath of the Wild, you'll know of the hero's path feature. I can't even begin to explain how I had to plan my routes so that it looked... I dunno... Proper? I will throw workbooks away at the slightest misstep. I will keep a practise workbook that I then rewrite in the actual workbook. I will drop friends and delete accounts and restart everything again in the hope that I can do it *perfectly*\n\nAnyway, I say all this to prove my sincerity. For the longest time I didn't think this was OCD. Because I thought OCD was where you are overly hygienic or irrationally believe that if you don't do something a certain number of times something bad happens. Those are symptoms, but they're not mine. I don't get that. When I brought all this up with the gp as I have in this post, I was told it was a type of OCD. He isn't a psychologist though so I don't want to claim a professional diagnosis.\n\nIt's just, I guess, my OCD doesn't entail getting frustrated with the improper use of OCD!\nP0werPuppy: This is completely different to my examples, and is actual OCD. So I wonder, why are you fighting someone who is on your side. Really I'd think, like the other sufferers I have met, would be annoyed with the misuse of it. Also, you should have been referred to a mental health professional, so if I were you, I would go.\n[deleted]: Im not fighting you. I'm saying: it's OK for people to misuse words. Because it's impossible to *not* misuse words. If you'll forgive the... Triple negative? I have been referred, I was in hospital three times. Am on lithium and sertraline to deal with it.\n\nBut. I would say. There is no real thing as 'actual OCD'. It no more exists than 'love' exists. It is a poor facsimile, a placeholder word for a rich experience that *does* exist internally. \n\nWhat I detailed in my last post is closer to my lived experience than saying 'I have OCD' so I rarely say 'I have OCD'. But saying that long winded diatribe is also impractical, so for the most part, I don't even mention any of this. When someone says to me 'I have OCD' regardless of what they actually experience, I believe them. It could be that they really like their eggs done a certain way and that's the extent of their 'OCD'. That's fine. That's how they've chosen to define it and I can talk to them on their terms. It could be that if they don't turn the light switch on and off at least 100 times and don't end on an odd number they'll be unfit to go about their day. That requires more help to be sure and is certainly more in line with current medicine. \n\nIf they meet, the one who has 'OCD' about breakfast, and the one who is clinically ill with diagnosed OCD, I'm sure they will argue. But that's ok too. Becuase that is how we learn\nP0werPuppy: It's a placeholder for the huge variety of symptoms. That's why it should not be confused. OCD does exist. Liking your eggs a certain way isn't OCD, it's just a preference related to food.

I know it doesn't explicitly answer your question, but it should give you some idea of what the answer will be. \n\nFirst off, doing a OAPU at your weight is incredible. So incredible, it's actually kind of hard for me to believe. Although I want to believe this is true, simply because of how incredible it is.\n\nMay I ask how your form was? Straddle or straight legged?\n\nAs for your question, it depends on how many you're capable of doing. If you can only do 2 or 3, you'll have a hard time getting enough volume to make progress, so I would recommend scaling down a progression and working up to 8x3. But if you can do 4 or more, go for it. \nDancesWithDownvotes: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaabsolutely straddle.  Going down I turn  my shoulder down toward my hand, and push back straight coming up.\n\nSo, even though my muscles are dead tired in a similar way to other things I'd done more of, you think 5x3 isn't enough?  Not that I mean to sound like I'm arguing, I guess just being uneducated about these things I wonder what the difference is. \n\nI'll definitely try 8 sets of 3, but I wonder if my chest will hold up. lol\n[deleted]: My bad, I meant 3 sets of 8, on a lower progression.\n\n5 sets of 3 may work, try it and see how your body responds. Eventually you'll want to increase the reps of course. \n\nGood luck. \n\nOne more question, are you currently losing weight? Because I you are, by the time you get down into the 200lb range, you'll be extremely strong both proportionally and in general. \n\n\nDancesWithDownvotes: Doing keto, so it's making lifting a little harder since I'm not doing CKD or whichever it's called, if I can help it.  I've hit a plateau for the last 2 weeks for some reason.  Probably eating too much.  I go to town on baked chicken, man.\n\nHow long do you think some noticeable progress might take?  I know everybody's different, but exercises with the same muscle group I've seen results in 2-3 weeks before.  But these things are beastly, it's hard to see them getting easy any time soon.\n[deleted]: &gt;How long do you think some noticeable progress might take?\n\nThat depends on a lot of things. I can't give you a very accurate estimate without seeing you in person, but I'll do the best with what I've got.\n\nHow long have you been working out? How many times a week do you workout? What's your routine like? How are your sleeping habits? Do you drink/smoke? \nDancesWithDownvotes: I've been focusing chest for 3-4 months now, along with all the work that comes with living on a mountain, cutting down and moving trees, wood, heavy things, etc.  Lots of on the go.\n\nMy routine is optimized around achieving a 5x5, chest/triceps one day, biceps/shoulders the next.  Repeat.  If I get to doing 5x5 without failure I make it harder somehow, which is why I'm here today.\n\nNo drinking/smoking.  Sleep 6-8hrs a day.  \n[deleted]: Ok, given that routine, and the fact that you're still technically a beginner, you should progress relatively quickly.\n\n***But***\n\nYou're routine is imbalanced. This could lead to serious shoulder problems down the road. \n\nFor every pushing movement (e.g. Push-ups, dips) you do, you need a pulling movement (e.g. Pull-ups, rows) to balance it out. This will keep your shoulder from developing imbalances, which can seriously mess them up. Check out the FAQ in the sidebar for examples of exercises, and more info on routines. \nDancesWithDownvotes: I'd heard that about beginner gains, and I've been counting on it.  I've weighed this much for a long time, so maybe having to push ALL this weight around for so long will serve some benefit once I start losing more.\n\nThe whole idea was me noticing that I'd lost weight and how things were getting easier.  But since cancer and chemo, some switches have flipped in my head.  I don't WANT them to be easier, you know?  I feel like if I can keep things hard, I'll keep getting stronger and seeing progress.  I honestly enjoy the challenge...except jogging.  Screw running/jogging.  I hate it.  But it's a necessary pain I guess.\n\nI dunno if genetics help, but dad was a 5'7 ripped beast, and mom's tall and square...so maybe that helps.\n\nI've noticed lots of great things about my body, how it responds to what I give at it and throw at it, it's AMAZING to wake up one day recovered from something I put myself through before.  \n\nI wish I'd cared this much years ago.

{"full_text": "califmerchant: Do you agree that everything in the universe is predeterined and that the future can be predicted with nearly 100% accuracy if you know all relevant information\nHere's a short paper I wrote on the subject:\n\nhttp://sergebronstein.blogspot.com/2013/08/future-can-be-predicted-if-given-enough.html\nughaibu: We can construct arguments against determinism based on (at least) circularity, incommensurability, irreversibility, observation, randomness and regresses. On the other hand, there's no argument for determinism, other than, *if it were possible for a determined world to support life, like ourselves, and we were in such a world, then we could understand everything*, and even this wishful thinking fails, as a Laplacean demon must be external to and independent of the world.\nfrbnfr: What would those arguments be? The circularity argument for instance?\nughaibu: &gt;What would those arguments be? \n\nSurely you've at least heard regress arguments against determinism? \n\nAnyway, here's a simple argument adapted from Prigogine: \n\n1) a determined world is fully reversible \n\n2) life requires irreversibility \n\n3) therefore there is no life in a determined world \n\n4) in this world there is life \n\n5) therefore this world is not determined.\nBrian: &gt;1) a determined world is fully reversible \n\nI'm pretty sure this is false - there are trivial examples of deterministic systems that are irreversable - it simply requires a many-to-one relationship between input and output states, which doesn't rule out determinism at all.  Determinism requires exactly one successor state for every state, it says nothing about two states having the *same* successor state.  (Ie State A leads to State X, State B **also** leads to state X.  From state X we now have two possible prior states - with only state X we do not have enough information to reverse the process.).  Irreversbility means you can't determine the past from the future, not that the future can't be determined from the past.\n\nughaibu: &gt;&gt;1) a determined world is fully reversible\n\n&gt;I'm pretty sure this is false \n\nIt's pretty uncontroversial. Have a look at Price's [Time's Arrow](http://www.amazon.co.jp/Times-Arrow-Archimedes-Point-Directions/dp/0195117980) to see an example of how a determinist tries to persuade his reader that wave propagation, thermodynamic decay, etc, are reversible. \n\n\nBrian: I haven't read it, but \"A determinist thinks these properties are reversible\" != \"determinism implies reversibility\", and the latter claim is trivially false.  Conways Life, for instance, is an entirely deterministic cellular automata, but it is provably **not** reversible.\nughaibu: Perhaps you don't understand that *determinism* is a global claim. We're talking about determined worlds. Otherwise you could invent some game with \"deterministic\" rules and claim that determinism has whatever features your game utilises. In fact, isn't that what you just did, by proxy, with Conway's Life?\nBrian: &gt;Otherwise you could invent some game with \"deterministic\" rules and claim that determinism has whatever features your game utilises\n\nIf determinism implies property P, any determinsitic game **must** have property P, or it couldn't be deterministic.  A single counterexample of a deterministic system without P is sufficient to show that \"Determinism requires P\" is false.  \n\nI'm not making the claim that \"determinism has whatever features your game utilises\", which would imply **all** deterministic systems aren't reversible (indeed, this is false - there are both reversible and irreversable deterministic systems).  I'm saying that my game has whatever features determinsim requires - which it must because it *is* deterministic.\nughaibu: &gt;If determinism implies property P, any determinsitic game must have property P\n\nYou're equivocating. *Determinism* is a global thesis, whatever it is that you mean by a \"deterministic game\" is an independent notion.\nBrian: &gt;Determinism is a global thesis\n\nAnd?  It's the thesis that the universe acts by *deterministic rules*.  Ie. that given a state of the world, all future states can be generated.  Your contention is that this means that the universe is likewise reversable, but this is simply false, because this determinisitc property is *perfectly compatible* with irreversabiltiy.  The universe could be both deterministic and irreversable without conflict.\n\nto demonstrate this, I gave an example of another system that *does* have this deterministic property but **is** irreversable.  This is all that's required to show determinism doesn't imply reversabiltiy.  As such proving the irreversability of the universe wouldn't prove indeterminism one way or the other.\nughaibu: &gt; This is all that's required to show determinism doesn't imply reversabiltiy. \n\nIf you think that you've shown that a determined world needn't be reversible, then I guess you won't accept Prigogine's argument. Fair enough.\n", "prompt": "califmerchant: Do you agree that everything in the universe is predeterined and that the future can be predicted with nearly 100% accuracy if you know all relevant information\nHere's a short paper I wrote on the subject:\n\nhttp://sergebronstein.blogspot.com/2013/08/future-can-be-predicted-if-given-enough.html\nughaibu: We can construct arguments against determinism based on (at least) circularity, incommensurability, irreversibility, observation, randomness and regresses.

The circularity argument for instance?\nughaibu: &gt;What would those arguments be? \n\nSurely you've at least heard regress arguments against determinism? \n\nAnyway, here's a simple argument adapted from Prigogine: \n\n1) a determined world is fully reversible \n\n2) life requires irrevers", "generated": "It seems like there is a stark contrast between the views presented by these two individuals.

After all"}
{"full_text": "Wobulating: CMV: Communism is a fundamentally unworkable economic system\nTo start with, I am defining communism as an economic system where all property is publicly owned, and resources are given to citizens to fulfill their needs, as described by Marx.\n\nThis system, however, has a number of fundamental flaws that are inherent to it and cannot be escaped.\n\nIts largest problem, by far, is that it stifles innovation and growth. If your rewards are guaranteed, and are guaranteed to be equal, then there's very little motivation to work harder and innovate more, because there's no personal reward from it.\n\nTo provide an example, I'll use chickens and eggs. If you're a farmer with a chicken coop and you make enough eggs(let's say 100 a month as a totally arbitrary number) to fulfill your quotas, off of 20 hours a week of work. You *could* raise more chickens, maybe bump it up to 200 eggs, but why would you? You would need to build a bigger coop, spend more time caring for them, shovel more waste out and more food in, and it's just generally a lot more work. Maybe if you did double the number of chickens, you'd be fed up and you'd try to make an automatic chicken feeder, so it took less time for you, and maybe you'd even bump it up to 300 eggs with this new-fangled chicken feeder, but if you're on 100 eggs, there's just not much pressure. The entire point of communism is that whether you get 100 or 300 eggs, you are still rewarded about the same, so why put in the extra effort?\n\nThere are, of course, proposed solutions, often quotas- but those have a very poor track record, for the simple reason that setting quotas is *really hard*. Set them too high, and your citizens can't reach them and they hate you, and set them too low, and just don't get very much stuff done, and figuring out how much is too high or too low is really, really difficult. There's a million factors that go into determining the maximum amount that a person can reasonably produce, and such a top-heavy approach simply cannot account for them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo step higher up, planned economies like this(and communism does demand a planned economy) have *really* bad track records. Markets and environments change dramatically and quickly, and it's very hard for top-heavy economies to respond well to those sorts of changing circumstances. It's very hard for people to respond to change, generally, especially if there's no personal stake. If the central planner goes home at the end of the day no matter what, then they probably aren't gonna get super invested in whether or not all the stuff that they're responsible for is performing optimally. \n\nAdditionally, they're simply much worse at creating that innovation that drives the world forward- as outlined, they decrease personal desire to innovate, but even for the people who *do* want to make something new, it's much more difficult. Creating something new and exciting is, at the end of the day, going to take resources and time, and if you have to petition a bureaucrat a hundred miles away to let you do this, that's a huge barrier to entry.\nPreacherJudge: &gt; Its largest problem, by far, is that it stifles innovation and growth. If your rewards are guaranteed, and are guaranteed to be equal, then there's very little motivation to work harder and innovate more, because there's no personal reward from it.\n\nPeople innovate and work hard all the time without getting lots of money from it.  This is just knee-jerk cynicism, assuming that the only thing that'll motivate people is personal, financial gain.\ncape_of_good_hope: I just assume that anyone who has that argument has never been deeply involved in fandom. The lengths that people will go to create things for free for the media they love is limitless.\npearoad: Passion alone does not drive human society.\n\nThere are thousands upon thousands of people who are passionate about star wars for example, but less people will be passionate about, say, trains.\n\nEven though trains are a vital part of modern human transport, one of the most economically efficient and depending on the distance, fast enough to compete with trucking or flying the goods; just because they don't zip around in space shooting lasers people will be less interested in them.\n\nImagine a world where your train systems are failing and yet there are 70 different star wars fan films coming out each year. Let me emphasize my point. Passion alone does not drive human society.\n\nIn fact, I'd argue the stuff that the lesser people are passionate about are the real deal. Train is a relatively easier example, and there are more messy things that are vital for the human society. Say, garbage disposal system. Say, sewers system literally handling people's s\\*\\*t.\n\nThe current world works because you pay people do to stuff they don't want to do. If they don't want to do it, pay them more and see if they will do it!\n\nI know this is glorifying capitalism, and that it doesn't always work this way - some greedy ass will try to steal the valuable hard work somewhere along the line, by not paying enough etc., but this is how capitalism works in essence.\n\nWhereas communism has no real way of compensating people for doing something that everybody don't want to do.\n\nI will put it simple : If you can get enough people to be passionate about shoveling literal s\\*\\*t without any tangible compensation, that's when I will consider communism.\nThe_Last_Minority: If you think people aren't passionate about infrastructure, and ESPECIALLY trains, then I suggest googling forums and social media groups about them. I know people who can declaim passionately on the different models of high-speed engine rolled out in Japan or Europe, and who send pictures when they see an unusual model in the station. If rail and infrastructure education and development was opened, you wouldn't be able to keep people away.\n\nAlso, from where comes the idea that nobody cares about sanitation? Obviously it isn't the most appealing job, but there are still people who like doing it. Besides, it needs to happen and people recognize that. Under community control, a number of models exist. One would be rotating, where multiple people put in a bit of time, and another could be some form of community incentive, where the people who help clean the most get a shout-out or their name on a plaque each month. Not all incentive has to be financial. \n\nBest model, imo, is a combination of rotating responsibility and restructuring how we handle waste. Currently Americans are highly inefficient with waste disposal, something that makes the job of waste collection much less pleasant. Look at Japan for a good counter-example. If everyone knows they or someone they know will take a turn doing community service, there is kore incentive to keep waste to a minimum and not make it gross.\n\nCommunism doesn't mean everything will suddenly be perfect. However, removing profit motive and the stigma around certain jobs absolutely means fewer people will take issue with it.\npearoad: Dude, my point is, its not that NOBODY cares, its that not ENOUGH people will be interested in a lot of the jobs without the monetary compensation that enables them to do other things.\n\nAnd community incentives? This is honestly such a naive thought. Do you really think enough people will naturally be inclined to shovel your s\\*\\*t because you tell nice things to them?\n\nLet me tell you what, if i gave you enough compliments and some plaque on a wall a month, would YOU be willing to shovel my s\\*\\*t? You can't just randomly imagine that there must be \"some other guy\" who's willing to do this.\n\nI am sorry, but I'd rather have a single piece of tangible bread(and more) for my family than some compliment if i had to work those jobs.\n\nCapitalism is a system that relies on the \"perceived value\" of things, including labor and goods. Even animals - insects! engage in trade! I am baffled as to how people are failing to grasp this.\n\nIt isn't capitalism stopping you from chasing your passion, it is just the real world stopping you from doing it. The fact is, the real world doesn't have enough of these \"good passion jobs\", where grueling manufacturing jobs \"where you have to repeat the same mundane thing for the next 12 hours jobs\" are in abundance.\n\nAnd don't get me started \"we must go back to simpler way of life with less wastes\" bs. Just so you know, economy of scale is a very real thing. We as a society benefit more as a whole by having a centralized system of sorts.\n\nIf you are in denial, please, let me know if you can singlehandedly build the smartphone or the pc from ground up, whatever it is that you are using to browse internet rn. It just doesn't happen.\n\nCapitalism sucks, I agree.\n\nBut its simply the only way things work. Can we work on it so that people are actually treated more fairly, with appropriate wages? Hell yeah, we should!\n\nBut communism never works. So many countries tried, So many countries failed. Its funny how they always say \"oh, all the countries that failed didn't practice &lt;true communism&gt;.\"\n\nwhatever the f\\*\\*k that means. I honestly think this is because the baseline philosophy is flawed, which is why it always directs itself towards dictatorship and overly controlling governments with only the few elites enjoying the fruit.\n\nOh, the irony.\nEyesofmalice: If you go country by country,capitalism has failed way more times that communism has. Besides, a good incentive for working in sanitation would be benefits such as extended vacations, earlier retirement and so on.  \n\nBesides, in a capitalist economy infrastructure jobs can only get access to more advanced technology for fulfilling a task if the market deems it profitable. In a communist economy we'd probably task engineers and scientists to work on optimizing waste disposal and infrastructure in order to make them sustainable and efficient. I mean that's a current environmental concern that can't be addressed because the market is just not willing to invest that much in it. With communal central control the people who point at those problems would have the backing of the state and the resources to find solutions for them.\npearoad: Proportionally, all the countries that has proclaimed communism has 1. Either failed, 2. Is failing, 3. Or is only pretending to be a communist to protect a dictatorship regime, e.g. China.\n\nThere were hundreds, there\u2019s what, Cuba left?\n\nAll the other thrieving countries are worked on by capitalism. Yeah it failed a lot of countries, but so far it has been the only known way that has the potential to work.\n\nYour second paragraph is exactly why communism fails so hard and is especially prone to a fascist government. Seriously, look at it.\n\nGovernment will tell you exactly what you do, decide exactly what you do even if the market doesn\u2019t accomodate it. Sounds familiar? Its literally just one step away!\n\nI am all for worker\u2019s benefits and universal government programs supporting basic human needs, but damn, the reality is, it works in capitalism better than communism ever has.\nEyesofmalice: You thinking that successful communist countries are only pretending to be so while being capitalists instead is just allowing your capitalist paranoia to run off. \n\nBeing one step away means very little when as many fascist governments have been capitalistic. Fascism has risen in various economic systems. So it's again judging communism for stuff that also has happened and continues to happen under capitalism.\npearoad: You can\u2019t seriously believe China is a successful communist country. Successful? Yes. Communist? No.\n\nDude, have you seen how their workers live? Its literally one of the worst ways capitalism manifested itself.\n\nThey\u2019ve only just ruled LAST MONTH that 996 (9am to 9pm, six days a week) work culture to be illegal! That is 72 hours a week! Most successful capitalistic countries work 40 hours a week.\nEyesofmalice: Successful capitalistic countries are allowed that luxury by working others in other countries to death. You have to be cynical to think that your first world goods aren't being produced by children in less developed countries.\n\nBesides the Chinese government owns most of the land in china and only loans it if it's going to be used for productive purposes,which to me sounds like the state owns a crucial mean of producing land. They also have country wide welfare housing and services, and they routinely seize industries as well as regular them tightly. I'd love to hear what is it about china that is capitalistic in your eyes. \n\nBesides your point is so convoluted. So china is not communistic because their workers rights are non existent. So are you implying that capitalism demands workers exploitation?\n\nAdditionally, it's not uncommon in capitalist countries for people to need to work two jobs in order to make ends meet.and I'm not even talking about proletarians but also members of the middle class.\npearoad: Yes, China's workers' rights are non existent. Meanwhile capitalistic countries exercise workers' rights and have, like I mentioned, enjoys 40 hour weeks. Do you seriously not see the irony here?\n\nCombined with much higher minimum wage, workers in successful capitalist countries in effect, live much more humane life. So like i said, workers' rights seems to be much more well protected in capitalistic countries.\n\nThe very core of communism is being done better by capitalism!\n\nDo you seriously not see how flawed the whole idea is?\n\nAlso, Chinese government owns most of the land, yes. But their welfare housing is a joke. Look up \"Beijing underground apartments\", and maybe you should check out how their proletariats live. It never ceases to amaze me how they haven't revolted yet.\n\nPlus, although they own the land, because they are loaned off to private companies, the means of production STILL belongs in the private sector. How is that communism, when the fruits of production goes straight to the hands of the bourgeoisie?\n\nSo basically denying their very core principles of the communism by non existent workers' rights, while not even providing the necessary housing, while giving all the fruits to the bourgeoisie?\n\nTrust me, you'd rather want to believe China is a capitalist country, if you seriously  love communism. Either way, I honestly don't care though, since China only shows how dystopian capitalistic societies can be.\n\nSo claim China communists all you want, I guess.\nEyesofmalice: So if chine is so capitalistic and terrible, wouldn't that prove that capitalistic tendencies tend to oversee human rights? \n\n\nAnd again,  capitalist countries rely on exploiting foreign workers, so you can't just analyze the workers right on one piece of land without taking into account the conditions created overseas for those \"workers privileges\". \n\n\nBesides, almost no capitalist country has been so without brutal exploitation of other territories. So it's in very bad faith to say that the success of these supposed capitalistic paradises doesn't come at the cost of the inhumane exploitation of foreign workers.\n\nIt isn't communism, it's socialism, they're getting there though. At least the state can rent the private sector plus tax them.  \n\nAlso, underground apartments are way mor humane than the roaring levels of homelessness we have in capitalistic countries. We have to analyze china in context, and in context china is doing better than about 80% of all capitalistic countries.\n\nYou're taking the best examples of capitalism while avoiding any of their colonialist tendencies and also brushing under the rug all capitalistic countries which have incredibly high levels of corruption, homelessness, starvation and. Unemployment. Metrics that, under the rule of the Chinese communist party decreased dramatically. \n\nBut fine, since you have such a hate boner against china and since it's also making your point so convoluted, take Cuba then. They have a better standard of living than most of south America , even with the embargo in action, they report higher quality of education and also lower levels of malnutrition and homelessness than other latina merca countries which are routinely torn and exploited by america and Europe for the benefit of enterprises.\npearoad: Omg, let me try to sum it up:\n\n1. Either china is capitalist and sucks in workers rights, or is a \u201csuccessful\u201d communist and sucks in workers right.\n\n2-1. There are other capitalist countries who have it a lot better than chinese protariats - and like i noted, it seems like protariats do better in capitalist countries than in communism.\n\n2-2. This is the core value of communism, and if this is done better by capitalist, you seriously have to wonder if the idealogy is actually legit\n\n3. I brought up china in a passing by note saying how i think China is more capitalistic, and it was you who wanted to expand more into that realm.\n\n4-1. Nobody forced these less developed countries to do, what you\u2019d call, \u201cslave labor\u201d or \u201ccapitalistic colonialism\u201d. They can always refuse, do whatever the hell they want. This the very nature of capitalism - people are free to choose what they do.\n\n4-2. However, everyone wants foreign investment and always welcomes them with open arms, including China. This is because, in a lot of scenarios, it is a win-win situation. Economics isn\u2019t a zero-sum game.\n\n5. Maybe you should stop calling people convoluted, when it is definitely you who likes to bring in multiple points at the same time, hence me needing to be this bulletin point form.\n\n6. The forementioned issues of China was introduced as a result of CCP rule to begin with. Corruption and starvation especially. This was solved by, ironically, introducing more capitalistic values.\n\n7. China isn\u2019t doing better than 80% of all capitalistic countries. They rank 85 at HDI, 2019. This is barely above 55%. Below are mostly african countries, which ironically, a lot of them former communist nations.\n\nDude honestly i don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019ve spent way too much time forming up these arguements and i am not willing to spend more time.\n\nSo goodbye\nEyesofmalice: 2.1 again, China only sucks at workers rights in comparison to certain countries which still force other people in other countries to work till they drop or starve to death jobless.\n\n2.2 downright refuse your claim that workers rights are better under capitalist countries. We have insanely high rates of unemployment, unsormountable student debt, economic crises every seven or eight years, mass layoff regularly. Even in my country, the average person has less access to food and services than people in Cuba,even though our territory has more natural resources than Cuba, but obviously they're all owned by foreign enterprises that have funded armed groups and seized ownership of our resources.\n\n3. That increase in life quality by other capitalist countries didn't come out of nowhere, it was caused by rampant colonialism.\n\n4. You can either work for pennies or we'll bomb you. You're free to choose. Such great freedom. It's just such bullshit claim tbh. It's like, look at cuba.are you also gonna say that no one is forcing Cuba to turn into a capitalist state? Or Afghanistan? Or Syria? Even Colombia, my own country. It's so suspicious that it seems that enterprises from Europe and the states are always involved in the funding of armed groups and policy change.\n\n4.1\" everyone wants foreign investment\" it's too broad of a description, everyone wants a specific type of foreign investment, not the type that sucks the resources out of your country and then leaves useless infrastructure in place.\n\n5. I said your point was convoluted, not you. You're not your points. You thinking that your self is your arguments is kinda... Weird I guess.\n\n6. Hdi is super contested though. My own country ranks higher than china and yet chine has lower rates of child mortality, higher quality of education, higher index of industrial development and production. So I'd very very wary to put as much weight as you seem to on that index tbh.\npearoad: Ok. I think our differences lie on personal experience afterall.\n\nFor context, I am S. Korean and I've seen what capitalism can achieve. After the Korean war, for my grandparents it was luxurious to have meat on table at all. Today, a spoilt brat of me will not have a table without meat.\n\nMeanwhile, N. Korea, with the very same culture and history, are still starving to this day with a strong fascist of a government - or even an authoritarian monarchy.\n\nThe difference is so big, that even with having the same genetics, their average height is at least 20cm (or more) lower than S. Korea's. Meanwhile, the average male height of S. Korea in 20s stand around 175cm, tallest of any Asian nation and on par with European &amp; N. American nations. This is only after 3 generations of capitalism.\n\nI've myself seen first hand, how my hometown became so developed from a s\\*\\*tty rural town to what we have today. They were selling dog meat on the market, it was their thing up until 20 years ago. My whole block wasn't here 20 years ago, and 2 whole cities immediately next to us. (there are building 2 more as we speak).\n\nOur companies such as Samsung, LG have global presence and we don't bomb people when they don't want us. We don't care, we will find another bunch who'd welcome us.\n\nCuba's case sucks for them and yeah I'd love to see the sanctions to be lifted too, for humanitarian reasons, but history tells us that it was the Cubans who forcifully annexed US citizen owned property there during the communist revolution, so I also understand why US is so pissy about this.\n\nMeanwhile, My dad owned a business in China. He sold it, but this is why I understand how things are in CN. I've been there multiple times, and seen how people live, firsthand.\n\nI've had coworkers who are ethnic Korean Chinese, giving me explicit detail about how things are so different. We have so much of our own problems. young people aren't getting married anymore, not having kids, aging population etc., but they'd rather come and live here instead. They also face hideous discrimination, but since our government legally proclaims them to be our citizen, they CAN come here and they DO.\n\nBare in mind, this is a nation that started from ashes, we were poorer than most african nations in 1950s, let alone China or North Korea.\n\nI don't deny that capitalism CAN suck too. In fact, I'd argue that It DOES suck. But at least for ME, I've seen how much communism sucks so much MORE.\n\nMaybe for you, your experiences might be different and it might shape you differently. But that is MY experience. I think we just have to agree to disagree, seriously, because we are going nowhere with this discussion.\n\nHave a good day.\nalhanathalas: North Korea is not a communist nation, there is no state in communism. Your country has had extensive funding from the west. I'm from Turkey and i can tell you a very different story.\npearoad: lol ofc NK isn\u2019t communist. To the \u201cfundamentalism communists\u201d apparently there was no \u201ctrue\u201d communist state. Maybe because it isn\u2019t possible at all to have a \u201ctrue communist state\u201d.\n\nAnd no, communists are allowed to have a state, in fact, communism is defined as \u201cstate owning the means of production\u201d. What you are describing is anarcho-communism, which is a vastly different concept.\n\nYes SK was funded massively by the West, but so was many other countries. Did all of them succeed? No, very few succeeded, if at all but KR. \n\nDoes this mean capitalism isn\u2019t as good as people preach? Yes, absolutely. But let me repeat, communism has NEVER EVER worked as good as capitalistic states have. This is a given fact with no disputes.\n\nJust please don\u2019t necro a dead thread again.\n\nI am done talking about this.\nalhanathalas: you don't know ANYTHING about socialism and communism i'm not blaming you for wanting to shut up. better stay that way lumpen cunt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withering\\_away\\_of\\_the\\_state\npearoad: You don\u2019t even know the difference between anarcho communism and just communism, and have the audacity to say it is \u201cI\u201d who doesn\u2019t know anything.\n\nWow. You deserve some slow claps.\nalhanathalas: lmao literally unaware of what he is talking about. go read some theory, you are wrong.\npearoad: Marx was obviously wrong about \u201cwithering away of the state\u201d, most communist states ended up with extreme authority governing over the people.\n\nChina, NK, Soviet Union for example. Or they literally \u201cwithered away\u201d and no longer exist.\n\nMarx\u2019s idealistic theory is literally some 150 years ago. People were fighting on horseback, black/women\u2019s rights were long way to come, religious states were still a thing.\n\nTurkey was under the Ottomans rule! How do you not see how obsolete the idea is? People tried and failed, its as simple as that.\nalhanathalas: &gt;Marx was obviously wrong about \u201cwithering away of the state\u201d, most communist states ended up with extreme authority governing over the people.\n\nMarx? Who said anything about Marx? Stop making a joke of yourself already. This is emberassing really, repeating your anti-communist school curriculum bulllcrap.\n\n&gt;China, NK, Soviet Union for example. Or they literally \u201cwithered away\u201d and no longer exist.\r\n\nBecause they are not COMMUNIST COUNTRIES. THEY ARE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE BASICS OF POLITICAL THEORIES OF COMMUNISM YET YOU DARE TO TALK ABOUT IT. \n\n&gt;Marx\u2019s idealistic theory is literally some 150 years ago. People were fighting on horseback, black/women\u2019s rights were long way to come, religious states were still a thing.\r  \n\r\n\nThe fuck is an idealistic theory? The fuck are you even talking about? 150 years? Black rights? What the fuck are you even talking about, you think there were black people in Germany in 1800s? XD. Holy shit i've heard a lot of criticism about communism but it being \"old\" is new. You know... Capitalism and Free markets are older than Marx right? You also know Communism is not theorized by Marx and it's been around some time before Marx? Like, the fuck are you talking about? How old are you? You cannot be older than 18 or something, your mind seems to be filled up with trash. Free it up. I'm not even going to start talking about religious states. You clearly haven't read Das Kapital. \n\n&gt;Turkey was under the Ottomans rule! How do you not see how obsolete the idea is? People tried and failed, its as simple as that.\r  \n\r\n\nTurkey was not under Ottoman's rule. Turkish Republic didn't exist before 1923. Obsolete idea? Ottomans are an obsolote idea? Sure. Your country is in shambles, you have no young, you have BY FAR the lowest fertility rate in the world. It's going down because your Captalist system created such a malicious enviroment for children and adults people don't want to have children anymore. You are fucked and capitalism is the reason.\npearoad: lol, here we go again. Ofc they weren't communists, why else would have failed? /s. Socialistic states are countries closer to Scandinavian countries, which is proven to WORK. Communism NEVER has in large scale.\n\nChina for example, as it is moving away from communism into socialist (which is why it grew so much in  the first place), but for example they still have laws based off communistic laws, the government owns the land and corporate leases them for example.\n\nYeah, capitalism is some old idea, but it is being worked on and new ideas are being built on top of it. Like the theory of evolution isn't new, but like how the modern version of it is vastly different than what Darwin originally suggested.\n\nOn capitalism, people research through different economic blocks, and are constantly trying to learn something new(because frankly, it makes money!).\n\nCan you say the same about communism? All people do is look at some tribal communities or small willful groups in that scale and think \"wow, this might work.\". This is honestly delusional, we don't even have a full scale model to work with.\n\nI am mostly a centrist liberal, and communistic ideals fail to convince even me. How are you going to convince far rights and the rich and the powerful who are much more adamant on the issue?\n\nThe fact is, you just can't. You have to force them (this is what Marx suggested), destroy and subjugate. Then you put militaristic power on the state, and once they are in power, they will refuse to come down, lol.\n\nHumans just be like that.\n\nRegarding the Ottomans comment, I meant the land that currently makes up Turkey, not Republic of Turkey under Ottomans rule. I admit i fucked that one up, I could have worded it better.\n\nand finally, yes my country is in shambles, yes its capitalism that's at fault, but we wouldn't even have been here with communistic ideals. Instead,  we'd be starving our asses and getting murdered in the streets for verbally dissing the all-mighty-figure, like North Korea.\nalhanathalas: Okay i'm not arguing about politics with a 17 year old. Bye.\npearoad: Dude, look. \n\nThe original guy i talked this over, we had different views. But still we tried to talk things over, and agreed that we aren't going nowhere when we realized our views were way to different to agree something on.

We get along, talk about all kinds of topics, support each other, our personalities are quite similar, and we usually bond over cats. But the other day we kind of had an issue.\n\nWe were texting and he told me he had just shaved, so we started talking about shaving.

So he asked me if I shave \u201cdown there\u201d.\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, we get along and talk about all kinds of topics, we\u2019ve talked about sexuality before (but in a more general way) and it\u2019s totally fine by me, but I personally don\u2019t like talking about that private stuff. So I laughed and sent a thinking emoji. A couple minutes later, he asked if I was embarrassed, and I said that I just don\u2019t really like talking about that stuff. He asked if I was scared, and said that he likes being open with me. I said I like being open with him as well.\n\nHe sent a smiley emoji, so I thought everything was fine.

As you already extend One Leg it creates the illusion that you are really close the to full progression even though that is actually not the case. Usually, when someone is talking about the One Leg Progression they mean that you extend the other leg just like in an Advance Tuck Position, which on the other hand is actually really hard and much closer to the full progression. The reason for that if I am not wrong is that when you tuck one leg in you are actually rounding your back just like in the normal tuck variation and hence create an overall shorter lever and making the exercise easier. That and the fact the the exercise gets obviously harder as you keep on extending the other leg. I am not sure on which progression you currently are but you might as well try both next time and see the difference for yourself.

One of your close friends is literally married and you dont even know his wife? \n\nSo, one of the ideas that seems most likely to me is that OP is simply from a country where that is the cultural norm.

{"full_text": "figa_53: Opinions on calisthenics + running routine\nHi everyone! \n\nI'm a very busy person (10+ hours of work a day, 2 kids, living far from my hometown) and i'm trying to stick to a routine that is sustainable and that provide me some hypertrophy in the long run.\nSince i'm a military, I need to run at least 3 times a week just to maintain my conditioning for the army fitness requirements of my country (which, for running, means being able to run 1,8 mile/2900 meter in 12 minutes). \n\nMy stats today:\nHeight: 1,72 m / 5,64 feet\nActual weight: 72 kg / 158 lbs\nAge: 29\n\n\nMy fitness/gym experience:\n- Sedentary kid. \n- Joined a gym when was 16 years. At that time, weight went from 58 kg to 62 kg. Flexed arm 32cm. \n- Joined the Military Academy at 17. Quit gym for obvious reasons. For the following 5 years of my life, just survived the Academy (lots of running, calisthenics, field exercises, poor sleep, etc). At the end, my stats were something like: 66kg, flexed arm 33cm, age 21 (year was 2013). \n- For the next 6 years, just maintained the military fitness routine (some running... some calisthenics). Normal diet (3 meals a day, mostly healthy food, some beer at weekends). In october 2019, my stats were almost the same of the previous: 65kg, flexed arm 32cm, age 27.\n- In november 2019, decided to try something to bulk up. Stopped running and begun Starting Strength routine. Diet was normal added with a \"half GOMAD\". Maintained this for 2 months. The results were: Squat went from 40kg to 110kg; bench press went from 50kg to 72kg; overhead press from 16kg to 42kg; deadlift from 50kg to 120kg. Stats at the end: 75kg, flexed arm 35 cm, age 28. HOWEVER, the bad side was: run conditioning went to shit, and the parts of my body that grow the most were my legs, butt and belly! Didnt enjoy my appearence at the end, so I stopped Starting Strength in february 2020.\n- Did nothing (no running, no weights, no calisthenics) from feb to july 2020, because of the pandemic 1st wave. Stats at the end: 67 kg, flexed arm 33cm, age 28.\n- In august 2020, decided to try to bulk up again. This time, with a totally diferent approach: I did the 6 days a week Schwarzenegger Beginner routine. Took creatine and tracked my calories. Didnt run during this time. It *did* work! I was able to maintain that routine till the end of october 2020. Stats at the end: 74kg, flexed arm 38cm. Bad sides: the workouts took too much time (between 1h30 to 2h). For a busy person like me, wasnt sustainable in the long run. Other than that, i wasnt able to run during that time, for 2 reasons: lack of time and lack of energy. \n- From october 2020 to actual days, I did some eventual running and calisthenics. Stats today: 72kg, flexed arm 37cm, age 29. \n\nSo, now I want to try to do something that:\n- Allow me to run the mininum needed to maintain the army fitness requirement (which i think means running at least 3 times a week). \n- Dont take a lot of time. 30 minutes should be the best, but 45 can do.\n- Allow me to get some hypertrophy in the long run.\n- Dont need a gym (gym means time lost going to and from the gym). \n\nAfter some reading (recommended routine reddit, bodyweight muscle book, greyskull lp book, the prio system, etc) I came to the following routine: \n\n1ST WEEK:\nMonday:\n- Chin Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- Push Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- BW squat progression 3x(6-30) \n\nTuesday:\nRunning (5-8 km / pace: 4:45min/km) \n\nWednesday:\n- Front Lever row progression 3x(6-30)\n- Pike Push Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- Hinge progression 3x(6-30) \n\nThursday:\n- HIIT run = (8-12)x400m, 1:30/lap, 1:30/rest \n\nFriday\n- Chin Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- Push Up progression 3x(6-30)\n- BW squat progression 3x(6-30) \n\nSaturday:\n- Running (5-8 km / pace: 4:45min/km) \n\nSunday:\n- Rest \n\n2ND WEEK:\n- Keep the running routine. \n- Alternate the calisthenics workouts. \n\nSome detail:\n- Rest between sets is 2 minutes. \n- After building enough strength and coordination, the idea is going from pike to handstand push ups. \n- I took the rep range from The Prio System book. The author says, at some point, that there are scientific data showing this rep range (6-30) works for hypertrophy. \n- Yes, the strenght routine is like a calisthenic version of Phraks Greyskull LP. \n\nSo, what do you think about this workout? Can I expect some muscle gain in the long run?\nkickflip10_: Two thoughts on this.\n\n6-30 is an enormous rep range. It's not the hypertrophy range. The hypertrophy range is individual to you and is likely to be most prominent with a couple of reps of somewhere in the 6-30 range. For example, one person might see gains around the 6 rep mark. Someone else might see more gains around 10, someone else at 12, 15, 20, so on. You're not necessarily rewarded all the way up to 30 reps. You're just flogging a dead horse. Find the hypertrophy range that works for you and when you can own/ surpass it, decide if you want to build up some muscular endurance and go a bit higher, or add resistance and build back up to the rep range that works for you.\n\nYour running requirement is 2.9km in 12 minutes, so why are you running 5-8km? Unless you specifically want to get better at middle distance running, focus on your 12 minutes. Your HIIT run is a good example. If I was training for 2.9km in 12 minutes, I'd go for 1:1 intervals in the 4-800m range, MAS training, and 12-15 minute 'runs' for comfort/ conditioning. (I also have a military background but different requirements).\nfiga_53: About the running training: I'm just following the Army \"recommended\" running training. Here are screens taken directly from Army Physical Training Field Manual:\n\n- HIIT running training:\nhttps://imgur.com/KEiEy46\n\n- Continuous running training:\nhttps://imgur.com/Qb3LE7e\nhttps://imgur.com/UqhKhNA\nfiga_53: It's in portuguese, but i think it's understandable...\nkickflip10_: Not saying it's wrong, just saying it's not the most efficient way to train for that assessment. If you enjoy running those distances then go for it.\nfiga_53: The problem is that i dont really like running that much, because the more i run, the more i lose time, energy and recovery. I'm doing that protocol just because its the army's recommendation. But I really would like to stick to a running routine that took less time/energy and that provide the minimum conditioning my job need.\nkickflip10_: Easiest I can recommend is 4-6 sets of 1:1, whatever distance makes up roughly what you need. If you need 2.9km, go for 4 x 700, 5 x 600, maybe 5/6 x 500. And just once-twice a week. I think that will help your assessment more than running 5km.\nfiga_53: How much time per lap? If I keep the pace of the army hiit training, a 600m lap should be done in something like 2:15.\nkickflip10_: Aim for a time that is as fast as sustainable for all laps. If 'race pace' is 2:15, but you're resting 1:1, then obviously you can go faster. Try 2:00 and see if you can maintain 5 x 600 @ 2:00 1:1. Adjust a few seconds either way if it's too hard or too easy. Once you find a time that works, don't change it every week. Lock it in for a few weeks, and then change the workout to a different distance (longer or shorter) and repeat the process.\n", "prompt": "figa_53: Opinions on calisthenics + running routine\nHi everyone! \n\nI'm a very busy person (10+ hours of work a day, 2 kids, living far from my hometown) and i'm trying to stick to a routine that is sustainable and that provide me some hypertrophy in the long run.\nSince i'm a military, I need to run at least 3 times a week just to maintain my conditioning for the army fitness requirements of my country (which, for running, means being able to run 1,8 mile/2900 meter in 12 minutes). \n\nMy stats today", "orig": ":\nHeight: 1,72 m / 5,64 feet\nActual weight: 72 kg / 158 lbs\nAge: 29\n\n\nMy fitness/gym experience:\n- Sedentary kid. \n- Joined a gym when was 16 years.

In terms of trust from the customer this is really backwards, \u00e0 seller has to build hundreds or even thousands of reviews for their products to be visible and trusted, and \u00e0 single counterfeit manufacturer can easily slip in and take advantage of that visibility for free, it's really dumb. \n\nThe brands surely should be against this as it can severely damage the image of their products if you see \"ORIGINAL Insert brand ITEM\", paying full price and you think you got shafted by the brand in the end.\nfazalmajid: Amazon has the gall to turn their own lack of diligence in policing their market into a profit center, and making the brands pay to weed out counterfeits from their store:\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18244603/amazon-project-zero-counterfeit-listing-remove-products\n\nRead this article for the Kafkaesque nature of Amazon's processes for honest sellers who have been tarred by association with counterfeit goods due to commingling:\n\nhttps://blog.dshr.org/2019/04/what-is-amazon.html\n\nand this one explains why Amazon is rife with counterfeits (Apple says *90% of its accessories sold on Amazon are fakes*):\n\nhttps://www.elevationlab.com/blogs/news/amazon-is-complicit-with-counterfeit-sellers\nfarahad: Makes sense.  People pay a premium for real products, and if a high enough percentage of buyers keep their knockoffs because they don't know any better, that's added profit.  That's great for the unethical sellers, but I don't see Amazon's angle.  If Amazon's collecting the same fees for the knockoffs, their only advantage is...cheaper shipping / logistics, because the knockoff suppliers are potentially closer to some customers?  If that's the case, they're being *very* shortsighted, because this is the kind of thing that will result in their losing repeat customers and product share.  Once they get the reputation of selling cheap knockoffs, people will start looking elsewhere.  Same thing happened to eBay and most other unvetted forums.  People don't want to have to scrutinize their purchases.\nfazalmajid: I agree the reputational damage outweighs the gains for them. Amazon's marketplace platform makes significantly more money than Amazon's own e-commerce operations, and AWS, Amazon's platform business, accounts for 2/3 of the value of the company (and indeed AWS' CEO Andy Jassy is Bezos' successor), so that's how they view themselves now.  Amazon prides itself on being customer-centric, but in this case the customer is the third-party seller, not the end-user, we are the product, despite spending money.\n\nI stopped buying electronics from Amazon a long time ago and only get them from B&amp;H Photo, Adorama or direct from the manufacturer. My Amazon spending has collapsed by a factor of 6x over its peak in 2011:\n\nhttps://blog.majid.info/slow-decline-of-amazon-prime/\nizzittho: As someone who works with a seller....nah, they\u2019re still much better to the customer in comparison to how they treat sellers. I reckon they only really want the pool of sellers so they can gather data on what sells and what\u2019s searched for. \n\nThey have a nice little setup where they let others take the risks first and then pounce on anything doing well and edge others out. Think about how much insight you end up getting if you\u2019re in their shoes - you get searches, sales figures, often literally a list of people\u2019s suppliers, if you get items taken down due to counterfeit accusations (happens all the time, but funnily enough never to real counterfeits) and need to provide their info as proof to get reinstated.\n\nThey can potentially know your costs too. They have all this valuable data they can probably sell to someone, and can use it to know exactly what to sell themselves and how to get it. The fact that they\u2019re guaranteed to have more money than you to work with and don\u2019t need to do any guesswork to determine what will sell means you\u2019re guaranteed to eventually get undercut by them if you\u2019ve enjoyed too much success. They\u2019re in competition with you using the data you provide them against you.\n\nThe trick is that even the marketplace is all about the data they can gather. Data\u2019s the name of their whole game, regardless of how they use it. The kowtowing to customers builds loyalty that they can eventually maintain without it, so they\u2019ll gradually decrease benefits, and of course pursuing dishonest sellers and fakes isn\u2019t really worth the effort to them if they can get sellers themselves to do the legwork, so they leave it up to them with little to no help.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the whole more or less stealing FBA shipments to sell on their deal site fiasco.

I am doing this for friends in business \n\n[How the Oscars proved Hollywood is killing the VFX industry](http://io9.com/5987131/why-the-visual-effects-industry-protested-the-oscars-and-how-the-academy-insulted-them-in-return)\n\n[Hollywood visual effects producers fight their industry's migration to China](http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/02/27/hollywood-visual-effects-producers-fight-their-industry-migration-to-china/#ixzz2M8E0UbUL)\n\n[Visual Effects Society Calls For New California Tax Incentives](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/visual-effects-society-calls-new-424791)\n\n\nOzzimo: Without being a dick here, it's been mentioned that the VFX company got exactly what they were contracted to be payed. It's not like the Life of Pi guys held back checks or anything. If they went out of business doing the work then the blame has to be placed on the business managers of the VFX company. I work at a small Web Design company and we simply don't do work for free. If the client wants changes made they made fully aware that it will cost them this much money. \n\nI feel bad that they went out of business but this protest feels misplaced.\nShanksterr: The movie studio low balled the VFX studio. The common practice of movie studios is \"well if you can't do it, we'll get another studio to do it cheaper\". At the end of the day no matter who does the effects, the same quality of work is expected from the studio. So R+H did it because work is better than no work at all. All studios do this. Time frames and budgets get cut but VFX is expected to turn around each shot with inadequate compensation. \nOzzimo: I'm fully aware but it's not the fault of the studio for getting a deal. Also there is a difference between getting a bad deal and getting a terrible deal that puts you out of business.\nShanksterr: It's not so much their fault for getting a deal. It's their fault for demanding that the VFX studio make this movie for less then what they should be paid. Meanwhile they rake in the cash while the studio that essentially made the movie what it was went bankrupt. The industry as a whole takes advantage of the situation and exploits it. VXF artists are making this issue aware so we can stop this mess. \nOzzimo: &gt;less then what they should be paid.\n\nthis is an opinion. If I say What I think I should be paid, that will certainly be different than what my boss thinks I should be payed. The key is for me to not settle for a wage that will put me on food stamps.\nShanksterr: In my opinion they should be payed more then enough to keep them from going bankrupt. \nOzzimo: yeah I get that. But what did they do to go bankrupt? Were the spending poorly? paying for things they don't need? Was the project simply more than they could handle? \n\nA Studio need project X done.\nVFX says we can do it for Y dollars and it can be done in time.\nThe Studio says cool lets agree to those terms.\n\nThe studio did exactly what they said they would. They hid nothing and are not the big bad enemy here. Blame the CFO of the VFX company. Blame the sales guy for putting up a number they couldn't handle. \nShanksterr: Effects houses aren't completely innocent but the main issue is the following: \n\n\"Studios and production companies want VFX work done quickly, and cheaply.\n\nThose companies don\u2019t only pressure VFX houses to work for less, but to do more work for that ever-smaller amount of money.\n\nThat results in long hours for VFX artists, with overtime not covered in contracts.\n\nAt the same time, studios are doing two things:\n\nOutsourcing jobs to countries such as China and India, who will do the work more cheaply\n\nTaking bids from companies in locations that offer tax breaks. But the tax break goes to the studio, not the effects house.\n\nThis creates a demand for cheap, young labor, and an environment where companies have no leverage with studios, and VFX employees little leverage with their effects house \u2014 they can be replaced.\n\nProfit margins at VFX companies have grown very thin. Some companies can only pay workers for their last job by taking on a new gig. Other companies close divisions (Hugo FX house Pixomondo did this) or lay off dozens to hundreds of employees (Digital Domain and R&amp;H).\"\n\n- See more at: http://www.slashfilm.com/why-visual-effects-artists-protested-outside-the-oscars-and-the-dire-financial-state-of-the-vfx-industry/#more-163302\nOzzimo: This is the same problem that steel mills have. Or video game companies. I'm saying this sin't suddenly some new problem that only effects VXF studios. And we have to accept that we live in a global economy now.  Yeah it sucks that the company in Vancouver can bid lower due to tax rates but that's the reality and it's not changing any time soon. At some point in time the last buggy-whip maker had to say \"Well fuck it, I'm going to try something else.\"\n\nI was a video game tester for 6 years up until recently. I thought if we could just get through the recession I could get payed full time and maybe make a living wage but it never happend. They outsource QA to India just like VFX and I'm here trying to protest my job back, instead I took the skills I learned in QA and now I test websites. I'm saying I've been there and they are looking at this situation all wrong.\nShanksterr: That sucks what happened to your job. Glad you found something. I always wanted to be in the videogames industry. There's no doubt that the industry is doing it wrong. Steel Mills have unions though. we don't. There isn't a way to make everyone happy. I personally like the proposal of vfx companies getting residuals or a bonus if the movie does well. Especially if the main actors are 100% digital (life of pi, avengers, the hobbit, avatar) actors have this option so why not digital actors. I think it's win win. Of course Hollywood will never go for it. \nOzzimo: That sounds great but you have to build that into the contract with studio. They aren't just going to give it to you. And you could very well be part of a union if you wished to be but the Steel workers worked very hard to organize and I would imagine VFX folks would too.\n\nThese are issues that don't have to do with specific studios. If you want  change it either has to be within the company or a huge rule change for the industry.\nShanksterr: Yup exactly, we are trying to organize and push the VFX studios to stand up to the bully. \nOzzimo: Ok but that's not at all clear in the protest. What it sounds like is people are pissed they didn't get money and went out of business. \nShanksterr: I can see how you thought that. It's very complex because there are so many things that need fixing. \nOzzimo: Sure but how is protesting going about change? What's the angle?\nShanksterr: The protest was more about getting picked up by the media and raising awareness at the oscars. Luckily it worked, the news picked it up and key Hollywood figures found out about the protests.\nOzzimo: Well they are aware of \"people protesting\" but I highly doubt anyone is aware of \"VFX artists unionizing and raising awareness of specific issues.\"\n\nI only say this because I was not aware of specific issues until I asked on Reddit and it still wasn't completely clear.\nShanksterr: I honestly don't think any of the Hollywood higher ups really cared or would have even found out what was wanted by the artists. I think it's more important that they knew we are demanding change. I myself didn't know about ALL the issues until I read about it and I'm in the industry. \nOzzimo: &gt;I myself didn't know about ALL the issues until I read about it and I'm in the industry.\n\nDoesn't that say to you that maybe this protest is in need of some clarification then? \nShanksterr: I wasn't at the protest. I live in NYC. I know what they were conveying but I personally don't know about every single issue when it comes to fixing the VFX industry. That's what I meant and that's why I made \"ALL\" in all caps. Now that the protest happened, the media is writing about it and getting all the facts in an organized and widely reachable way. It's very exciting. People are taking notice and I think that's what the protest was about. It wasn't a solution so much as it was fuel to find the answer as a community of artists.\n\nEdit: I'm also not in the film industry (I do TV and commercials)  but it will affect the way business is done\n\nEdit: the protesters I believe mainly focused on incentives and subsidies based on their signs. \n\nEdit.

{"full_text": "who_do_you_trust: How do I tell my friends to stop messing with me?\nSo don't take this the wrong way because I love my friends and I don't know what I'd do without them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut recently some of them have been doing things which make me quite uncomfortable and I have no idea how to address it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I have really long, thick, curly hair which isn't very fun in the wind or rain. And seeing as I live with this weather most of the time it can be a bit of a pain. One of my friends has seemed to think it's okay to joke about 'snatching my wig' (no I don't wear a wig) and then lead on to physically pull my hair, quite harshly may I add. I'm not sure if he just doesn't know that getting your hair pulled can be very painful, or that I'm expressing my pain as a joke or something, but he doesn't seem to stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe spend most of our time outside, despite the atrocious weather, and we tend to leave our bags and such on a wall next to us just so we don't have to stand there holding it. However, I've been feeling uncomfortable doing this for the last month or so because I've noticed that one of my friends has been freely going through my stuff. This wouldn't usually annoy me but I've been carrying some very personal and private things with me that I'd rather not find in somebody else's hands. I don't like to talk about myself much and can be quite closed off about myself, which they say is because I'm just 'a badass type girl', to which I don't particularly disagree but that doesn't mean I'm completely emotionless, right? I keep my personal sketchbook with me at all times, mostly because I don't want other people to be looking through it, but the other day, I just see him and a crowd of people looking through it. Then when I tried to get it back, he put it out of my reach because I'm short as all hell. I finally got it back after fifteen minutes of trying and a torn drawing. And they laughed it off. Apparently sentiment value is worthless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd also, what girl would then allow that same person to just go rummaging through her stuff after that? Because clearly that didn't get through to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then he proceeded to find my, well, girl products, and got embarrassed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery so often, this one would also ask me to stand in the line to buy food with him too. I've not told many people this, but I feel really uncomfortable and claustrophobic in small cramped spaces, or in the middle of crowds. Except they all know I can't stand in crowds for very long. Now, this food line is spread across 7ish meters and at any time, there would be at least 60 people crowded around, making it take at least fifteen minutes to actually buy food. Every time we go past, he almost physically makes me stand there with him and if I leave, or try to leave, he won't talk to me for several days and then lead a conversation by criticising something I've said and pulling my hair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, as 'badass' as I may come across, I have a strong dislike for unnecessary violence. Pretty standard, right? Considering the majority of my friend group are guys, there's a lot of rough housing, and somehow that has come upon me. I'm constantly getting pushed and shoved even though I make it extremely clear that I did not like it. I accidentally revealed (they read through my stuff) that I'm quite experienced in martial arts and self defence, which is what I think triggered this but honestly I'm not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't know what to do. I tried asking nicely, politely, but this all continued and I don't want to hurt any of them as the ones I've mentioned can be emotionally unstable and such. Any advice is much appreciated \nSashere: Setting healthy boundaries can be difficult, especially if the people you're dealing with are somewhat immature. It's completely reasonable to set a boundary of not going through your backpack. It's completely reasonable to expect to not have your hair pulled. If you do some research online about how to set healthy boundaries, usually it involves calmly but firmly stating, \"Hey, it's not okay to go through my backpack. That's private.\" If they respond with anything other than, \"Oh, I'm sorry, my bad. It won't happen again.\" then you need to put some distance between yourself and that person. Don't hang out with them and be friends anymore because they aren't a true friend if they can't respect reasonable boundaries. You can also phrase it like, \"how would you feel about me going through your backpack and showing your private stuff to random people?\" if they give you any pushback. The key is to stay calm and reasonable and be prepared to exit that social scene for good if those people can't respect you. Like your friend wouldn't hang with you for a few days since you wouldn't stand in line with him... flip the script. If they can't respect you, they don't get to hang with you. \nwho_do_you_trust: I think that\u2019s what I needed to hear, but the thing is, this is just a few people from a group of about ten of us and I\u2019m not really ready to leave all of my friends because two or three of them don\u2019t respect these boundaries \nSashere: I can understand that. I would still recommend making your boundaries clear in a calm voice and trying to avoid those who don't respect your boundaries as much as possible. Is anyone else in the group bothered by some of these behaviors? Is anyone else getting their backpack gone through? Can you enlist help from others in the group? Even something like, hey this one guy in our group pulls my hair and goes through my backpack. Can you help me keep an eye on my stuff? Can you stick up for me when I tell him to cut it out?

His mother decided to have an open casket to show the world what they did to her son.\n\nEyerainianCowboy: There\u2019s a lot more details to this story and why he looked like this. Very sad story and ending.\nMirions: Pretty sure the woman who lied about the events is still alive, too (if not the murderers as well). This wasn't that long ago in the country's history.\nIKindaLikeRunning: She still denies that his death was her fault (it was).\nnworb200: It was her husbands fault. She had a play in it, but even if everything she said was true her husband still shouldn't have tortured and killed a kid.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Lol no it was 100% HER FAULT for lying. You forget the entire situation would\u2019ve never even happened had it not been for the fact SHE LIED\nSt1834: That's not true.  You can watch [this interview](https://www.matteroffact.tv/full-interview-timothy-tyson-author-blood-emmett-till/) with an historian who investigated the whole thing.  Her husband was actually told something by someone else who was in the store when Till was there.\nBeautifulArtistic649: He never whistled at her though so that\u2019s not true. It was HER who told him in fact she quite literally confessed and said SHE did it. It even says ON the video \u201cCarolyn Bryant, the white shopkeeper who testified that Till had made sexual advances, now says \u201cthat part\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nHow could somebody in the shop have told if he never even did it in the first place?\nSt1834: You're confused.  She might have confessed (this part apparently wasn't recorded by the author she was talking to) to lying at the trial when she exaggerated the encounter and said that Till grabbed her waist.  She didn't lie to her husband or say anything to him.  Someone else in the store told him something.  \n\nAnd accounts differ on whether Till whistled and, if so, why.  His cousin said he whistled at Bryant as a joke.  Some other people say he whistled at a card game.  His mother said he whistled as a verbal tic.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Exactly so there is no concrete proof or claim HE whistled at HER. Also I\u2019m not lying, she admitted TO telling her husband.\nSt1834: Again, she was referencing her lying at the trial when she told the jury that Till grabbed her waist.  That was all she said she lied about.  As for way before that, what led to her husband finding out about this encounter, someone at the store told her husband something.\n\nAnd every account from his friends and family he was with agrees there was a whistle of some kind, just disagrees as to why.  No one says it was malicious.  What Till's mother said about him whistling to overcome a speech impediment is the most likely explanation.\nBeautifulArtistic649: No she wasn\u2019t she said she was lying about him whistling in the first place she confessed on her deathbed. He couldn\u2019t have found out from somebody at the store BECAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED. \n\nOkay, a whistle of some kind doesn\u2019t mean it was directed at her that\u2019s my whole point so what could anybody have told his husband?? \u201cA black boy randomly whistled while your wife was walking by\u201d?? Like what?\nSt1834: &gt;[Carolyn Bryant testified in 1955 that 14-year-old Emmett Till grabbed her and verbally threatened her three days before her husband and brother-in-law abducted and tortured the teenager to death. Five decades later, she confessed, \u201cThat part\u2019s not true.\u201d](https://eji.org/news/emmett-till-accuser-admits-she-lied/) \n\n&gt;[In August 1955, the Chicago youth was visiting family in Sumner County, Mississippi, when he entered Roy Bryant\u2019s country store to buy some bubble gum. Bryant\u2019s wife, Carolyn, was working in the store and spent about one minute alone with Till before others heard him whistle at her. (As Vanity Fair reports, he was said to have a lisp and may not have actually whistled.)](https://eji.org/news/emmett-till-accuser-admits-she-lied/)\nBeautifulArtistic649: What does this prove\nSt1834: It doesn't really prove anything.  Nothing needs to be proven.  This is just teaching you the sequence of events.  Bryant didn't say she lied to her husband, like you think for some reason.  She lied at the trial when she said Till grabbed her.  Till did whistle, for some reason.  Someone at the store saw it and told her husband about it.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Wrong again like I literally just told you she said she lied about him whistling AT HER and multiple other things. He never whistled AT her so why would they go and tell somebody and why would he assume it was at his wife? Also one link is just the same exact thing and doesn\u2019t include the information you said about somebody talking about the whistling\nSt1834: Yes, that is what you keep saying but, as the articles I show you show, that's not right.  Again, she never actually said Till whistled at her.  The people with him have said he whistled.  The most likely explanation was provided by his mother, that it was a speech impediment.  Someone in the store saw this and told her husband.\n\nAgain, Bryant said she lied at the trial.  The lie was that he grabbed her.\nBeautifulArtistic649: What you just said don\u2019t make no sense. How could she not have mentioned the whistling YET claimed they sexually assaulted her?!She surely did both. And also it\u2019s not as if her husband heard about it and went ASAP to go kill Emmet no he had to GO HOME, discuss it with her, and THEN he got her family members and came back and killed Emmet. So if she didn\u2019t lie about the whistle why wouldn\u2019t she said her husband was wrong when he came home to her?? She knew EXACTLY what he was doing and let it happen. It\u2019s her fault. Why would somebody mention Emmet whistling and then go tell somebody that makes 0 sense why would anybody care\nSt1834: &gt;How could she not have mentioned the whistling YET claimed they sexually assaulted her?!She surely did both.\n\nNo.  She said at the trial not that he whistled at her, but that he grabbed her and actually talked to her.  She exaggerated at the trial. Everyone agrees there was a whistle.  The grabbing and verbal assault is what she lied about.\n\n&gt;And also it\u2019s not as if her husband heard about it and went ASAP to go kill Emmet no he had to GO HOME, discuss it with her\n\nNo, her husband was away on a trip and didn't come back until a week after this encounter.  Then, someone who witnessed the encounter told him about it. He and the person who told him about the encounter went to find who it was.  They went around trying to find him and questioning several young black men.  He figured out it was Till, grabbed his brother, and they went and kidnapped him.\nBeautifulArtistic649: No she lied about him whistling AT HER. I never said he didn\u2019t whistle.\n\nNo he didn\u2019t because he literally got his family members to come with him to do it. \n\nAlso like I said WHY would they say a black boy whistled?? How is that relevant to anything\nSt1834: &gt;No she lied about him whistling AT HER. \n\nShe didn't say anything about whistling.  Again, his cousin said he whistled at her as a joke.  Others said he whistled at a card game.  But this was all in interviews long after the incident.\n\n&gt;No he didn\u2019t because he literally got his family members to come with him to do it.\n\nNo he didn't...what?  These are facts.  He came home a few days after the incident, a friend told him about the incident, they went and figured out it was with Till, then he and his brother kidnapped Till.\n\n&gt;Also like I said WHY would they say a black boy whistled?? \n\nBecause he did.  All accounts agree he did.  The most likely reason was a speech impediment.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Why tf would a random ass person care that a black boy whistled and WHY would he assume he whistled at his wife that\u2019s my whole point it makes 0 sense\nSt1834: It wasn't a random ass person, it was a friend of the family.  And something like that was taken as an incredible affront back then.  Till's friends and family who were with them describe running home and being terrified at the perception that Till whistled at her because people got lynched over that stuff.\nBeautifulArtistic649: Okay so, your telling me.. he whistled, somebody told her husband be whistled and he was like \u201coh my god he must\u2019ve whistled at my wife!!\u201d???\nSt1834: Sounds like you don't understand the significance of whistling. [Maybe listen to Till's cousin, who was there] (https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/January-2010/Eyewitness-Account-Emmett-Tills-cousin-Simeon-Wright-seeks-to-set-the-record-straight/)\n\n&gt;The essentials of the story are familiar: The Chicagoan Emmett Till and his cousin Wheeler Parker Jr. were visiting the Wright family in August 1955. The boys, along with a group of friends and cousins, were in Bryant\u2019s Grocery and Meat Market in Money when Emmett whistled at Carolyn Bryant, who was white and who owned the store with her husband, Roy Bryant.\n\n&gt;\u201cI think [Emmett] wanted to get a laugh out of us or something,\u201d Wright says. \u201cHe was always joking around, and it was hard to tell when he was serious.\u201d\n\n&gt;This was no joking matter. The Mississippi Delta region was at the epicenter of an eruption, where \u201cthe Ku Klux Klan and night riders were part of our daily lives,\u201d Wright recalls in the book. All this was on Wright\u2019s mind when he heard that whistle.\n\n&gt;\u201cWell, it scared us half to death,\u201d he recalls in an interview. \u201cYou know, we were almost in shock. We couldn\u2019t get out of there fast enough, because we had never heard of anything like that before. A black boy whistling at a white woman? In Mississippi?

Of course not.\n\nHonestly, it's hard to tell if we've stepped forward or backward these last few years. Either way, it's not been good.\nDmon1Unlimited: &gt; this X Lives Matter shit\n\nIt isn't something to get over.\n\nWhite lives matter spun off over ignorant bigots not understanding the point of black lives matter... even now people don't seem to comprehend that saying BLM does not mean their lives matter more...\n\nWhat is uplifting is that it seems there are not so many hard-core bigots that they needed to join this stupid WLM rally\n\n'Be as one' is as tone deaf as the people chanting all lives matter. The whole point of BLM was to 'be as one'...\nsaltesc: Look at what segregating one skin colour, as good as it's intentions were, caused.\n\nSurprise, surprise, an Us vs Them mentality that humans always thrive positive outcomes from /s\n\nNot saying BLM is a bad thing in concept, but look at the headlines we get to read now (OP). Yup. That's the outcome you'll get when something highlighting any individual skin colour goes down to ironically stop racism. We now have sides, divisions, Us vs Them. Mmmmhm. Never underestimate the stupidity and selfishness of our species. That's how we got racism in the first place and that's how it'll keep on lingering.\nDmon1Unlimited: BLM has allowed a lot of positive changes...  the fact that ignorant bigots not even understanding what BLM is isn't BLMs fault \n\nBlame the idiots not the cause. BLM is needed for 'us to be as one' because obviously a lot of idiots seem to think we are already 'as one' while ignoring the inequalities. That's why you get fools rallying All Lives Matter (obviously all lives matter, but this is a stupid blanket statement, all lives matter when black lives matter. Hell, with the rise of asian hate crimes, that is also why you have asian lives matter too)\n\nUseless bigots existing is not a reason why these causes shouldn't exist\n\nIt's like not wanting to raise awareness for gay pride because useless bigots will then cry about wanting straight pride. Your priorities are misplaced... blame the bigots not the cause\nsaltesc: It has also been a big drive of increased racial groups, bigotry, and all the people around here that high five each other on saying it's fundamentally a terrorist group.\n\nBy underestimating our own stupidity, there have been plenty of negatives too.\n\nThese are the sort of things MLK also talked about and these parts seem to have been forgotten for others.\n\nSome examples...\n\n&gt;A riot is the language of the unheard.\n\n&gt;Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\n\nHowever...\n\n&gt;The limitation of riots, moral questions aside, is that they cannot win and their participants know it. Hence, rioting is not revolutionary but reactionary because it invites defeat. It involves an emotional catharsis, but it must be followed by a sense of futility.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;The more there are riots, the more repressive action will take place, and the more we face the danger of a right-wing takeover and eventually a fascist society.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction.\n\nSo\n\n&gt;Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.\n\n&gt;Let no man pull you so low as to hate him.\n\nBecause\n\n&gt;Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.\nDmon1Unlimited: Again... you are belittling the need to have such causes because you can't seem to blame the bigots instead of the cause\n\nYou're effectively victim blaming and these quotes don't change that. Just because bigots exist is not the fault of the cause that try and raise awareness for inequality\n\nDo you even understand why BLM exists? Do you realise that all BLM protests are not just riots? \ud83d\ude44\nsaltesc: Not at all correct.\n\nI'm blaming narrow-mindedness in reaction; poor execution. We shouldn't see outcomes like these, but we do because we have bigotry and selfishness on all sides that screams the loudest, is heard the farthest, and damages the most.\n\nIt is simply a shame to see such potential wasted and ironically damaging because of all the fools we forget to plan for.\n\nIf you can't see the clear \"What about me?\"-ism and division we have now, you're part of the problem. You may as well pick one of the sides and keep flailing your arms for \"progress\". You'll end up having gotten no where but you will have made things more divided.\nDmon1Unlimited: &gt;because we have bigotry and selfishness on all sides\n\nThis is just victim blaming nonsense \ud83d\ude44 \nIt isn't all sides that have the problem \n\nWhere is the bigotry and selfishness in having a cause to raise awareness of inequality for black people? \ud83d\ude44\n\nNo shit we have whataboutme-ism (it's called whataboutism) thats why white lives matter exists. It still doesn't change the fact that this isn't the fault of BLM\n\nAgain, your priorities are skewed. Do you even know why BLM exists? Or that all the protests are not riots? Because your comments seem to imply no.\n\nBigots saying white lives matter didn't just exist before BLM.... these bigots always existed and are part of why such inequality even exists in the first place.\n\nMeanwhile people like you taking this BS fence-sitter' approach are also part of the problem. habing a 'both sides suck' argument doesn't make your appear neutral, it just shows your own ignorance.  The rest of your comment about reaction/execution is just an extension of such ignorance. Pure fluffer material\nsaltesc: That's precisely my point. Thanks.\n\nNow if you'd like to tell me how WLM came about and how it helps?\n\nI'd also like to think about the reason why we're actually going back and forth in disagreeance right now too\u2014providing nothing but unproductive and dividing discourse to really help keep that racism/not-racism snowball going. Are we helping stop racism by doing this? I think I've made it quite clear that my personal opinion is that shit like this makes it worse because, at the core, it is division, no matter how good the intentions. You'll see, we'll spark another debate about who's right who's wrong and who matters. That'll fix it!\nDmon1Unlimited: WLM came about because of bigots who ALREADY existed long before BLM came about \n\nYour other comment talking about changing to Minorities Lives Matter shows you don't even understand. What next? all lives matter sounds better?Watered down nonsense. The wording doesn't need to be changed... bigots just need to understand. Most people do not need a damn name change to comprehend wtf it means...\n\nI've made it clear that you are part of the problem... your comments show your ignorance. You victim blame the cause just because the bigots that already existed are reacting to it. Even if you don't shout out WLM, your comments are still problematic af...\n\nAgain, what is the bigotry and selfishness in raising awareness of the inequality of black people .. \ud83d\ude44\n\nAre you going to substantiate upon this nonsense comment you made below? \n&gt;because we have bigotry and selfishness on all sides\n\nThis is just a cop out\n\nAre you also going to reply to any of my questions? Do you comprehend that not all protests are riots? Do you understand what the cause is even about?\nsaltesc: &gt;Your other comment talking about changing to Minorities Lives Matter shows you don't even understand. The wording doesn't need to be changed...\n\nSo you think all the amplified shit we see of ALM, WLM, BlueLM, etc. would've just amplified itself louder at this time by itself?\n\nYou don't think racist people going overdrive racist has anything to do with a movement that segregated a single skin colour that is not theirs'? You don't think this could've been a huge social opportunity with much more progress had things been done more tactfully; like, I don't know, *not* responding to anger with anger? Not responding to hate with hate? Not being so naive as to think racist people will suddenly get it once repeatedly slapped with it in the face? How has that ever worked in history, *especially* in racism. I mean, you can read those MLK quotes again, but I think you probably won't.\n\nYou're entitled to keep going down whatever mindset you like, I think you're just missing a lot more than you are contributing. I mean, how are you going to have discourse with a racist person with opinion like this? I genuinely believe we'd just see them do what they're doing now; dig heels, yell over you. Nothing done but more division. Surely you can't think otherwise.\n\n&gt;Again, what is the bigotry and selfishness in raising awareness of the inequality of black people .. \ud83d\ude44\n\nUh, there isn't? I've said all along, it's how it is done. How it has been done lately is, in my opinion, very disheartening to see. We have a huge increase in fascist groups now FFS. Again, this is MLK quoted up top.\n\nHow could anyone be happy with these sorts step forward/step backward outcomes? Just in it to pat oneself on the back to shallowly feel good?\nDmon1Unlimited: Again... blame the damn racists for going into racist overdrive rather than the cause trying to raise awareness of their damn adversity?\n\nGay pride also triggers people and want straight pride. Does that mean gay pride shouldn't exist?\n\nHow hard is that to comprehend? You are victim blaming just because racist bigots WHICH ALREADY exist don't like it \n\nSince when is the having BLM 'raising anger with anger'? \ud83d\ude44\n\n\nMy god you can't even comprehend how you're victim blaming. It's pathetic, you're doing all you can to appease the bigots instead of addressing them. Just like your name change BS. You're no different to the fools chanting ALM\nsaltesc: &gt;Again... blame the damn racists for going into racist overdrive rather than the cause trying to raise awareness of their damn adversity?\n\nBut we know they'll do that as they always do and very little progress is made. So why would we behave like them rather than overcome their ignorance by reaching them?\n\n&gt;Gay pride also triggers people and want straight pride. Does that mean gay pride shouldn't exist?\n\nI'm glad you mentioned this. I was at a gay bar with friends the other week when two men realised it was a gay bar and started being quite loud and obnoxious about it. Pure ignorance.\n\nSo I made friends with them, talked to them, introduced them to my friends. In 30 mins we were having a great time and they were very apologetic and honestly surprised that gay people are normal people which we were all understanding of.\n\nGay Pride and the \"homos in the parade\" made them think all gay people were just leather strapped hornbags that weren't real men. To which our group explained that's why they don't really like the Gay Pride movement because it makes them feel segregated when they just want to be seen as a normal person.\n\nMorgan Freeman boycotts Black History Month for the same reason. It shouldn't be like that for black people. As he says, \"I'm American; not African-American\"\n\nNow how do you think those two men would've behaved if I said, \"Did you not see the big fucking rainbow flag at the door? There's gay pride here and you should leave if you can't accept that.\"\n\nWell, I'm sure they'd never have budged their bigotry. Instead, they are back in town in two months and want to hang out with us again at the same bar.\n\nLove, understanding, and kindness breakdown bigotry. What doesn't is equally responding with opposing loudness and ignorance, shoving something in a bigots face that they fear and expecting some sort of change under threat.\n\n&gt;How hard is that to comprehend? You are victim blaming just because racist bigots WHICH ALREADY exist don't like it \n\nI am victim blaming no one. I'm saying that it's a shame we're in the situation we're in because of fighting fire with fire.\n\n&gt;Since when is the having BLM 'raising anger with anger'? \ud83d\ude44\n\nUhh...\n\n&gt;My god you can't even comprehend how you're victim blaming. It's pathetic, you're doing all you can to appease the bigots instead of addressing them. Just like your name change BS. You're no different to the fools chanting ALM\n\nMy \"name change BS\" was a hypothetical that immediately is followed by knowing that even then I'm sure we'd find another way to make it all a mess because I have that little faith in a humanity that thrives in division, such as you are now. That's why we're still at this despite having the same overall desire for humanity.\n\nPretty funny, huh?\nDmon1Unlimited: &gt;But we know they'll do that as they always do and very little progress is made. So why would we behave like them rather than overcome their ignorance by reaching them?\n\nVery little profess is made? I literally gave you various examples where progress was made by BLM that you ignorantly ignore. Since when is anyone behaving like them? Tolerant people supporting BLM is NOT the same thing as racists supporting WLM \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\n&gt;I'm glad you mentioned this. I was at a gay bar with friends the other week when two men realised it was a gay bar and started being quite loud and obnoxious about it. Pure ignorance.\n\n&gt;So I made friends with them, talked to them, introduced them to my friends. In 30 mins we were having a great time and they were very apologetic and honestly surprised that gay people are normal people which we were all understanding of.\n\n&gt;Gay Pride and the \"homos in the parade\" made them think all gay people were just leather strapped hornbags that weren't real men. To which our group explained that's why they don't really like the Gay Pride movement because it makes them feel segregated when they just want to be seen as a normal person.\n\nNo one gives a shit about where you were at and whether you were having a good time with them. Are you actually blaming the gay bar now that the men were being loud and obnoxious? It's like you lack the competence to even understand what victim blaming is\n\nThe fact that they were initially and obnoxious is not the fault of the bar for existing... People should not have to cater for the stupid assumptions that idiots make... can you not comprehend that not everyone would think the same way as them whenever they hear about gay pride? \n\nLol you want to talk about fallacies like strawman and then you cop out by talking about what Morgan Freeman thinks?  You now hide behind him like you did with MLK. \n\n\n&gt;Now how do you think those two men would've behaved if I said, \"Did you not see the big fucking rainbow flag at the door? There's gay pride here and you should leave if you can't accept that.\"\n\n&gt;Well, I'm sure they'd never have budged their bigotry. Instead, they are back in town in two months and want to hang out with us again at the same bar.\n\nThis is where more of your comprehension issues come from.\n\nYour example here is of being hostile to them and that's it. Who are you to make out like BLM is just one hostile entity? You want an award for helping to educate some people? What you did does not change the need for gay bars or gay pride...\n\n&gt;Love, understanding, and kindness breakdown bigotry. What doesn't is equally responding with opposing loudness and ignorance, shoving something in a bigots face that they fear and expecting some sort of change under threat.\n\nNone of that delegitimises the existence of BLM... you refer to ignorant people making bad assumptions. Can you not comprehend that even if BLM didn't exist that ignorant people would still he making assumptions? You do realise homophobia can still be rampant in places that don't have far pride or gay bars?\n\nYou are victim blaming because you're diverting the blame onto the cause. It's not their fault people make ignorant assumptions. And based on your shit example, you are one of them if you think simply having a cause therefore means automatically being hostile..\n\n&gt;Uhh...\n\nshall I keep repeating myself until you form an actual response?  Again... Since when is the BLM 'raising anger with anger'? \ud83d\ude44\n\n\n&gt;My \"name change BS\" was a hypothetical that immediately is followed by knowing that even then I'm sure we'd find another way to make it all a mess because I have that little faith in a humanity that thrives in division, such as you are now. That's why we're still at this despite having the same overall desire for humanity.\n\nYour name change BS was flawed to begin with regardless of whether you think even that would turn into a mess.\n\nOnce again, you ignorantly deflect blame onto people raising awareness. You ignore all the good that the cause has done just so you can appease ignorant bigots. You make BS assumptions that such causes are hostile, this is as ignorant as the assumptions those homophobes made. Just because you made friends with them still doesn't change the fact that it isn't the fault of the gay bar or gay pride\n\n\nRepeat after me: what BS assumptions bigots make is not the fault of the cause...\nsaltesc: &gt;Very little profess is made? I literally gave you various examples where progress was made by BLM that you ignorantly ignore. Since when is anyone behaving like them? Tolerant people supporting BLM is NOT the same thing as racists supporting WLM \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI don't think you're seeing the big picture of progress here.\n\n&gt;No one gives a shit about where you were at and whether you were having a good time with them. Are you actually blaming the gay bar now that the men were being loud and obnoxious? It's like you lack the competence to even understand what victim blaming is\n\nJesus fucking Christ. That's...alarming.\n\nYour character is becoming very clear and I'm not dropping to whatever sick level you're on...\n\nSo, yeah. That's exactly right. I'm blaming a gay bar for two individuals deep-seeded misconceptions of people's sexual preference.\n\n*Naaailed it*\n\n&gt;The fact that they were initially and obnoxious is not the fault of the bar for existing... People should not have to cater for the stupid assumptions that idiots make... can you not comprehend that not everyone would think the same way as them whenever they hear about gay pride? \n\nWhat the actual fuck are you on about?\n\n&gt;Lol you want to talk about fallacies like strawman\n\nOh, here we go...\n\n&gt;SM. *The fact that they were initially and obnoxious is not the fault of the bar for existing*\n\nHow the fuck did you get there? Who the fuck said that?\n\n&gt;SM. *People should not have to cater for the stupid assumptions that idiots make*\n\nWhat in the actual fuck are you on about? Am I missing a third-party here?\n\n&gt;SM. *can you not comprehend that not everyone would think the same way as them whenever they hear about gay pride?*\n\nIt's literally a story about people of different ways of thinking reaching out to each other.\n\nI don't know what you're trying to argue against here but... Wow. You're imaginative.\n\n&gt;SM. *and then you cop out by talking about what Morgan Freeman thinks?  You now hide behind him like you did with MLK.*\n\nThat's citation of relevant opinion. It's hard to say if you're attacking these people, or you're attacking the idea that I'm using citation and shouldn't. Either way, you've disregarded it all to attack something unrelated to what was actually said.\n\n&gt;Your example here is of being hostile to them and that's it.\n\nI don't understand what you're trying to-... Oooh, wait...\n\n&gt;SM. *Who are you to make out like BLM is just one hostile entity?*\n\nUh-huh...\n\n&gt;SM. *You want an award for helping to educate some people? What you did does not change the need for gay bars or gay pride...*\n\nFucking whoooooooosh.\n\n&gt;SM. *None of that delegitimises the existence of BLM... you refer to ignorant people making bad assumptions. Can you not comprehend that even if BLM didn't exist that ignorant people would still he making assumptions?*\n\nNo shit. But I'm not saying that, am I? Oh, wait, your straw man is. Keep attacking!!!\n\n&gt;SM. You do realise homophobia can still be rampant in places that don't have far pride or gay bars?\n\n................You done? I almost feel sorry you wasted all that time completely and utterly off the mark.\n\nThis answer may come as a shock to you, but... No shit.\n\nHonestly don't know how you managed to do that but, kudos.\n\n&gt;You are victim blaming because you're diverting the blame onto the cause.\n\nI'll regret this, but I'm curious. And I'm sure it'll end up with another strawman whose argument is something like, \"BLM done brung racism onto themselfs!\"\n\nOr \"I reckon folk should be less vigilant to racist so they're not so pissed off as much!\"\n\nEven, \"The world is flat! FLM! FLM!\"\n\nBut...\n\nWhat blame are you referring to that's being diverted? And did you mean to use the word \"diverting\"?\n\n&gt;SM. *It's not their fault people make ignorant assumptions. And based on your shit example, you are one of them if you think simply having a cause therefore means automatically being hostile..*\n\nYup. That's *exactly* what I'm saying. So astute!\n\n&gt;shall I keep repeating myself until you form an actual response?  Again... Since when is the BLM 'raising anger with anger'? \ud83d\ude44\n\nYou've been under a rock. Go Google instances yourself.\n\n&gt;Your name change BS was flawed to begin with regardless of whether you think even that would turn into a mess.\n\nAddressing racism without segregating a race is flawed? Shit. Someone tell all the other racial minorities that tried raising all their cases of fatalities to police, racial profiling, incarceration rates, poor living, and denied rights they raised at the same time (just as bad), but missed the train.\n\nYou need to tell them there's a racism queue. Fighting racism works one race at a time and they gotta wait.\n\nKeep your energy focused, soldier lol.\n\n&gt;SM. *Once again, you ignorantly deflect blame onto people raising awareness. You ignore all the good that the cause has done just so you can appease ignorant bigots.*\n\nWon't even bother at this point. Still, incredibly impressed though.\n\n&gt;SM. *You make BS assumptions that such causes are hostile*\n\nI mean, we went through that. Half strawnman though. Refer to being under a rock and Google.\n\n&gt;this is as ignorant as the assumptions those homophobes made.\n\nWhoosh.\n\n&gt;SM. *Just because you made friends with them still doesn't change the fact that it isn't the fault of the gay bar or gay pride*\n\nOh, that wasn't my option. You would know this though if you read properly. I'm quite indifferent.\n\n&gt;SM. *Repeat after me: what BS assumptions bigots make is not the fault of the cause...*\n\nI'm so sick of saying \"No shit\" but... No shit. How do you think causes come about?\n\nGod, that was exhausting. Done!\nDmon1Unlimited: You relying on your ignorant victim blaming view doesn't mean I'm not looking at the bigger picture\n\n\nYou don't even comprehend how shit your gay bar annecdote is. Again no one cares about your flawed annecdote. Just because you managed to educate some people doesn't mean you can educate everyone nor does it mean it is wrong for the gay bar or gay pride to exist. You made a stupidly baseless assumption of such causes being hostile. \n\nHow incompetent does a person have to be to not comprehend the fact that the stupid assumptions of idiots is no one else's problem?  Either BLM exist or not these bigots will still make ignorant assumptions. But because you managed to make friends with two former bigots you therefore think the blame should lie on gay pride etc for the homophobes making stupid assumptions? Your own stupid annecdote shows how you are victim blaming \n\n\n&gt;It's literally a story about people of different ways of thinking reaching out to each other.\n\n&gt;I don't know what you're trying to argue against here but... Wow. You're imaginative.\n\nThe stupidity in this \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  your stupid story does not mean you should point fingers at the gay pride.. those bigots made ignorant assumptions and you educated them. Thats all. The blame is all on them... yet you ignorantly make out that gay pride is the problem and made a BS assumption that they being hostile is the reason why the bigots exist.. if isn't. Youre fucking generalising based on your small minded annecodote.\n\n\n&gt;No shit. But I'm not saying that, am I? Oh, wait, your straw man is. Keep attacking!!!\n\nYou ARE saying that fool. You said that when you pointed fingers at both sides instead of the bigots. You said that when you mentioned being as 'stupid and unfactful' and 'behaving' the same as the bigots. You said that in your stupid gay bar example when you talked about people saying 'this is a gay bar, if you don't like it then leave'.  Just because some people may be hostile doesn't mean the damn cause is the problem \n\n\n&gt;That's citation of relevant opinion. It's hard to say if you're attacking these people, or you're attacking the idea that I'm using citation and shouldn't. Either way, you've disregarded it all to attack something unrelated to what was actually said.\n\nYoure literally coping out by mentioning a statement of a black guy.... no one cares about your Morgan Freeman point either because guess what? One person is not representative of everyone. You simply use them because they reconfirm your bias \n\nAgain. You regurgitating the word 'strawman' over and over again doesn't make your flawed points any less flawed. Again do you even know what the hell straw man means?  Same imbecile called out strawman when I called out for you to substantiate your own quote. You're simply using strawman as a stupid cop out\n\nAre you too incompetent to understand that you're blaming the cause by pointing fingers at them and implying they are as hostile/behave the same as the bigots? Are you too incompetent to comprehend that in your own gay bar example you ignorantly blame the gar bar rather than the bigots?  Once again fool, if someone seems to be hostile e.g. telling them to accept it or leave then talk to THAT person. What they said does not mean you can generalise an entire demographic \n\n&gt;&gt;SM. Repeat after me: what BS assumptions bigots make is not the fault of the cause...\n\n&gt;I'm so sick of saying \"No shit\" but... No shit. How do you think causes come about?\n\n\nYou want to post crap saying no shit and yet you do the very thing I said you're doing. If you can comprehend the fact that idiots are responsible for their own stupid arguments then stop blaming BLM for the fact that bigots outrage and scream WLM\n\nThe incompetence is unreal. I wonder how many times you'll wrongly claim strawman to cop out this time \ud83d\ude44\n\nYou lack the critical thinking to even see the flaws in your comments. You don't see what is wrong with your BS example. You don't even see the flaws in hiding behind the people you quote when they are not representative of all black people. Can you not comprehend that not every black person cares what stupidly simple things Morgan Freeman says (inb4 no-shit when you incompetently  brought him up anyway). You make various ignorant assumptions that form the basis of your flawed comments and you don't seem to want to acknowledge it.\n\n\n&gt;Gay Pride and the \"homos in the parade\" made them think ... \n\nNo one MADE these bigots think that way.\n\n&gt;Now how do you think those two men would've behaved if I said, \"Did you not see the big fucking rainbow flag at the door? There's gay pride here and you should leave if you can't accept that.\"\n\nThis is the premise of your incompetence. (Big shocker if you cop out yet again by saying I'm strawmanning for quoting your own ignorant comments)...\n\nThis stupid narrative you painted in your head of hostility does not mean you can generalise an entire damn cause as being like this... you wrongly generalise BLM and gay pride.. if someone talks like that then talk to that person instead of pointing fingers at them\n\nJesus Christ the lack of education is unreal\nsaltesc: &gt;You don't even comprehend how shit your gay bar annecdote is.

Just because you managed to educate some people doesn't mean you can educate everyone nor does it mean it is wrong for the gay bar or gay pride to exist.

Not pointing fingers at the Gay Pride movement.\n\nDespite saying I don't care, how do you see that as me pointing fingers of blame at the cause? I'm not even involved in that opinion lol. I am merely responding to your bombastic statement, \"gay pride triggers people so it shouldn't exist, eeeer?\" with some food for thought about opinions of the Gay Pride movement from both sides of third-parties (NOT ME) and how neither stance fit into the unrealistic simplistic way anthropology plays out in your head.\n\nSo, you've utterly misread/misinterpreted that  and built a false opinion for me that isn't even mine.\n\nGood job.\n\nBut also not the actual point of the story which I don't think you'll ever figure out at this point.\n\n&gt;Thats all. The blame is all on them... yet you ignorantly make out that gay pride is the problem and made a BS assumption that they being hostile is the reason why the bigots exist.. if isn't. Youre fucking generalising based on your small minded annecodote.\n\nI don't know why you keep challenging this strawman thing.\n\nI won't say again, that this is not my point or opinion.\n\nStop. Fucking. Arguing. It.\n\nHave you not noticed that at this point, the majority of what I say to you now is literally trying to steer you back on track because I don't know what the fuck you're going on about?\n\nStop it.\n\nJust stop. Get back on track or stop.\n\n\"Oh that's because you're dumb.\"\n\nNo. You're literally talking about shit I have not said at any point.\n\n&gt;You ARE saying that fool. You said that when you pointed fingers at both sides instead of the bigots.\n\nJust gonna leave this here...\n\n&gt;&gt;some people may be hostile\n\n&gt;You said that when you mentioned being as 'stupid and unfactful' and 'behaving' the same as the bigots.\n\n&gt;&gt;some people may be hostile\n\n&gt;You said that in your stupid gay bar example when you talked about people saying 'this is a gay bar, if you don't like it then leave'.\n\nOkay, no one said that. But also...\n\n&gt;&gt;some people may be hostile\n\n...........\n\n&gt;Just because **some people may be hostile** doesn't mean the damn cause is the problem \n\nI'm going to have an aneurysm.\n\nSo when I say some people can be hostile and if they weren't things would be better with the BLM movement. This is different to you saying\n\n&gt;Just because some people may be hostile doesn't mean the damn cause is the problem\n\nYou *just* responded to yourself with my own point except mine goes further to say that that if this were improved there'd be more progress. But we don't want this and it's blame?! Whereas you just say, \"the damn cause is not the problem\"...for some unrelated reason. I think in your mind it's okay to have hostile people in the movement because it's still good. But in my mind it's not okay because things like hostility aren't as productive as not hostility.\n\nI feel like this was a breakthrough. But I doubt it.\n\n&gt;Youre literally coping out by mentioning a statement of a black guy.... no one cares about your Morgan Freeman point either because guess what? One person is not representative of everyone. You simply use them because they reconfirm your bias \n\nThat's a good point. Except I know he got a lot of praise for it and it has been ongoing debate for change to help fight against racism ever since. To be quite honest, I'm surprised you don't seem to know of it, despite your supposed passion for equality, so no common ground there, just me \"hiding\". But here's [some food for thought anyway](https://youtu.be/Mh8mUia75k8). It's good.\n\nThere. Now misconstrue me as you see fit. I know you will!\n\n&gt;Again. You regurgitating the word 'strawman' over and over again doesn't make your flawed points any less flawed. Again do you even know what the hell straw man means?  Same imbecile called out strawman when I called out for you to substantiate your own quote. You're simply using strawman as a stupid cop out\n\nIt means you're refuting arguments that I am not raising without properly addressing the topic\u2014which I'm sure you have totally forgotten what is at this point. You go off counter-arguing some shit I don't even know where you get from. The funny thing is some of the time I agree with you because you're arguing at something I also think is very wrong. But then I realise it's because you thought that was what I said.\n\nA lot of it I think is you just don't read everything or you're too eager to respond with an \"I can't be wrong!\" mentality. So you just skim and fill the blanks and go to town.\n\nIt gets confusing, but I'm learning to understand you and just respond with simple \"Nope\" or \"Didn't say that\" stuff.\n\n&gt;Are you too incompetent to understand that you're blaming the cause by pointing fingers at them and implying they are as hostile/behave the same as the bigots?\n\nJust leave this here again...\n\n&gt;&gt;ust because some people may be hostile doesn't mean the damn cause is the problem\n\nThere ya go.\n\n&gt;Are you too incompetent to comprehend that in your own gay bar example you ignorantly blame the gar bar rather than the bigots?  Once again fool, if someone seems to be hostile e.g. telling them to accept it or leave then talk to THAT person. What they said does not mean you can generalise an entire demographic \n\nNot what was said. Also, I'd never generalise an entire demographic. You're crazy and so are *aaaaaaaall* the gays.\n\n&gt;You want to post crap saying no shit and yet you do the very thing I said you're doing. If you can comprehend the fact that idiots are responsible for their own stupid arguments then stop blaming BLM for the fact that bigots outrage and scream WLM\n\nI think you just want to pretend racist people \n suddenly organised themselves, grew in numbers, got louder, more bigotted, and more divisive by coincidence and that nothing can be done about it so fuck'em it'll probably calm down. This is fine.\n\nCan't be a bunch of dickheads hiding behind banners doing dickhead things. Especially the BLM one, everyone with that is perfect...\n\n&gt;&gt;ust because some people may be hostile doesn't mean the damn cause is the problem\n\nOOOOOOOOOH!!! Wash your potty mouth!\n\n&gt;The incompetence is unreal. I wonder how many times you'll wrongly claim strawman to cop out this time \ud83d\ude44\n\nZero.\n\n&gt;No one MADE these bigots think that way.\n\nProbably parents or something. They were pretty old, though. Just the times back them most likely.\n\n&gt;&gt;Now how do you think those two men would've behaved if I said, \"Did you not see the big fucking rainbow flag at the door? There's gay pride here and you should leave if you can't accept that.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;This is the premise of your incompetence. (Big shocker if you cop out yet again by saying I'm strawmanning for quoting your own ignorant comments)...\n&gt;\n&gt;This stupid narrative you painted in your head of hostility does not mean you can generalise an entire damn cause as being like this... you wrongly generalise BLM and gay pride.. if someone talks like that then talk to that person instead of pointing fingers at them\n\nWhat makes you connect that hypothetical with what I've said about BLM?\n\nThis narrative is an example of not responding to a bigot how you want or just not being on their level in general. Rather showing the power of connecting with them. Failure to do that often gets no where or makes things worse. Uh-doi. I even explained that.\n\nYou disagree?\n\nOf course you do. And that's why we're still here, this proving my point!\n\nWe have learned nothing except to fight about how to fix racism even thought gh you're yet to raise any points apart from fuck 'em.\n\n&gt;Jesus Christ the lack of education is unreal\n\nNo, most of this is common knowledge or logical reasoning. No need for formal education for such easy concep- oooh, I see. Nevermind ;) ;)\nDmon1Unlimited: Coward copping out to avoid replying to my points\n\n&gt;Despite saying I don't care, how do you see that as me pointing fingers of blame at the cause? I'm not even involved in that opinion lol. I am merely responding to your bombastic statement, \"gay pride triggers people so it shouldn't exist, eeeer?\" with some food for thought about opinions of the Gay Pride movement from both sides of third-parties (NOT ME) and how neither stance fit into the unrealistic simplistic way anthropology plays out in your head.\n\n\n'Both sides' my ass, you gave a shit annecdote filled with assumptions that you couldn't acknowledge you were doing multiple times.  \n\nWhat is wrong with your head? You lack basic comprehension skills. You did put blame on the movements for the fact that WLM etc exist and now like a coward you're pretending you never said anything of the sort. \n\n\n&gt;I don't know why you keep challenging this strawman thing.\n\n&gt;I won't say again, that this is not my point or opinion.\n\n&gt;Stop. Fucking. Arguing. It.\n\n&gt;Have you not noticed that at this point, the majority of what I say to you now is literally trying to steer you back on track because I don't know what the fuck you're going on about?\n\n\nOh stfu, with your strawman cop out. Yet again you cowardly use that to ignore responding my points. Its not straw man you fool \ud83d\ude44. Youre dodging and deflecting every day criticism while spewing flawed annecdotes and regurgitating \"division\" every chance you get. \n\n\n&gt;So when I say some people can be hostile and if they weren't things would be better with the BLM movement. This is different to you saying\n\n&gt;You just responded to yourself with my own point except mine goes further to say that that if this were improved there'd be more progress. But we don't want this and it's blame?! Whereas you just say, \"the damn cause is not the problem\"...for some unrelated reason. I think in your mind it's okay to have hostile people in the movement because it's still good. But in my mind it's not okay because things like hostility aren't as productive as not hostility.\n\nThe incompetence in you is unreal. The individual does not represent the fucking cause. Hostile people should be dealt with but that doesn't mean you can use them as an excuse to generalise. This is fucking rocket science.  I said this multiple times before that you can deal with the PERSON who was hostile but that doesn't mean you can tar everyone with the same brush, and yet in your incompetent brain you think I condone that because \"it's still good\".. \ud83d\ude44 several times I mentioned this and you still were too incompetent to understand \n\n&gt;That's a good point. Except I know he got a lot of praise for it and it has been ongoing debate for change to help fight against racism ever since. To be quite honest, I'm surprised you don't seem to know of it, despite your supposed passion for equality, so no common ground there, just me \"hiding\". But here's some food for thought anyway. It's good.\n\nMy god, too stupid to even comprehend what I'm saying.  You ARE hide behind these people to confirm your BS bias. Talking about people praising him doesn't change the fact that he doesn't represent all black people. \n\nCan you not fathom that just because he may not support black history month does not mean everyone else does? Calling out some BS praise still does not change that fact.\n\n&gt;It means you're refuting arguments that I am not raising without properly addressing the topic\u2014which I'm sure you have totally forgotten what is at this point. You go off counter-arguing some shit I don't even know where you get from. The funny thing is some of the time I agree with you because you're arguing at something I also think is very wrong. But then I realise it's because you thought that was what I said.\n\n\n\nLiterally I have been replying to your own stupid points and quoting you yet like a coward you keep copping out by wrongly claiming strawman just to get out of replying. The whole point here is how you're pushing a BS excuse to think both sides are to blame when it isnt. You make a stupid gay bar example to show it is both sides when it isnt. YOU made various BS assumptions like how gay pride MADE the bigots think of anything when they didn't. YOU made an example of how a hostile person could have made the situation worse, yet you incompetently conflate this with the damn cause. A person doesn't represent an entire group... what part of that does your brain to comprehend.

So why would we behave like them rather than overcome their ignorance by reaching them?\n\nStupid statement #7\n&gt;And yeah, upsetting loud-mouthed shit-for-brains people historically is not how we shut up loud-mouthed shit-for-brains people, it only makes them louder and dumber, ergo the OP article exists in our timeline now and we'll sure keep seeing more if we're to behave just as stupidly and untactfully as them\u2014again, so says endless history.\n\nStupid statement #8\n&gt;I'm not deflecting. I'm pointing fingers at both. As said, there's bigotry on both sides and that's why opportunity for progress dishearteningly doesn't get as far as it should.\n\nAnd you want to talk shit about how you're not pointing fingers?\n\nStupid statement #9\n&gt;You don't think the BLM movement is free of criticism? That's it's gone down perfectly?\n\n&gt;Okay.\n\nStupid statement #10\n&gt;Gay Pride and the \"homos in the parade\" made them think all gay people were...\n\n&gt;Nope. Not pointing fingers at the Gay Pride movement.\n\n&gt;Now how do you think those two men would've behaved if I said, \"Did you not see the big fucking rainbow flag at the door? There's gay pride here and you should leave if you can't accept that.\"\n\n&gt;Well, I'm sure they'd never have budged their bigotry.\n\nRather than acknowledge they are talking shit when they *made* them think anything you take them at face value and suggest both sides are the problem when it's only one \n\n\nVictim blaming imbecile pretends to not blame BLM while blaming them for the rise of WLM etc. \ud83d\ude44 This what the entire argument has been about. This IS blaming them  \n\nAdd this on top of all your stupid riot quotes (for which you still didn't answer my question - again can you comprehend that the BLM protests are not just riots?)... \n\nRather than just blame the bigots for their own ignorance you appease their outrage for people daring to mention the lives of their race matters. And even now as the Asian hate crimes rise, its the reason Asian lives matter also is a thing. The rise of far right extremists and the like are due to the bigots who already existed and have grown worse. This is the problem and yet you won't to push some BS both sides suck approach. They didn't suddenly exist when BLM, gay pride, Asian lives matter etc became a thing.\n\nNo one is claiming BLM is perfect, but your head is up your ass if you think it's existence (defined by race) is part of the cause of these far right dickheads.\n\nYour  annecdote is simplistic af which involves assumptions that gay pride MADE them think anything so you can point fingers while claiming you're not. It highlights your flaws for which you keep dismissing it as just a story about different views. You use this as a crap analogy for BLM. As the country turns further far right, a stupid chat isn't going to do anything. Early education will. Police reforms will. Not commemorating confederate slave traders will.

Can I just use nails? Does it need to be these crappy screws? Are the screws at fault, or it is just too cold out to do this stuff?\n\n\nEdit : Also, if there's any suggestions on removing screws from a post that broke off and have been cut flush to the wood, I would love them.\njakkarth: Use vice grip pliers to remove the broken screw. Screws will last a lot longer than nails if you can manage to get them installed. The kind of screws you want are \"decking\" or \"exterior coated\" screws. If you have trouble driving them in, use a 1/8\" drill bit to predrill the holes. Go about the length of the screw minus half an inch deep with the drill bit, then drive the screw in the hole.\n[deleted]: Yeah, no exterior coated anything. A few rust coated screws about the same size/shape that I could clean off. \n\nThe nails are left-overs from when we (my neighbors and beer) put together a patio, but I can only assume (because the neighbour got them, not us) that they were rated for outdoors.\njakkarth: If they're not coated, they'll rot/rust. That'll lead to poor structural performance (your fence falls apart) and discoloration (black stains trailing down from the screw heads). In some cases the exterior rated screws are also stronger than their interior counterparts.\n[deleted]: What i'm taking from that is \"Exterior coated nails, though inferior to exterior coated screws, are preferable to interior coated screws\"?\njakkarth: That is my recommendation, yes. I would not build a fence for my mother using anything less than exterior coated screws, but given a choice between galvanized/exterior nails and drywall/interior screws, I'd go with the nails.\n[deleted]: Thanks, your mother is a lucky lady. I'm going to grab some exterior screws later in the day, and make sure to drill in some holes before I try to install 'em.\n\nAlso, the pliers didn't work to pull out the screw, it just stripped the screw more. So I cut it off. Is that \"ok\", or are there screw-removal pliers is should look into?\njakkarth: I'd probably leave it. The [vice grip](http://tungstencarbidefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vicegrip.jpg) pliers are my go-to for removing screws with broken-off heads, so if that didn't work you're probably better off just cutting it off.

He answered that he understands, and that was it. UNTIL. \n\nAnyway, prior to this I was inviting him to join the others in group activites etc because it seemed he was always left out, maybe because he is the only guy or maybe because he's not speaking the language very well. I guess he took it as a hint of me being interested. I nevertheless very explicitly (over text) turned his date invitation down, giving my two reasons. \n\nToday he was about to be left out once again in a group assignment and was kinda just looking lost so I invited him to join our group. After this followed some pretty heavy flirting on his part. I avoided eye contact with him, turned my attention to the other group members instead, answered him only shortly etc. He continued flirting after class, asking to \"see my necklace\". I told him \"no, I don't feel comfortable with that because you'd be getting really close to me\". He apologised if what he said made me feel uncomfortable, I just told him we're good now but I just don't want that stuff.\n\nI know how to set my boundaries but I'm a bit unsure how to assert my stance to him permanently. Should I not include him next time he seems lost? Is my friendliness doomed to be an invitation in his eyes? No one else in our course does anything to include him and I feel so bad about that. It's very unnatural to me to not include people like that but I guess I have to dismiss him more since he seems to interpret me wrong every time, right? I have told him very clearly that I am just being generally friendly and he is there everyday when I treat everybody with the same niceness as him. Should I say something more to him about this? \n\nI am going to meet him like multiple times a week for the next 4 years in our tiny ass class so I can't do anything crazy. I'm so stressed out about this. \n\nTL;DR a classic story: I was friendly to a loner guy in my class, he asked me out, I turned him down, he continues flirting.

Is there any reason? Are they genuinely just overlooking him? If so, maybe they can help you with including him too. I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t unless they\u2019re purposefully excluding him, and if that\u2019s the case, there should be a good reason as to why they\u2019re excluding him. \n\nIt would be nice for everyone to put in efforts to include others, is all.\nsplashysoup: That sounds good. Our class has a good vibe in general and everybody else is included at least to the extent that no one else is left outside groups like he is.

And I agree with it.\n\nAs for the \"self-negating paradox\", I recently watched a video on reddit that explains this paradox, and the logical conclusion that if you go down the road of \"God created the universe&gt;who created God?&gt; A higher God&gt; Who created that higher God?&gt; And even higher God&gt; To infinity. \n\nThe end result is an infinite God, one that simply always is, was and will be; and the only proof of its existence is that anything exists at all.\ntaoistchainsaw: But that is just one answer to the question, and because there is no way to test it, it can be negated by any other answer. \n     For example, all of these answers are exactly as correct as the infinite gods answer:\n     1. The universe is resting on the back of an enormous meta-turtle, floating in the seas of Everlore. \n      2. The universe was created by a somewhat powerful god, but that god is just a middle management God, and he reports to a member only slightly higher the him in the Dei-ocracy. \n       3. The universe is a collection of physical and chemical laws, with no grand creator, and edged by literal nothing, and everything since the last bang in the big-bang cycle, has obeyed the laws we recognize now, and has causally followed from their implementation. \n      I could go on in adfinitum \nChewyman11: All of your responses though do not denote an end point.

{"full_text": "pattysmife: How not to warm up.\nMy apologies if this was linked before, but I thought this was a good article from T-nation that made some very good points.\n\nhttp://www.t-nation.com/article/most_recent/how_not_to_warm_up\n\nSpecifically, the article questions not only the safety but the \"effectiveness\" of the superman hold and many of its variations.  Many spinal twists are also criticized.  If anyone has read the book that the article cites [Facts and Fallacies of Fitness by Mel Siff](http://www.amazon.com/Facts-and-Fallacies-of-Fitness/dp/B00065X0RO), not exactly a big seller, I'd be curious to know more!\n\n\nGoGoGoemon: *Facts and Fallacies* is a fun read, although quite ooold by now! ;) Generally if Mel Siff wrote it, read it! However, although there's still a whole lot of wisdom to be found in *Facts and Fallacies*, it's written in a time when aerobic classes still were THE thing. So, you might be better advised to invest into *Supertraining*, which is still kind of a gold standard, but this one too sadly isn't getting updated anymore.. \n\nGenerally the literature (e.g. good ol' Shirley Sahrmann) cited in that article, which itself isn't that recent, is getting slowly old and maybe even somewhat outdated.\n\nYou've tapped into a huge problem of what rehab literature says is safe movement and what is actually being trained at many places. The stuff on this sub is for the greater part still pretty much on the safer side (to my limited knowledge), if you ignore the shitty \"ab routines\" people come up with, and luckily often get booed off for. \n\nHowever, arch holds/supermans are an utter shit exercise for your back according to Stu McGill. He has EMG research done on them and other back exercises, showing that arch holds create the highest compressive forces on the spine of all back exercises tested, hyperextensions rank, not even close, at a second (still also qualify as a shitty exercise according to McGill). Consequently he says they should better be discarded off just like s(h)it-ups and crunches. But then, maybe it's at least questionable if 3x a week of 60s in that position will actually wreck your spine?? I'm also not completely sure what form they were performed in. I'm pretty sure that you'd get quite different readings doing them with a heavy lumbar arch and hyperextended neck cramping like stupid and recruiting all the force from the low back, or extending from the glutes and thoracic spine with a \"packed\" neck. \"EMG doesn't lie, but doesn't tell the whole truth either\" as Charlie Weingroff likes to say (anyone else seeing the resemblance to Bubbles, btw?).\n\nBut it gets much more complicated if you take a look at what's being taught at gymnasticsbodies for example (/r/flexibility too taps deeper into that confusion, btw). Just off the top of my head, arch body holds/rocks, hyperextensions, circular twisting hyperextensions (both done with a hyperextended neck too), up to full bodyweight Jefferson curls, straddle and v-ups probably too, heavy weighted shoulder dislocations (ironically the potential injury is right there in the name of the exercise, food for thought maybe?) - I've seen all of this mentioned by credible researchers as exact mechanisms of serious injury. Compared to that the stuff in the article seems quite harmless.\n\nSo, now what? I don't know, I'm not a professional and I don't have an answer. I think it's worth mentioning though that gymnastics hasn't exactly a great track record if it comes to wrecked shoulders and backs in particular, but they also do a lot of the above movement patterns very explosively leading to high impact forces on the joints. There's certainly a difference to the static stuff what most of us here do. On the other side, I think it's also worth taking into account that many of those researchers work as health care providers, they don't necessarily get to see too many healthy joints, also there are surprisingly many who don't train in any meaningful degree. This, too, matters somewhat, I think.\n\nI do this \"recreationally\", so my personal approach with potentially riskier skills is that I ask myself if I really need or want to learn them, if it's worth taking a risk. If yes, I try to do it smartly or more precisely what I *think* is smartly. I try to keep intensity, frequency and load low, so that my body hopefully has enough time to recover from any potential wear and tear in between sessions. The majority of my training then is done in \"safe\" positions, neutral spine, packed neck, packed shoulders etc.   \npattysmife: Time to Reddit creep this guy for other posts of high quality.\nGoGoGoemon: Haha, thanks!

For instance, the superman hold, which is often touted as a great way to engage the core and improve posture, can actually put unnecessary pressure on the spine and lead to discomfort or even injury. Similarly, spinal twists can cause excessive rotation and strain on the vertebrae, which can be damaging in the long run.\n\nIt's fascinating to see how certain exercises have become ingrained in our fitness culture, without being subjected to scrutiny or evidence-based analysis.

Chestflys are also great for lower pec isolation but they are uncomfertable for me.

And your question about if this is hitting majority of major muscle groups yes i thinkso but lmk what you think i could improve because there's always room to improve. You could mess with sets and reps to fit your needs, swap high volume pullups for rows but tbh i really do think if you keep it simple and just get insanely strong at the upper callithenics compound movements and make every rep count you'll uncover alot of your genetic potential if you're consistent\nanonymoose-moose02: Mate really appreciate the help.

{"full_text": "Captain_Nachos: How to Handstand Pt 2 - Chest to Wall Handstands; Including Form Tips + How to Enter/Exit safely!\nHey guys, part 2 of this handstand tutorial series is out, this time its on chest to wall handstands.\n\n\n**LINK TO VIDEO HERE:** https://youtu.be/fOy7sE1_vI0\n\n\n\n**The Chest to Wall Handstand**\n\nChest to Wall Handstands are a super important progression and tool for your handstand training. They are the first progression (including their slightly scaled down cousin, the Wall Plank as shown in the video) of the handstand that actually involves being in a handstand, and of all the progressions for the handstand this one is the most important for helping you transfer that 'bodyline straightness' into an upside down, 'there's so much blood in my head and I can't breathe' style position.\n\nBecause of that, it's important to note that the Chest to Wall handstand is not just a progression that you can 'master' and them dump on the side of the road like an old shoe. Firstly, along with some 'back to wall' training and obviously, freestanding training, the chest to wall is going to be a tool in your handbalancing arsenal long after you achieve a freestanding handstand because of how it can help improve your bodyline, as it allows you to isolate away the balancing aspect and does not cause excessive lumbar arching like the back-to-wall.\n\nAs you can see in the video, my form is not yet perfect on the chest to wall handstand due to mobility limitations, yet I can hold a freestanding handstand to the best form that my mobility will allow for 45 seconds at best and 30 seconds on average. \n\nJust because I can handstand free of a wall doesn't mean I SHOULD ONLY do that. Chest to Wall handstands should be used in your training all the way up to the point you have a PERFECTLY straight freestanding handstand, and even then they should be used at the very least as a warm-up set before your freestanding practice.\n\n**Form Tip Reminders, From the Bottom Up:**\n\n* As always, cambered hands.\n\n* Arms locked straight\n\n* Shoulders shrugged up to your ears\n\n* Chest pushed toward the wall, to open the shoulder angle\n\n* Contract your Abs to flatten your ribs down to the best of your ability\n\n* Posteriorly Tilt your Pelvis to get as flat a lower back as possible (It may help to squeeze yo' booty muscles/glutes)\n\n* Squeeze your legs together very hard, so if someone were to walk up and try to pull your legs apart (very good partner drill, in fact) they would not be able to\n\n* Lock your legs straight\n\n* Point your toes\n\n**Other Things:**\n\nKeeping up with these videos weekly has been a bit of a fun struggle as I'm currently doing exams but hopefully I'll be set to release part 3 same day next week, which is either going to be on back-to-wall handstand training and how its good and why its also not good sometimes, or on toe/heel pull drills for balancing the handstand.\n\nI'm also working on some wrist flexibility/strengthening article (+ maybe video) so that might come out this week or next week to go along with the handstand training but who knows with my schedule at the mo'.\n\nIf anyone missed part 1, it's on the Hollow Body Hold and you can watch it **here**: [Hollow Hold Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n07aKcHZlkY)\n\nHope you guys like this series! If you have any extra tips or critiques or ways I could improve the series I'd definitely appreciate hearing them!\n\nIf you have any requests for things to go in this series or in another tutorial I'm always hungry for new video ideas, so go for it!\n\nThanks,\n\nNick-E\nprofuseflyingfish: What do you mean by cambered hands? \n\nThanks for the tips btw! \nCaptain_Nachos: Cambered hands mean you are digging your fingers into the ground like claws. Instead of having your fingers flat you have your middle knuckle of each finger slightly raised off the floor which gives you more purchase and pushing force against the ground which is good practice once you move to freestanding as it will be one of the main methods of balancing.\nAlexanderEgebak: Is there really a benefit to cambered hands? The more you \"camber\" the less contact you will have to the surface. If you have normal finger strength I believe the cambering and less contact with the floor will even out your handstand potential.\nCaptain_Nachos: It allows you to push harder with your fingers. Your palms will stay flat on the floor. Having your fingers flat massively reduces your ability to use your fingers to correct an over-balance. Not having your middle knuckle on the floor, at least in my experience has not reduced my ability to balance at all, especially considering the weight should be on the ball of your hand, not directly on your fingers\nAlexanderEgebak: Splaying your fingers will give a larger surface of contact. I am speculating whether or not splayed fingers position is easier to rebalance from than cambered. I guess that may vary according to the relative finger strength and hand/wrist proportions. I have not heard any conclusive evidence that cambered hands are the strongest position for the handstand.\n\nBeing a former volleyball player myself I have plenty of finger strength and do planche leans with cambered handstands, however not handstands.\n", "prompt": "Captain_Nachos: How to Handstand Pt 2 - Chest to Wall Handstands; Including Form Tips + How to Enter/Exit safely!\nHey guys, part 2 of this handstand tutorial series is out, this time its on chest to wall handstands.\n\n\n**LINK TO VIDEO HERE:** https://youtu.be/fOy7sE1_vI0\n\n\n\n**The Chest to Wall Handstand**\n\nChest to Wall Handstands are a super important progression and tool for your handstand training.

 or where?  when someone is asleep and dreaming, does their dream exist within their everyday world or are they transcending the normal concept of reality?\nkazanshin: although dreams do exist within someones everyday world i think that they transcend the normal concept of reality. this is where i think it will get really crazy. phenomenologically, dreams occur temporally and spatially beyond our outside world. although they are informed by the-world-at-large they occur outside of it. they can certainly be marked historically but there remains a spatial and temporal disconnect from the waking state. \neyedonegoofed: ah!  now we're getting somewhere.  the point i want to explore is Heidegger's assertion that we exist only within the world.  there are a few experiences that transcend the world beyond its average everydayness.  if we can agree that this is possible, that dreams function as a jump beyond the mineness of dasein, we can explore the implications of there being consciousness beyond everyday reality.  do uncontrolled authentic attributes of dasein (death, dreaming, etc) hint at our being in the world, or transcending the world?\nkazanshin: i think that these mentioned uncontrolled authentic attributes of dasein hint at us transcending the world. however, they are necessitated by our being-in-the-world since as far as we know we couldnt have them otherwise. theres an undeniable link between the two. maybe thats why heidegger is saying that we exist only within the world. maybe dreams can be thought of as a projection emanating from the world that we can exist within while remaining in the world-at-large. something that could be really interesting though would be to look at what kant says about transcendental experiences and try to explain those in terms of heideggers phenomenology. \n", "prompt": "eyedonegoofed: How do Dreams fit into Heidegger's Being-In-The-World?\ndreams are not a part of reality, they aren't \"in-the-world\" yet they are inherent in Dasein.  what's the deal?\nkazanshin: even though dreams aren't in-the-world they're inherent in dasein because it's being-towards-something. i think that they would be inherent in dasein because one of the major aspects of dasein is being-towardsness. one example of being-towardsness is handy-ness and an even better example of being-towards", "orig": "ness is dasein's de-severance of remoteness\neyedonegoofed: i agree with you but would like to make a distinction.  the act of dreaming seems to be an existentiale, a necessary facet of existence.  i wouldn't even constrict it to dasein, as other animals have shown signs of dreaming.  but when one is inside the dream, reality falls away.  mineness is no longer mine, and the dream's reality takes hold.  we can agree that dreaming results from our thrownness into this world, but can we consider the actions inside the dream world a", "generated": "...\n\nIt seems that kazanshin has provided a compelling explanation for why dreams are inherent in Dasein, despite not being part of the external world.

{"full_text": "jericho2291: The brain and intelligence.\nSo a few weeks ago I watched the movie \"Waking Life\" and one lecture about our \"sense of self\" has been on my mind ever since.  I can't quote the movie directly, but the discussion is mainly about an amoeba's \"sense of self\" as compared to ours.  An amoeba is a single celled organism, so it's \"self\" is just this single cell.  Humans on the other hand are many billions of cells in a single colony, so our \"self\" is vastly different from an amoeba's.\n\nSkip ahead a week and I'm reading a lot about artificial intelligence and the human brain.  I began thinking about the hive mind behavior of ants and other social insects and the concept of [swarm intelligence](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Swarm_intelligence).  Swarm Intelligence is basically a collection of individuals following simple rules with no centralized structure, which leads to the emergence of intelligent global behavior completely unknown to the individuals in the collection.  \n\nBack to the amoeba quote from waking life, I began thinking about our brain behavior.  Are there any theories suggesting that our brain follows a similar \"swarm intelligence\" behavior?  Perhaps each of our neurons/cells behave independently of one another, the product of which is our consciousness, intelligence, and self-awareness?  Perhaps this behavior can easily be simulated using simple laws and a cluster of individuals, giving rise to complex artificial intelligence.\ntreelovinhippie: This is exactly what I think consciousness is... merely an emergent phenomena from \"collective behaviour\". It's a bit like how ants can build a wonderfully complex ant hill with air vents and giant structure, but no individual ant is aware of what they've built, and there is no central control.\n\nAnother example is water. Individually, H2O molecules are not \"wet\". But as a collective, the \"wetness\" property is emergent.\n\nHumans are doing the same thing now as ants IMO. Our global economy and the Internet are emergent and already so sophisticated that no individual or group of individuals could begin to fathom what we've created. And I'm hoping the emergent property of the Internet will be conscious AI.\n[deleted]: &gt;I'm hoping the emergent property of the Internet will be conscious AI.\n\nThat's a very very very long shot\ntreelovinhippie: How?... it already behaves much like a brain. Think of it as an organism.\n[deleted]: Same thing you can say about sub atomic particles, ants, city arrangements. Just because uncoordinated actions can lead to intelligent behavior it doesn't mean it will be conscious.   And i doesn't behaves like the brain, at all.\ntreelovinhippie: &gt; Just because cause uncoordinated actions can lead to intelligent behavior it doesn't mean it will be conscious.\n\nYou could say that about the human brain now. It comes down to whether you think consciousness is an emergent property from the interactions of neurons or if something mystical or quantum is happening.\n\nAlso think of each computer on the Internet as a neuron. Or imagine you're an extraterrestrial looking at what we primitive human creatures have made. Really the Internet is just a network with flowing electrical pulses in a structure very similar to a brain.\n[deleted]: I read a paper about emergent behavior a long time ago, I don't remember the guy's name. I do remember that the uncoordinated actions have some sort of feedback with the environment and they have rules of interactions. The \"intelligent\" behavior is a reflection of those rules.\n\nThe reason why I said is a long shot it is because, the rules of interaction are different in the brain and in the Internet. So far, we have only encountered one thing capable of creating consciousness and that's our brain. Since, the rules of interaction between neurons is different than the rules of interaction between terminals, then brain has a different emergent behavior than the Internet. \n\nAlso, emergence only explains why some things exhibit intelligent behavior. It does not guarantee that such behavior will happen and whoever came up with it had a pretty loose definition of \"intelligent behavior\".\n\n\n\nTuril: We can't even define consciousness in any way that even the experts agree on, so there's no way we can ever accurately say that humans are the only ones with consciousness. :-)\n", "prompt": "jericho2291: The brain and intelligence.\nSo a few weeks ago I watched the movie \"Waking Life\" and one lecture about our \"sense of self\" has been on my mind ever since.  I can't quote the movie directly, but the discussion is mainly about an amoeba's \"sense of self\" as compared to ours.  An amoeba is a single celled organism, so it's \"self\" is just this single cell.  Humans on the other hand are many billions of cells in a single colony, so our \"self\" is vastly different from an amoeba's.\n\nSkip ahead a week", "orig": "and I'm reading a lot about artificial intelligence and the human brain.  I began thinking about the hive mind behavior of ants and other social insects and the concept of [swarm intelligence](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Swarm_intelligence).  Swarm Intelligence is basically a collection of individuals following simple rules with no centralized structure, which leads to the emergence of intelligent global behavior completely unknown to the individuals in the collection.  \n\nBack to the amoeba quote from waking life, I began thinking about our brain behavior.  Are there any theories suggesting that our brain follows a similar \"swarm intelligence\" behavior?  Perhaps", "generated": ", and I found myself pondering this concept even more. I started to wonder, if our sense of self is made up of billions of cells working together, then what exactly is intelligence? Is it a product of individual cells or is it an emergent property of the collective? Do our brain cells, which are essentially just cells like any others in our body, have their own sense of self, or are they simply programmable units that follow instructions to create our conscious experience?\n\nThis line of thinking led me to consider the nature of artificial intelligence. Are AI systems, which are made up of complex algorithms and processing units, capable of having"}

Which is really stupid because I don't think I know anything about anyone in the class, at least not on a personal level. I am positive they know nothing of me, unless they want to talk about how mean I use to be... but I don't really want that.\n\nThe teacher told us to think about what truths and lie to tell, I was going to be sarcastic and write down \"My favorite color is orange, my second favorite color is blue, and my third favorite color is pink\" or something stupid like that. But he said not to write something stupid like that.\n\nThe class is HUGE. There wasn't even enough seats around for people to sit in. So hopefully they don't get to me, but I am sure we'll be playing this dumb game until Friday.\n\nTips on anything would be helpful here\nseryue: i find that taking deep breaths beforehand and periodically reminding myself to pause and talk at a moderate pace helps a ton!\n\nPractice reciting exactly what you want to say to yourself, it can help not going in blind even if you know your general idea of the truths and one lie\n\nIf making eye contact worries you it can help to just focus on the space of nose between their eyes or on their eyebrows ! Generally no one notices the difference, good luck!\nRosemaryKitty: Thank you! Making eye contact sometimes worries me, but I guess it just depends on who I'm looking at. But thanks! I will just look at noses hehe\n\nWhen talking, how can I keep a good tone, like, speaking clear and not speaking nervously or quietly? \nseryue: I still have this problem myself actually! Controlling my voice is one of the things I\u2019m still trying to improve. So far I\u2019ve found that nervous speaking is deterred by a slow and steady pace, making sure to take breaths in between sentences ! It\u2019s better to be a bit slow than to be too fast after all, I\u2019ve been told people sometimes struggle to keep up with me lol\nThis also applies to volume, if you\u2019re afraid that a large group of people can\u2019t hear you don\u2019t be afraid to go a little louder, chances are that you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re shouting but it\u2019s because your own ears are the closest pair to your voice \n\nSometimes i find that my voice shakes when i speak and it\u2019s definitely very hard to control. It sounds repetitive but steady breathing helps a lot! I\u2019ve even heard professional speakers\u2019 voice shake in front of crowds at school, definitely do not feel bad if it happens to you because even the pros get it sometimes!\n\nAnother tactic i found was useful is to pretend like you\u2019re acting as someone else, smile even if you feel scared and act like you know what you\u2019re doing even if you don\u2019t. No one else can tell your fake confidence from your real confidence ! \u201cFake it till you make it\u201d has become my new motto for speaking in front of crowds. Similarly i also keep  in mind the phrase \u201cif you act like you know what you\u2019re doing, no one will question you\u201d. I\u2019ve found it helps me put on that \u201calter ego\u201d act a little better. Also! Remembering that people usually tend to pay more attention to themselves than to others is useful, an embarrassing voice crack that you remember forever is something everyone else will surely forget within five minutes so don\u2019t worry!

Trying to make it an eye catcher?\n\nJust remember that anyone looking at the head will be staring into the light which may make it less appealing to look at rather than more appealing if you end up putting it on the front like your image shows.\n\nNow, if you are going the route of lighting the object, then you need to use some sort of directed light that is at least partly shielded from the person viewing it (so they don't look like a deer in headlights either).\n\nIf you are going decoration aspect, consider NOT putting it on the front.

You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.  Mine cuts very quickly and etches very well.  Here is an edge lit sign to get an idea:\nhttp://www.valleydesignsnd.com/catalog/images/products/ac10212015_2.jpg\n\nAnother option to look at is tossing the LED thing and looking at EL wire.  Its very flexible, easy to work with and isn't extremely intense like LED is.  Is more of a subtle but distinctive look.  Doesn't put out much light so won't do anything for lighting up your head.  But for eyecandy effects, its hard to discount.  Its soft and flexible enough to be woven into clothes and has been used in halloween costumes for quite a few years now.

Having the back of the plague is an option I considered, but I wanted to focus the light on the head than rather on the plague.

It's also easier to hang. On the down side it might not provide enough distance between the bars depending on what you hang it against.

While you have faith in preachers who sold you miracles, prophecies, prayer, creation, heaven and hell, absolute morality, virgin births, resurrections, scapegoating for 10% on your earnings and who demand you never test it. And you have no means to demonstrate any of those to me.\nBiker93: None of those things have to do with morality .\nbitee1: A literal Adam and Eve as said in the bible are proven false by evolution, common sense of incest and genetics. Talking snakes are proven false by basic anatomy. The entire story is based on that literal - original sin.  There was no \"original sin\". Without that there was no need for Jesus. The biblical age of the earth is proven false by many dating systems - radioactivity  and carbon, including the speed of light. The Exodus story left no evidence, the Egyptians did not use slaves to build the pyramids. The Egyptians recorded things even that were unflattering and there was no mention of 2 million Jews leaving in their records or the 10 plagues as bible described. The 2 million Jews traveling about 1000 miles over 40 years left no evidence. It took about 6 months to a year and a half to cross the U.S. by wagon - 2000 miles. \"Going\" with god doesn't seem to get you very far.\nNoah's ark was copied from other flood stories, millions of land animals could not have fit on any boat for half a year, then repopulated the earth again - incest and genetics. There is not enough water to cover all the mountains - 5 miles high. All the fish would have died. Before the 10 commandments was Hammurabi's code. \nThere is still pain in childbirth, Jesus did not fix that- so we had to. Jesus allegedly paid for the original sin but no changes to the punishments of it were made Genesis 3:16. Many parts of the Jesus story and Christian traditions were taken from other religions including- attributes of Jesus that were taken from other gods personified, Christmas and Easter - are stolen pagan holidays.  No known bible (and unforged) author claimed to have seen Jesus. The gospels were not written by known authors. The Jesus story was not documented at all outside of the bible during or near his life, the gospel stories were written 30-80 years after Jesus would have died. There was not a census then, nor a documented slaughter of innocents. Jesus was a false prophet (he did not fulfill the OT prophecies, he made prophecies that did not happen), and that is just part of why there are still Jews. OT Prophecies were made up in the NT just to say that Jesus filled them. Jesus has a lineage to people who never existed as written. The people in the bible's later books like Jesus saw the bible base stories as literal.\nThere never was anything called sin, it is made up to sell you an imaginary cure. \nThere are only crimes against humanity and others - religion is one of the worst. People still hate, kill and torture others and they use their religion to excuse it. All the people that have faith believe in is nothing more than imaginary evidence and it is based on empty claims from other deluded people. Any god can not be tested or replicated in any method. It is not provably based in reality and the burden of proof is on the one who claims it exists. You can not have faith and evidence. If everything needs a creator so does god and you know man made thousands of them out of fear and ignorance. Yours is not a special case just because you were born in the \"right\" country and the \"right\" family to find that exact version of your god. Religious \"convictions\" are based on geography and family history very rarely do people find a god that does not fit those two criteria. 80-90% of Christians have not read all of the bible, and that is the best book someone can read to become an atheist. But that is why credulous people have faith, so they don't need evidence or facts.  Without empirical evidence for the bible god - the Jesus story means absolutely nothing. Belief in book claimed miracles based in hearsay by unknown authors is a denial of reality.\nBiker93: You\u2019re proving my point, this entire rant has nothing to do with the question I asked you proving you are not an honest player here.  Every biblical example you used involved predatory, opportunistic interpretation again proving you\u2019re not an honest player here. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, you have the biblical literacy of snake handlers.  You have the scientific literacy of a 14 year old who\u2019s watched NOVA a couple times.  Example, you claim with authority you know the age of the earth.  You use that as a tool to prove the Bible is wrong.  You then go on to say we know the age of the earth because of carbon dating.  That is nonsense, carbon dating has nothing to do with the age of the earth.  You assume an authority you don\u2019t have or deserve, use tools like science which you don\u2019t understand to disprove the Bible which you also don\u2019t understand.  Also known as a bigot.\n\nAnd people don\u2019t need religion to be horrible to each other.  If anything it\u2019s a restraining influence.  Just look at what happened when Atheists got ahold of power.  In just a few regions in the 20th century alone 150M+ people were murdered at the hands of atheist socialists.  To ignore that\u2019s just proves my point you are a bigot.\nbitee1: Religious beliefs are being constantly forced on others with indoctrination, religious based laws and incessant preaching through media. If believers could completely keep it to themselves, it seems realistic that we would then not care near as much about religion. If there was a way to get through to believers using logic and reason, I would gladly do that instead of primarily mocking faith based ideas. It is the religious moderates who are especially harmful by being the majority who are protecting, enabling and validating the beliefs used for religious harm, even though the moderates do not really think the books have a literal meaning.\n\nTelling people to have faith trains people to accept ideas that are not based on reality. Faith tells believers that just accepting people for their word is a great and noble thing. These things that require faith have no known basis on reality. Just believing everyone or a holy book that does not have supporting evidence for any reason is not a virtue. It is training people to be gullible and setting them up to be easily manipulated. These things that require faith very often contradict scientific facts. These things that require faith many times are harmful like not using condoms because \"they are evil\" it is just a means to propagate the religion at the great expense of the believers.\n\nThere is no debate here, as you love faith and what can only be called by honest people fairy tales. If you had simple logic skills and were allowed to honestly question your religious beliefs you would not have them.\n\nThere is no god that just watches as children are abused and starve to death that is worthy of worship except from cowards, liars the greatly deluded and other psychopathic personalities.\n", "prompt": "herjall: A tree literally older than Jesus\n\nWhirrBuzzer: The tree isn't fictional.\nManJpeg: Religion bad!!1! &gt;:(\nbitee1: It is the religious moderate majority who play a very important role in protecting, enabling and validating the harmful beliefs of the fundamentalists - by this fact they are indirectly harming others.

{"full_text": "Snow_Mandalorian: Animal Pain, the Turing Test, and human pleasure: ethical dilemmas outside the classroom.\n\nShalmaneserIII: I'd suspect it all comes down to hedonism. For some, the pain caused by animal suffering outweighs the pleasure of eating the dead animals. For others, the pleasure of eating the beasts is greater. \nUmamiSalami: Others might judge the pleasure to be greater, but [simple math](http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods) shows that this idea is very probably wrong.\nShalmaneserIII: No, no, not the general pleasure- the personal pleasure the individual receives from eating meat, or the displeasure at the knowledge of animal suffering. \nUmamiSalami: Well, that's egoist hedonism pretty much. It's not a common moral position, especially among those who choose vegetarianism.\nShalmaneserIII: Survey the various comments from meat eaters, and see if they don't tend to reduce to \"I like eating meat, and don't care so much about animal suffering/death\". \n\n\n\nVegetarianism or meat-eating may just boil down to what moral framework you happen to have, then. \nphobophilophobia: Saying \"I don't care\" is hardly a philosophical argument. It's tantamount to sticking your fingers in your ears and screaming \"LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!' \n\nEither that, or they are a sociopath and shouldn't be a trusted source of moral reasoning. \n\nIt's a non-argument and should be ignored by thinking people.\nShalmaneserIII: Not \"I don't care\", but \"This pleasure is worth that suffering\". \nphobophilophobia: Well, the animal rights movement has its roots in utilitarianism. Anyone who thinks that a trivial pleasure negates the immense suffering caused by industrial farming practices is being extremely myopic.\nShalmaneserIII: Pleasure...to humans. Suffering...to nonhumans. We refrain from harm to other human beings for different reasons than we refrain from harm to animals.\n\n\n\nFor example, if someone said they'd eaten bacon every morning for forty years would you react to them more negatively than someone who said that, once, they killed and ate a human infant?\nphobophilophobia: If you lived 200 years ago, how would you react to someone who wore clothing made from slave-picked cotton? Chances are you'd shrug it off, just like people today shrug off eating animal products. Note that I'm not trying to equate slavery and industrial farming, but drawing an analogy.\n\nThis notion that human beings deserve moral consideration and animals do not, or for some reason deserve less, is an example of what Peter Singer calls \"speciesism.\" The fact is that we just ignore our moral responsibilities to non-human animals out of convenience. But, if you were to actually let yourself fully comprehend the suffering that animals go through in order for you to have your bacon, and you actually thought about the moral implications of your feelings, you may come to see that it is wrong to cause another being to live a miserable life so that you can enjoy the taste of its flesh.\nShalmaneserIII: No, having seen factory farming, having a pretty good understanding of how smart and personality-filled pigs are, still going with bacon at breakfast. It's not because I fail to comprehend the suffering of the pig- and frankly, I'm fine with minimizing it as long as it doesn't interfere with eating him- it's because my own displeasure at not eating the animal would be greater than my displeasure at the suffering the animal receives. \n\n\n\nAnd forget 200 years ago- much chocolate is harvested by child slave labor. How do I react to someone who eats chocolate?\nphobophilophobia: It seems that your only concern is *your* pleasure and *your* displeasure. I fall to see how you can justify that on any philosophical basis whatsoever.\n\nI don't eat chocolate that isn't fair trade for that very reason, by the way. I'm absolutely appalled that child slavery is still so widespread. The fact that you're so apathetic about injustice makes me wonder why you're browsing /r/philosophy.\nShalmaneserIII: As mentioned elsewhere, egoistic hedonism. Which works *in cooperation* with others to ensure, protect, and enhance my happiness by respecting and encouraging theirs. Professing a morality is essentially making an offer to others to behave in a mutually beneficial way with them. \n\n\n\nAnd here's where the pig loses out- he can't help me be happier in any better way than by being bacon. In broad terms, this works with humans, too- a human being who has indicated he has no ability to help or even observe my happiness falls outside the framework of morality entirely. So I would put the psychopath in a cage for the rest of his life, or harm the violent attacker to get him to stop- so that my pleasure and those who are capable of sharing that \"morality\" is preserved and safeguarded. \nphobophilophobia: Have you heard of Franz deWaal? He's done some interesting research into the evolution of morality. Part of what he discovered is that being empathetic is hedonistic. You derive pleasure from treating other beings with compassion and fairness whether they can help you or not. This means that moral systems that value altruism are actually egotistical in their own right. What normally is presented as hedonistic egoism is nothing more than materialism and selfishness. It is driven by a truncated, myopic view of self-interest. It is ignorant at its best, and sociopathic at its worst.\nShalmaneserIII: Well, no, I don't think it can be generalized that you derive pleasure from treating other beings with compassion and fairness regardless of reciprocity. That'll be true for some people and not others, and true in some cases and not others. \n\n\n\nBoth altruism and selfishness promote happiness...*to a point*. Some mix of these will result in the optimal happiness for the individual. So, don't torture the pig to death if you can reasonably avoid it...but if bacon brings you joy, eat the pig. \nphobophilophobia: I suggest you look into his research. \n\nSomeone who doesn't find compassion pleasurable has a neurological problem. People who are unable to feel good about compassion may suffer from antisocial personality disorder. It's also common for people in the autism spectrum to have trouble empathizing. But, other than that, it is a normal characteristic of healthy human beings.\n\nYes, there is always a balance to be made, but in this case, you're still disregarding the pig's needs to satisfy your wants. If you were empathetic to the pig at all you wouldn't put your wants over its needs.\nShalmaneserIII: &gt;  If you were empathetic to the pig at all you wouldn't put your wants over its needs.\n\nI disagree with that. This may be taking things a step further than you stated, but you seem to be saying that you cannot both cause something to suffer, enjoy the consequences of that suffering, and still empathize with its suffering? Humans- normal humans- are capable of holding contradictory positions indefinitely because it promotes their own psychological good or prevents greater dissonance. \nphobophilophobia: I'm aware of the fact that humans can contradict themselves, but am of the opinion that it should be avoided as much as possible. Crocodile tears don't impress me. People other to be morally consistent.\nShalmaneserIII: I'd say moral consistency might wind up being quite a bad thing. You might insist that human suffering and animal suffering are equivalent...right up until you suggest killing a human or letting one die to save a sufficient number of chickens. \n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, assume that people *are* morally consistent, but their morality actually is egostic hedonism- they'll do whatever makes them feel best. Sometimes that'll be acting in an altruistic fashion, sometimes it'll be selfishness. This, to me, is the best explanation of how people actually behave- they maximize their own pleasure and minimize their pain as best they know how.\nphobophilophobia: But how people behave changes over time and we have an obligation to question whether or not a typical behavior is right or wrong. \nShalmaneserIII: No, the \"right/wrong\" answer's pretty easy. Trouble is, there are multiple systems for determining the answer, some of which generate opposite results. Unless you have a good way of picking a moral system *without using a moral system to do so*, we hit an impasse. \n", "prompt": "Snow_Mandalorian: Animal Pain, the Turing Test, and human pleasure: ethical dilemmas outside the classroom.\n\nShalmaneserIII: I'd suspect it all comes down to hedonism.

The math presented by UmamiSalami highlights the stark reality of animal suffering, which is often overlooked or downplayed in favor of satisfying human cravings. This raises questions about the true cost of our food choices and whether our pleasure-driven decisions are, in fact, morally justifiable.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of hedonism extends beyond the realm of food and into other areas of human pleasure. For instance, the production of luxury goods, such as fur and leather, also involves significant animal suffering. Similarly, the entertainment industry"}

The story portrays it like college was out of the question because of money, but i know tons of people who who couldn't afford college so they took out loans. Also a poor girl with stellar grades from the ghetto would be a prime candidate for financial aid. Another story ran on NPR the other day about how poor high acheivers should always aim for the best schools they can because their chances of getting financial aid are very good, and their earnings potential after graduation will be much higher so they can pay off any loans they have. The story centered around a Hispanic girl from the middle of nowhere who was very poor but a high acheiver in school, and she applied and was accepted to Dartmouth with financial aid so she only had to pay 5,000$ per year. The girl Melanie in this story was in the same boat, but i feel her bad attitude was what stopped her ultimately. \nProfessorRiffs: Maybe she's smart enough to not take out student loans?\nnotgod: Sometimes you have to take some risks. If a person knows what they want to do before college age, then go for it. Pour your heart and soul into your \"thing\" that you found to value so much, without the loans. But for the rest of us, we have the option to taking out the loans to expand our capabilities and maybe figure something else out what we want to do. There's always the option of not taking out loans when you don't have a \"thing\" but it will be more difficult to climb the economic ladder. That's almost assuming your goal is to climb the ladder, you are entirely entitled to not - you can stay exactly where you are or drop down a few rungs if you choose to not climb. \nOriginalStomper: &gt;Sometimes you have to take some risks.\n\nAgreed.  But the risks are disproportionately greater and more intimidating when you are a poor person of color with more chance the risk will not pay off and NO financial safety net.\nnotgod: If you're already poor and no way to pay it off - what is there to lose making an attempt? \nOriginalStomper: When you are poor with no credit, not paying your bills means getting evicted.  Not paying bills is serious.  The underprivileged know that the system works against them -- why should they believe they can take on debt with no adverse consequences?  How would they know?\nnotgod: Because then you're stuck in the same spot for the rest of your life. Pay the important bills, work with the billing company to get into a payment plan, get your shit turned off. Otherwise you're stuck. I'd rather try and fail then just spend my life doing the same thing. Read some biographies of people that have made it, they went for broke and succeeded by taking chances. Society wants you to keep paying your bills, fall in line, be average. If you're fine with that, good, if not, otherwise start making some changes and take some risks.

Furthermore, it does not seem plausible that people with a capacity for empathy would, on the basis of meta-ethical arguments, voluntarily and knowingly attempt to reduce their empathy by [desensitizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_%28psychology%29) themselves to the suffering of others.\n\nIn conclusion, meta-ethical arguments (with the possible exception of arguments dealing with the nature of freedom and its significance for moral responsibility) cannot affect one\u2019s practical ethical decision-making processes any more than arguments in the philosophy of mathematics. If meta-ethical arguments can have any effect at all on one\u2019s decision-making in ethical matters, it is by helping one to think about how to consistently and correctly apply one\u2019s ethical positions (as described above).\nslickwombat: What those \"some theorists\" are saying, presumably, is that one needs a good metaethical theory to ground one's normative ethical theory, and that applied ethics in turn should consist of putting our normative theory into practice.\n\nYou are proposing an idea of how people *do in fact* go about making ethical judgements, and saying that metaethics isn't involved. Whether or not your psychological account is correct is irrelevant. Nobody is claiming that people typically sit down and work out a metaethical theory before deciding on moral matters, even on an informal level. They are talking about how moral decisions *should*, rationally, be done. \nDavid_Robert: I am proposing that moral decisions can't be done in any other way than the one that I described. Thus, it seems futile to argue that moral decisions *should* be done in some other way.\nslickwombat: I'm not following then. Why is it that moral decisions *cannot* be informed by moral philosophy?\nDavid_Robert: I believe that meta-ethical arguments are useful for decision-making only in so far as they can (very indirectly) help to kick start the process of revising one\u2019s ethical judgments based on new beliefs about the way things are or based on perceived inconsistencies between one\u2019s ethical judgments, or the process of formulating new ethical judgments based on their perceived consistency with preexisting ones.\nslickwombat: Sorry, are you saying that metaethics *cannot* inform moral decisions, or that they aren't useful and therefore *shouldn't*? It's not clear to me if your claim is a descriptive, epistemic-normative, or prudential one.\n\nIn any case, I'm not seeing how you're getting there... let's use an example to hopefully clarify.\n\nSuppose a squirrel is chewing up my attic, and I wish to determine whether it's morally permissible for me to shoot the squirrel (which is easy) or humanely trap it (which is very difficult). So I determine some metaethical theory, which grounds some normative theory, the application of which leads the decision that sentient creatures shouldn't be harmed. Consequently I determine that it would be wrong to shoot the squirrel and, though it's more difficult, I should trap and relocate it.\n\nIn that account, what exactly are you saying cannot happen, or is an error in judgement?\nDavid_Robert: I am proposing that metaethics cannot directly inform decisions regarding our *conduct* (with the possible exception of arguments dealing with the nature of freedom and its significance for moral responsibility). Hence, I am making a descriptive claim. In your example, your formulation of some meta-ethical theory is only causally necessary for your decision not to shoot the squirrel in so far as it may have helped you, and only indirectly, to determine how to correctly and consistently apply your ethical positions (see description above).\nslickwombat: Hang on, so are you just saying metaethics doesn't *directly* tell us what is right or wrong to do? That's trivially true in that how to actually behave is within the scope of normative/applied ethics rather than metaethics.\nDavid_Robert: I am arguing that it is false that a metaphysical account of morality is necessary for properly making practical decisions about our conduct since we don't need a metaphysical account of morality in order to determine how to revise our ethical judgments based on new beliefs about the way things are or based on perceived inconsistencies between our ethical judgments, or to formulate new ethical judgments based on their perceived consistency with preexisting ones.\n", "prompt": "David_Robert: Does meta-ethics have any bearing on our decision-making?\nAccording to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics), \"[s]ome theorists argue that a metaphysical account of morality is necessary for the proper evaluation of actual moral theories and for making practical moral decisions.\" I disagree.

That makes no sense. If that is the case, the same rule would apply any time you are invited anywhere, including your neighbors home. \n\nI don't even think the store owner has to prove negligence, they can get hold you liable on a potential conversion claim too. The simple fact is, stores aren't going around suing customers that broke something because it isn't economical to do so unless it is a big ticket item. Even if it is, there is a decent chance that the customer's homeowner's insurance could cover the damages and they can settle without the need of a lawsuit.\nfluffyluv: Well my law professor who has worked on everything from supreme Court cases to small claims says otherwise, so I'm going to defer to him. However I appreciate the obvious effort and will show him this to see what he thinks.\nYourBarracksLawyer: Christ, law students. \n\nPerhaps you\u2019re interpreting your professor beyond what he is saying. \n\nFor instance, Mr. Clumsy turns around in a china shop and his fanny pack knocks over some crystal tchotchke with a price tag of $1000. \n\nYour premise is that Mr. Clumsy has no duty of care for the items owned by the storekeeper. I don\u2019t know where that would come from. Under common law he would, and we\u2019d apply a negligence standard. \n\nOk, so how much should Clumsy pay the store owner? This is a different question. The price on the tag, wholesale cost, or some depreciated value? This is where I would bet your professor is distinguishing his argument. I wouldn\u2019t expect under the law, that Clumsy is responsible for the sticker price, but for the actual value for the item broken. \n\nSo our friend isn\u2019t obligated to buy it, but likely must make the shopkeeper whole to an amount that is below the listed sticker price. \n\nPlease update us with more.   \nfluffyluv: It says right on the PowerPoint i just pulled up that he made to check if I'm right and it literally states that you aren't legally obligated to pay for shit if you accidentally break it.\n\nAs the great Thelma once said, the law is some tricky shit.

To say this rule applies across the United States would imply long settled common law in the area of torts. The kind of torts that are taught during one\u2019s first year of law school. The class covers, generally, the duties of care each person has to every other person in our society, and how one is expecteded to act in certain situations to avoid a breach of that duty. There is more to the analysis, see palsgraf, but with what you present we don\u2019t need to cover causation or damages. \n\nYour position, from what I can tell as you\u2019ve added more facts, is that if I break something, now accidentally, I am not required to buy it. The issue I have and the lawyer before me is that your statement lacks grounding in the law. If this was valid common law you would be able to explain how the shopper was relieved of their duty to act as a reasonable person in the store.  Perhaps that the patron\u2019s actions needed to rise to the level of recklessness, above \u201caccidental\u201d for liability to attach, if that\u2019s the case. Or as mentioned above maybe you\u2019re claiming the burden to protect merchandise from shoppers falls solely to the shopkeepers. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what your getting at, but I am quite curious as to what your professor was trying to communicate to you and how it was distilled to the PowerPoint you\u2019re sighting. \nfluffyluv: Look man I'm obviously not an expert here.

My singing teacher has emphasized the importance of engaging my core to support my breathing, and I'm curious to know if others have seen significant benefits from this approach.\n\nAdditionally, I'd love to hear about any specific exercises or routines that have been helpful for singers looking to improve their breath control and overall vocal performance. Have there been any noticeable differences in terms"}
{"full_text": "BroodingBatman: How I view life as of this moment.\nWhere do I start with this post? \n\nI'm currently 25 years old. I don't really have friendships to speak up and admittedly, have never been kissed, still have the V card, and never had a girlfriend. \n\nLong story short, was never the type to make friends in my upbringing. So by the time high school came, I didn't really participate in the social aspects of it. I admit it. My mother has played a dominating presence in my life. \n\nFinancials greatly impacted my college experience. I really wanted to move out for my college experience. I and my mother had intense arguments but ultimately there wasn't anything I could do. So I lived at home through my college years. Been working and living at home ever since. I have never moved out until now. \n\nLooking back, I was greatly naive on just how expensive college was. I have come to understand where my mother was coming from. I can't help however but resent everything how it went down. To this day, I still desire the college experience I never got to have. But the person I hate the most is in fact me. I should have worked harder in high school. I wish I was more aware. Maybe I could have gotten a scholarship at UCLA or another UC and used that to my leverage to force my mom's hand. \n\nI'm 25 now but lacking the social moments that my peers my age have already had already. To put it short, I'm the book on the shelf that is covered in dust. I am in fact 18 years old in my own mind.\n\nIt's taken a while but I've come to accept that I will never have the college experience I desired nor is my adolescence or early 20's gonna come back. But I will not lie and say I don't really like what's potentially in front of me. \n\nPeople my age are busier are now. Their social groups are closed and even if you happen to find a social group of people my age, I'll feel like I'll be the least important member of the group as I came in so late. Whatever friend I make at this point, I just can't but be unsatisfied. I admit it's shallow but even if I find that one rare good friend, I can't help but see that we're all adults now. The biggest of all, despite sometime left, marriage and children are something that is beginning to loom. I will most likely never have a period in my life where my friends can be just that. My friends. Without the whole stupid cycle of returning to suburbia. \n\nIf it was up to me. Yes. Every single person in my friend group would be around 18 to 20. Same thing goes for my romantic relationships. But I also recognize that chances of having relationships like this are low and society will hate me for it. My only defense is, having friends of that age and being romantically involved with someone that age is just better suited for my maturity and is more practical for the long term. To the women my age, I'm sorry. But marriage and children is something I won't be ready for until my early 40's at the very latest, and that's only if I get lucky. I am not all out on marriage and children, but this societal pressure scares me.\n\nI resent the fact that people my age are practically my pool for human connection. Even though it is never coming back, being an adolescent is still something I want. Social interaction at this age just feels so different and I don't like it. My adolescence is something that is always going to be unfulfilled. \n\nEven though I don't think someone you only see once in three weeks is really your friend, adult friendships are all that I have. \n\nI have thought about my long-term goal of moving to France but like I posted here, socially what would it give? The more I get older, the fewer people want friends especially as an English-speaking foreigner. I still lean towards pursuing this goal only because of potential EU citizenship. Socially, however, the social rewards would not be as fruitful as I didn't reach France till older age. In actuality, I expect no reward at all other than becoming a French citizen.\n\nIn summary, I have given up on friendship, finding a partner, and human connection in general. It's kinda too late for me.\n\nEven though I vastly overshared on this post, I can't help but feel empty. I attempted suicide just nearly one year ago today. My family still doesn't know that I tried to drown myself in San Francisco. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to do it again. Maybe in Europe this time. \n\nThere's a part of me that wants out. Whether it's out of America or out of life.\n\nI apologize for such a long post.\nadyuma: Hey bro. \n\nLook, I went through a similar experience where I didnt get to experience too much of the typical college life because I was financially burdened and literally worked 16 hours a day to make ends meet and pay for my Uni fees (I was an international student in a Western country so no loans). \n\nAnyways so I thought when I turned 23 that its too late, I've gone past the point of having all that fun. Then I thought the same at 25, thinking man I could have started working on some aspects at 23 and life would be better now, and beat myself up for not taking the initiative then. And guess what, at 27 I thought the same too.\n\nThats when I realized that shit doesnt happen like in the movies, there's no coming together of things, stuff doesnt magically fall into place on its own. I always had the belief that things would work out one day, ans I lost that attitude and thought to myself that if i live till 70 (hopefully that, or more), I've really gone through only 20-30% of my life. \n\nSo then I've started proactively started doing what I've wanted to do, defy yourself and really anything here in this world is achievable if you put your heart to it (and WANT to put in the effort for it). \n\nPeople in their late 20s early 30s are still kids at heart with more responsibilities, people still want to make friends, hang out, just that they cant do it all the time cuz they've got stuff to handle. And same goes with you too, but I guarantee you there's loads of people out there that will be great friends, you gotta put yourself out there tho.\nBroodingBatman: You had me there until you validated that people our age have less time. To have friendships you must have time.\n\nPeople our age have less time as we get older.\n\nYou only proved my points even further. Human connection ain't worth it going forward. Do I sound like the type that wants to be cancelled at the last second? \n\nI ain't tolerating that shit.\nadyuma: You got me wrong bro, people make time but not for every single person. \n\nLike when I was 20 I could spend a whole day with a friend doing nothing, chilling. Now I got stuff to do so I'll spend time with a friend but I've got to get my stuff done too like work, sleep, etc. \n\nIf I'm having a really good time you sacrifice on sleep/work as well. \n\nPeople have time but are you expecting them to give you their life 24/7?\nBroodingBatman: 24/7? No. But do I want it the way it was like when I was a teenager? Absolutely.\n\nThe responsibility kills any joy I have for adult friendships. In addition to the constant nagging of wanting marriage and kids and knowing it's on the horizon for many. \n\nThere's a lot of limitations too. I know if I were to go to a rave a person my age wouldn't last as long.\n\nEverything is ultra planned. There's no having fun on a whim. I truly dislike people my age and would rather not waste my time. It ain't worth the hassle of people constantly backing out of plans.\nadyuma: So what exactly do you mean like when you were a teenager? Whats the difference now? That people have responsibilities? \n\nAnd who's nagging you to get married and have kids now? I'm guessing you're mother? \n\nAnd bro why does it matter how long you last at a rave? You went to a fucking rave and lasted all you could and enjoyed yourself, thats what matters, not seeing it till the end. \n\nIf all the people you ultra plan everything then maybe try a different group of people. Sure people plan when to meet because not everyone is available all the time, but if a friend ever called me and told me he/she wants to come over tonight or do XYZ, I'd be down, no complications. \n\nI think you're overthinking this too much man, put the effort in and you'll get the effort back\nBroodingBatman: When you were a teenager, human relationships were more front and center. As you reach adulthood, you've already done those things and your'e less willing to have a social life. Because you already had it. Some of us didn't get to have that. You want to do all those things you missed out on. Go to reckless parties during  spring break. Experiment on your body. Coachella. All that jazz. But the other party doesn't want to because they already did it. At the end, you're left feeling alone. Why do you think I crave younger friends so much? They want to do these things. \n\nAdults are just different. The naivety is gone. The wonder and excitement is gone. I guess it can be fun but there's no innocence there. I can't help but see their age. \n\nLet's face it. Adults focus on their careers and the suburban route. And for the nagging part, my cousin is my age and talks of getting married constantly. My co-workers do it to. It pisses me off. I mean it when I say I detest people my age. I want to have fun. Younger people on paper seem more fitting in terms of maturity, more willing to have fun, less likely to talk about marriage and children, and are more practical to my timeline. \n\nI know if I entered into a relationship with a woman my age, I know she's gonna want the wedding in 4 short years. Like I said, because I am so behind I don't think I should do anything like that at least till my early 40s. I'm better off associating with younger people but the chances of those relationships are low and unfortunately, they won't see me the way I want them to.\n\nSo, I'm stuck with my current age bracket who I personally think would only disappoint me. So. I'm better going alone for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm trying to give you the best response. This is what I came up with.\n\nEDIT: The more I think about it. The more I think my life at least socially has been over for a while. I'll just say there isn't really anything close in post college life that resembles the dorms and Greek Life that cultivated so many friendships. No stupid hobby or apartment with flat mates will bring those college years back. I guess the only way I truly can be happy if time was reversed and my adolescence was given back to me. The more I think about it, the more important that I kill myself eventually becomes. It's never gonna get better. Adult life is inherently disappointing. Adults are truly a pain.\nBroodingBatman: Btw man. The fun part of partying is to see it through to the morning.

I'll wait.\n[deleted]: Ah, it is always a great privilege to meet another gentleman-rapist. Good day sir. \n[deleted]: Rape jokes aren't funny!\n[deleted]: So, on the one hand, I completely agree with you.  On the other, I slightly disagree.  I agree that 99.9% of rape jokes are stupid jokes, relying on shocking people with the idea of rape in order to get any response - be it a laugh or anything else.  Those are stupid and unfunny.\n\nHowever, as painful and awful as rape is, it sadly is a part of the world we live in.  I think that anything that exists (and some things that don't) have the potential to be funny in one or two different ways.  The first way, generally, is that people will laugh at a joke because it is something that they have experienced.  \"What's the deal with airline peanuts?!\"  is a perfect example of this observational humor.  \n\nThe other way something can be funny is if it is something that no one has ever experienced.  If the joke clashes with reality in a certain way, or is surreal to a large enough degree that can also be considered funny.\n\nThe joke that I made falls into the latter.  Who has ever heard of a gentleman rapist?  The concept itself is a paradox.  My joke wasn't meant to make light of rape, just to create a character that doesn't exist, in order to poke fun at him.\n\nI'm sorry if you found my joke offensive, it wasn't meant to be taken as a \"rape joke\".\njordiehp: I get what you're trying to say, and I hate to use the \"slippery slope\" argument, but I feel like it just opens the doors and blurs the lines between what you're trying to do and distasteful/disrespectful jokes that promote the idea that it's okay to laugh at rape. \n[deleted]: I think the whole point people who say distasteful / disrespectful rape jokes are trying to make is that they know exactly where the line is, and are they are intentionally crossing it to accomplish some kind of shock factor.  \n\nThe difference here is that there are rape jokes, and there are jokes which deal with rape.  Similarly, there are racist jokes, and there are jokes that deal with issues of race.  I'm sure that both of us, having used the internet, and therefore interacted with a certain number of idiots before can both come up with a few racist jokes.  A joke I think isn't in and of itself racist, but points out issues of race in our society would be something along the lines of\n\n\"Q: How many policemen does it take to change a light bulb? \n\nA: None.  They just beat the room for being dark.\" \n\nIn neither this, nor the joke I made about gentlemen rapists is the punchline something to the effect of either \"Rape is intrinsically funny\", or \"People of color are intrinsically inferior, and therefore funny\".  The punchline is making fun of either racist cops, or rapists.\n\nI agree that Rape and Racism can be two of the most uncomfortable subjects to talk about, but I think the truly slippery slope is to get into the discussion of what you can and can't talk about in a joke.\n\nRather than blur the line between what is distasteful/disrespectful, I think these two jokes show that you can make jokes about uncomfortable subjects without offending anyone who doesn't truly deserve it (racists / rapists).\n\nI know that that sounds incredibly hokey, but I think a truly funny \"clean\" joke about an \"un-PC\" topic can do worlds of good in terms of encouraging people to raise the bar above the lowest-common-denominator jokes.\njordiehp: Hm, okay. Your argument makes sense and I commend you on making a logical argument instead of what most interenet users do (Idk how it is on reddit, just joined recently, but you know what I mean: youtube comments and the like). I still don't find the joke funny, but I feel like I can understand where you're coming from.\n[deleted]: Ha.  Thanks, I try to keep the level of discourse a bit higher than the average youtube comment section.  You are definitely allowed to think my jokes are not funny.  I know most of my friends would agree with you, that my jokes are lame.\njordiehp: Can I at least recommend [this](http://www.fugitivus.net/2009/06/24/a-woman-walks-into-a-rape-uh-bar/) as maybe a skim-through? It's a bit long, but it gives good insight as to why I, and many others, don't find any rape jokes to be funny.\n[deleted]: You absolutely can recommend that, it is an excellent article.  I completely understand that rape jokes aren't funny, nor would I ever make light of rape.  That being said, having the word \"rape\" or in this case, \"rapist\" in a joke does not automatically make it a rape joke.  My joke is making fun of rapists, not victims of rape.\n", "prompt": "pink_play-doh: Lifehack for people who carry pepper spray.\n \nAttach ~~pepper~~ **whatever** spray **you prefer** to a retractable keychain and hook it to your purse/bag for easy access.

{"full_text": "wowbobwow: YSK about the little-known band Jellyfish, which only released two albums and never received widespread fame but went on to become hugely influential\nFirst, a disclaimer: I have no connection to Jellyfish or any of the folks associated with them - I'm just a fan who discovered their music a couple years ago and was astonished that they aren't more widely known.\n\nWikipedia has [the whole story,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish_\\(band\\)) but here's the TL;DR: Jellyfish formed in San Francisco in 1989, released two albums of gorgeous and intricately-produced music (generally lumped into the \"power pop\" genre), and broke apart in 1994. There were a few people who cycled through the band during its brief lifetime, but the two principal creative forces driving the group and their sound were [Roger Joseph Manning Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Joseph_Manning_Jr.) and [Andy Sturmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Sturmer). \n\nDespite being driving by a pair of legitimate creative / musical geniuses, Jellyfish had some absolutely terrible luck, which almost certainly contributed to their lack of commercial success. Two serious problems in particular stand out to me:\n\n* Their 'visual style' heavily borrowed from San Francisco's 1960's hippie culture (on-stage look, album art and music videos), and was just hopelessly dated and silly by the early 1990's. Almost all their videos and live concerts display this style, and it's really at odds with their sound\n* Their sound (both recorded and live) was *gorgeous*, using complex vocal harmonies and intricate multi-layered instrumentation (note the repeated and enchanting use of harpsichord in several of the tracks I link below)... all of which was completely at odds with the rapid swing into the Grunge Era they were musically competing against in the early '90s\n\nJellyfish only released two full albums (not counting some demo tapes and a few live bootlegs): Bellybutton and Spilt Milk. Both albums are absolutely crammed with tracks that evoke (without entirely ripping off) many familiar artists and bands, ranging from The Beatles, Badfinger, Cheap Trick, Queen, The Beach Boys, etc.  - basically any major group that incorporated complex harmonies and arrangements within the rock/pop genres. Put another way: if you like any songs from any of the groups I just listed off, you're almost sure to find at least a couple songs from Jellyfish that you'll adore.\n\nFor anyone who isn't already familiar with Jellyfish and their two albums, here are a few selected tracks from each of their albums, with a few personal notes or observations:\n\nBellybutton (1990):\n\n* [The Man I Used To Be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEA0dwWB7yg) - Apparently determined to begin their musical career by being weird (but also beautiful), Jellyfish opens their first album with a dark but catchy exploration of the toll that war (or any parental separation) can take on a family\n* [That Is Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQTj_2mMfSA) - Here's a perfect example of one of the problems I noted above: here's an absolutely *perfect* '90s power pop song, saddled with a silly and dated looking music video. I'm tempted to only link to the song itself without the video, but maybe seeing the video will help clarify why Jellyfish didn't explode in the MTV era the way their music should've demanded\n* [She Still Loves Him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M5zRbuEbE8) - Another beautifully-written song exploring a dark topic (physically abusive doomed relationships), with a sound that evokes something Paul McCartney &amp; Wings might've put out\n* [Baby's Coming Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I48AFJKCt20) - Just exquisite power-pop, but with clever lyrics often not found in the genre\n\nBellybutton showed a young band flexing their creative muscles while also being pretty up-front about their musical influences. While many of the songs on Bellybutton were exceptionally good, the album as a whole didn't feel quite complete. After Bellybutton gained moderate critical acclaim but failed to result in major sales success or significant national recognition, Jellyfish retreated to the recording studio and focused all their creative and technical abilities on their second and final album, Spilt Milk. Instead of shying away from evoking their musical influences, Jellyfish basically doubled-down and set out to create a power-pop magnum opus, complete with wide-ranging lyrical themes, rich sonic tapestries, complex and nuanced instrumentation, and heartbreakingly beautiful vocal harmonies. Here are a few particularly amazing tracks, but really, if you've made it this far in this crazy long post, you should just listen to the whole damn album from start to end.\n\nSpilt Milk (1993):\n\n* [Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSD00bMSrhs) - Jellyfish, always determined to buck expectations, opens their second and final album with a sweet harmonized lullaby, effectively setting the stage for the rest of the album both musically (those layered harmonies!) and thematically (it's all a dream, but hold on tight anyway)\n* [Joining A Fan Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JojV8kNfWK8) - Rocketing out of the peaceful reassurance of Hush, Joining A Fan Club is a powerful comparison between the youthful longings of a teenaged fan dreaming of her pop idol, and her parental figure feeling similarly enraptured by an exploitative televangelist\n* [Glutton Of Sympathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-8Flo4Udmk) - Being lonely sucks, but it sucks less when you can write and sing about it this beautifully \n* [The Ghost At #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjL1WhqH9Xc) - This song explores the tragedy of rock gods who only get their much-deserved respect after dying young... recorded by a band for their final album after failing to get their much-deserved recognition while they were still going. There's a bit of irony here\n* [Bye Bye Bye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qxuAncj1WQ) - A portrait of loves lost, framed with a klezmer song structure and backed by harmonies that would've been right at home in The Beatle's \"Eleanor Rigby\" \n* [He's My Best Friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmlubhrI7Dc) - A weird, sonically complex, funky, insanely catchy ode to the singer's penis - pretty much the prototypical Jellyfish song\n\nOkay, that's it - this is already way longer than I meant it to be when I started writing after dinner tonight! [Here's the blog post](https://defendingaxlrose.com/2012/07/07/your-next-favorite-band-jellyfish/) I randomly stumbled across a couple years ago that brought Jellyfish into my life - I owe that blog post a lot for bringing Jellyfish into my life. I hope someone else enjoyed this post as much as I've enjoyed writing it!\n\n**EDIT:** Per a suggestion from /u/bamboo-coffee, here are Spotify links to the two Jellyfish albums:\n\n[Bellybutton](https://open.spotify.com/album/6AvUI8ZOKncy7e6ThVbtAV)\n\n[Spilt Milk](https://open.spotify.com/album/2xWIi4fDWJZT2Mw3ydTIO7)\nPanicBlitz: The first time I ever heard them was the song [Ignorance Is Bliss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xdwze-Wj6_4) from Nintendo's White Knuckle Scorin' album.

Compliment any behavior you **appreciate** and you will receive more of it. Pay more attention to the people who are being kind, than the ones who aren't.\n\n4. Talk about \"those types of people\", when discussing something they did. Letting them know you're not upset *yet*, but allowing them to save face and give them a chance to correct the behavior... while still calling them out in a subtle way. \n\nExample: Yeah, sometimes the people who look down on others for their appearance are actually just projecting their insecurities onto others.

Also it's very important to have a confident vibe. I always have a slight smile (genuine), with open, approachable body language. I give good eye contact to whoever's speaking. I try to engage others around me, using their name at least once. I will touch people (lightly) in a neutral spot like the arm while I'm making a point. (not repeatedly. A little goes along way when it comes to touching! But it seems to affect people positively)  I bring an enthusiastic vibe to my interactions.\nPickledSpaceHog: Yes absolutely! Confidence and body language can go such a long way. \n\nI just know that in helping a few of my friends, they weren't sure on how to exude confidence or get nervous and don't have super great body language.\n\nAnd I am so uncomfortable with physical touch even though I know people probably enjoy it. I just don't want to encourage them to touch me at all.

Last week, I think the election coverage just sapped any motivation I had left. It's been a really rough time lately. I've been unemployed for over a month and getting lots of interviews but no offers yet. Things with the girlfriend have been bad and it's really hurt my outlook. Money is tight and up until Saturday my roommate and I had been unsuccessfully looking for a new tenant. Well now the election is decided, we have a new roommate, I had two promising interviews today and several scheduled for this week, and my girlfriend and I are gonna try to heal things tonight. So I forced myself to go outside and do some shit, although I admit it wasn't fucking easy to take that first step. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started by doing a bridge hold and trying to push my stomach as high in the air as possible. I'm not particularly flexible and my bridge kind of sucks, so I think it's important to keep stretching those muscles to get that synovial fluid in there. Followed up with a few L-Holds, and I was surprised to discover that I can actually hold my legs out almost straight with my butt almost completely off the ground for a couple seconds before collapsing. Couldn't even get my butt off the ground at all a few months ago. I rounded out the stretches with some twist holds and amazingly I can actually lock my hands behind my back on my right side. Left side is still pretty tight but I'm seeing slow progress with a hand towel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to pushups. I started with just a few conventional pushups to get the blood circulating, and then a few close pushups. I migrated to one of the beer die tables in the backyard and did a few one-arm incline pushups with legs apart at first, then together. Legs together is so much fucking harder it's not even funny, even with such a steep incline. I can feel my feet slipping from underneath me. I'm trying so hard to not rotate my torso when coming back up, and I'm trying to avoid splaying my elbows. Left arm is having a hell of a time keeping up with the right. I transitioned to the ground for some slow and steady close pushups. I've stopped counting and recording reps like I used to, I just go until it hurts but before failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext were leg raises. Started out on the ground with straight legs, and the next set I moved to the bar. Hanging leg raises are a lot harder for me because I feel more of a strain in my quads, and I tend to swing a little. I tried keeping my core flexed and tight the whole time to avoid swinging, but at this point I feel like I can get my muscles burning more on my back because my stamina is so much less while hanging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, grip training. Started with some clenched eagle claws, then 2 sets of 5 fingertip pushups to work the tops of the fingers. I did a few hangs from the bar to warm up, and then started some towel hangs. Jesus, is my endurance lower with the towel, and it's not even a thick one. But if I can get up to 30 seconds with the towel I'll be pretty happy with that, as I can do about a minute on the bar. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was it for the day. I went in, made my 1 giant meal for the day, started my fasting timer, and I'll try to hop on the stationary bike later tonight.

{"full_text": "Lnfinite_god: Is it normal to not enjoy people's company?\nWhen I'm completely isolated I do enjoy a bit of occasional small talk, but like now, when I'm amongst people pretty often (almost daily), I just find it annoying. I honestly can't work up the energy to be nice and polite or to make small talk. It seems like too much effort. I rather run a marathon (by myself).\n\nI gotta say though, a friendly smile from a cute girl on the street makes me feel good, no matter how social or isolated I am.\nArtamovement: It depends what you mean by \"not enjoy.\" Some people need to hang around others all the time. Some people need a lot of alone time to recharge. Some jobs are well suited to people who need large amounts of solitude, like park rangers. I would recommend that you find the right balance of sociability that works for you but also you should take care that you are not antagonizing to others.\nLnfinite_god: what's antagonizing?\nArtamovement: Thinking of others as anything but your kinsmen, comrades, or dear friends. Sending anything other than warm feelings to yourself or others.  (This is obviously for situations where you lose nothing by doing so, such as at work or walking down the street.)\nLnfinite_god: Well, when I can't put in the effort to be kind and nice, I send indifferent feelings. Mostly because I am bored and not enjoying myself. Doesn't have anything to do with people. That's why I probably don't like their company, I have to worry about my feelings are affecting others, which is like an extra pain in the ass when you're already not enjoying yourself.\nArtamovement: What are the barriers that keep you from enjoying yourself around others? \n\nAlso, I would add that there will come a time when you will need friends and allies, and you will wish you had sent good vibes to more people. Friends are precisely the people who will secure for you opportunities. \nLnfinite_god: That's not a motivation to make friends: \"some day some of em might give you an opportunity\".\n\nPeople are different, I want what I want and others want something else. It gets very tiring to always have to ask everyone to do what you want to do, when what everyone else always seems to wanna do, is something other than you want to do. \n\nI've heard many times that I am different than the majority of people.\nArtamovement: The question then is one of finding people with similar interests. Also, having friends who can offer opportunities is simply a matter of ensuring you have options in life, instead of no options, which is the very definition of poverty.  \n\nI can't quite make out what you mean by what you want, but let's take it in a broader sense: Do you want knowledge? Do you want skills?  Building relationships with people is the way to pursue these goals, and building relationships means having long conversations. \n\nLet's say you want to build a robot. You could probably find people who want to do the same thing. Or, start a heavy metal band, build a hut, create a video game, whatever. Absolutely no one can succeed entirely by themselves, and all you need to do is show some goodwill, ask a question, and not interrupt someone when they talk in order to make a friend.\nLnfinite_god: if it takes that little, I suppose you could say I have friends at the table tennis clubs I play. I just never considered them as 'real' friends, because I don't meet up with them outside of table tennis. Well apart from one guy, to see his TT robot, cuz I wanted to buy it.\n\nMy goal is to become very good at table tennis, in order to do so I have to work on my technique and train often. At my club, most people are there for enjoyment or exercise, but no one is quite as motivated to get much better as me (the ones that are pretty good, barely come there, and when they do, I barley get a chance to play with them). So even those people with the same interest, are much different than me. Because all I want to do is drills and focus on having the proper technique, whilst they want to play matches/free play and use whatever technique that comes natural to them. When they do or say they do try to use proper technique during or after a tt lesson, they simply can't do it or not for long. They always go back to what's familiar and natural to them. Which is annoying, because it makes it very hard to do good drills with, in fact, you can't. Because a good drill requires both players to use proper technique. So the only way I can properly train for table tennis is when I pay 15 euros for an hour of training with a coach, or when I play at home against a piece of wood (which is hard because it bounces the ball back too slow or not at all). With these coaches I can easily talk non stop about table tennis, because they probably used to have the same or similar passion for it. In the beginning I could have fun talking with the more recreational beginners with bad technique (well they mostly did the talking), but most of that probably had to do with me not having talked to people in a long time. Now that I'm used to it, I'm not as interested in what they have to say anymore, I mean never was, but I enjoyed the company, now I enjoy the company much less. If the person doesn't have a similar passion or knowledge, I can only small talk for a couple of minutes before it starts to bore and disgust me. (if small talk lasts ~2 minutes I do enjoy it. But much longer and I don't.)\nArtamovement: It sounds like you've got a lot of drive and determination.  Table tennis is certainly fun and I'd enjoy playing it more often than occasionally. \n\nI would say that anyone with the drive to get really really good at something is going to look like an eccentric to people who have no goals--that is until the goal-oriented person becomes an exemplar.  \n\nI wouldn't look down on people who don't share your passion but rather find out and admire them for the passions they do have. That being said, it is up to you to determine the amount of time hanging around others that is advantageous to your goals.\n\nLastly, everyone rolls their eyes at small talk but there is no way to get people to talk about the interesting things that matter to them without establishing trust based on common interests and opinions through small talk. You also lose nothing by getting good at it, so why not?\nLnfinite_god: well with certain people, you get a feel there won't be many common interests. For example I'm 22 into sport, internet and film, single, no job, one guy is 55 who is a baker, kids and wife. Apart from table tennis, we probably don't have many common interests. His life is his job, wife, kids and table tennis, it's a cool life, but different from me.\n\nI wouldn't look down on people who don't share my passion either. I don't see why anyone would, I don't even see how that thought entered your mind.\n\nI think admiring is a pretty strong word. You can admire all your friends if you want, but don't demand me to do that.\n\nI'm pretty sure not everyone rolls their eyes at small talk, almost everyone I regularly see (mostly 40+ men with kids), seem to **love** small talk.\n", "prompt": "Lnfinite_god: Is it normal to not enjoy people's company?\nWhen I'm completely isolated I do enjoy a bit of occasional small talk, but like now, when I'm amongst people pretty often (almost daily), I just find it annoying.

This went on until former interns started filing complaints with labour regulators and generating bad press. The internship program tried to tell the people who were still there that these complaints were from a few \"bad apples\" who didn't understand what the rewards of the internship program were, but it didn't stop dozens of people from leaving the program until they eventually shut the thing down. And no tears were shed.\n\nThe fact that people were able to change something here, even if it meant that one unpaid internship program in an industry filled with dozens was shut down, makes me hopeful that people can start standing up for themselves and one another.\nvenuswasaflytrap: Was there any benefit to being in that internship?\nThe_Narrator_9000: Yes, we did get to learn some technical and creative skills and apply them to a professional corporate environment, which will be useful for me. However, there was always a sense of being separated from the rest of the company, with little chance to network with employees outside the internship program itself or find a permanent, full time position. There was a feeling that what we were doing wasn't really of value to the rest of the company, which, combined with the lack of pay, left a bad taste in people's mouths.\nvenuswasaflytrap: Was it worth 40 hours a week unpaid?\nThe_Narrator_9000: Not really, no.\nvenuswasaflytrap: Was that obvious to you at the time? I guess I'm having trouble understanding why anyone would willingly take a position like that.\nThe_Narrator_9000: At the time, it seemed like I was getting the chance to prove my worth to a major company and gain an opportunity for a permanent job. I wanted to show them that I was a good, competent professional and believed that once I did that, I would move up.\n\nHowever, I soon found that the internship program worked like a revolving door for most people - they would come in, work for a couple of months, then leave with maybe a reference. It was a transient place. There were a lot of people who complained amongst themselves, but very few people said anything to the management because we all wanted a reference or some kind of opportunity from this big company. That's how they got us to stick with the place. It seems flimsy when you think about it, but when you have a group of recent university graduates who really want to get a job in their field and have been struggling to find work, these kinds of promises combined with a sleek presentation can really work.\n\nEventually though, people would see that it wasn't leading to much and would take their skills elsewhere. Some people even left because they could no longer afford to commute to the office with no pay. I stayed longer than a lot of people and was only offered a temporary paid position *after* I submitted my resignation notice. Even though it was paid, though, it would have required even longer hours and the same long commute for me, plus I had realized by that time that the culture within the company really didn't fit me, so I turned it down. A few months later the program was gone, so I probably would have been let go anyway.\n\nI guess the main lesson I learned is that you have to be careful when you are struggling and looking for work. Some offers seem enticing and filled with promises, but really demand more from you than they give in return. It took me awhile to find this out, but now I can say that if your work/internship situation isn't healthy or benefiting you, you need to have the courage to stand up for yourself or resign, because it's the only way to make change in a bad situation.\n", "prompt": "june_oyster: Battered Worker Syndrome\n\nThe_Narrator_9000: This article reminds me of the time when I worked at an unpaid internship that required interns to work 40 hours a week while also coercing them into doing more.

{"full_text": "RationalHeretic23: CMV: Superstition is false\nI reject the idea of superstition because there is no way in which the proposed cause(e.g. wearing lucky underwear) can bring about the effect(e.g. winning a football game).\n\nMy problem with superstition is that it fails to account for the principle of causality. What I mean by that is just that for every effect, there is a cause. Every effect is preceded by a cause that is causally linked to the effect. Therefore, there is a causal relationship between causes and their effects. This is not to be confused with a correlation. The well-known phrase \u201ccorrelation does not equal causation\u201d is extremely important here. Two things can be correlated with absolutely no causal relationship linking the two. The problem is that oftentimes people observe a correlation and automatically assume that they are causally related. I think this is one of the things that leads to belief in superstition. But let\u2019s consider an example of superstition to make this clearer.\n\nSo let's think of a classic example of superstition. Wearing lucky underwear helps OU sooners win at football. The cause in this situation is wearing lucky underwear. The effect is OU winning at football. For there to be a true causal relationship between the cause and effect in this situation, there must be a mechanism by which wearing lucky underwear results in OU winning at football. But, it is impossible to conceive of a way in which wearing lucky underwear could affect what happens in a football game. If you're at home watching a football game, there's nothing you can do to affect what happens during that football game. To disagree with that statement, I think one needs to provide an explanation of the way in which the cause brings about the effect. Therefore, my position is that those who posit a supernatural cause for any given effect must provide an explanation of the way in which the cause brings about the effect.\n\nIt is likely that some might agree with me in my statement that there always needs to be a mechanism by which causes bring about effects, but they might disagree that this mechanism needs to be explainable. In other words, one might argue that there is a mechanism by which wearing lucky underwear affects an OU football game, but that we simply do not understand this mechanism. Perhaps the mechanism is by some supernatural means that we are incapable of understanding.\n\nMy response would be to ask why we should be inclined to take seriously any posited causal relationship that is without any explanation of the mechanism linking the cause and effect, when there are numerous other posited causal relationships from which to choose that do have such an explanation. In other words, why should I believe that lucky underwear affects an OU game, even though there is no explanation for such an idea, when I can believe that the OU game is affected by the skill of the team's players? I propose an alternate causal relationship in which I am much more inclined to believe. In my proposed causal relationship, the skill of the team's players is the cause, and the result of the OU game is the effect. In my example, it is easy to understand the mechanism by which the cause brings about the effect. Team skill influences the ability of the team to play well, which in turn influences the score of the game. So basically what I'm saying is that there is no reason to believe in a cause that has no explanation when I can believe in a cause that has a clear and undeniable explanation. \n\nIt is likely that one might fully agree with me that we should always accept a natural explanation over a supernatural one when we have access to the natural explanation. However, they might go on to say that we are entirely justified in believing supernatural explanations when we have no natural explanations to oppose the supernatural one. I disagree with this, and I believe the best way to argue against such an idea is to appeal to history. Now, the problem is that we humans have not always had natural explanations from which to choose when attempting to understand an observed phenomenon. Historically, it has often been the case that we observed some phenomena, unexplainable by the science of the time, and therefore we were inclined to believe in a supernatural explanation. This instilled in us a habit of reliance upon supernatural explanations, which remains vestigial in society today. Fortunately science has dramatically progressed throughout time and has subsequently disproven time and time again many of the supernatural explanations once commonly held in society. We can easily observe the historical pattern that has been occurring. We observe a phenomenon unexplainable by natural means at the time. We then conceive of some supernatural explanation. Then science progresses and proves that this phenomenon transpired naturally the entire time, we just didn't understand how. \n\nSo for the sake of clarification, I want to present the two different scenarios discussed here. In each of these scenarios, there is a phenomenon that we observe and we then attribute a cause to it. These two scenarios differ from each other in that those in the first scenario have access to natural explanations that oppose the supernatural explanations, but the second scenario does not have any natural explanation to oppose the supernatural explanation.\n\n1) This is the example of the OU game. We observe an effect, OU winning the game, and attribute a cause. First, there is a posited supernatural cause (wearing lucky underwear). This supernatural cause has no explanation of how it could have brought about the effect. Second, there is a posited natural cause (team skill level). This natural cause has an undisputable causal relationship with the effect and provides an undeniable explanation of how it could bring about the effect. Therefore, in scenarios such as this one, there is no reason to accept the supernatural cause, having no explanation, when there is a natural cause with a clear explanation.\n\n2) The second scenario is the historical scenario I mentioned earlier. In this scenario, there are no natural explanations for the effect we are observing. We simply do not understand what is causing the effect. For example, a society many years ago observes a lunar eclipse turn the moon red. Their understanding of astronomy is not sufficient enough to understand the natural cause for this observed phenomenon, and so they therefore conceive of a supernatural cause. This is different from the first scenario in that there was no known natural explanation for the red moon. In circumstances such as these, I argue that it is always better to simply acknowledge our ignorance as a species and realize there might be some things we can\u2019t explain at the time rather than to attribute a supernatural cause. History has consistently proven that supernatural explanations are unable to withstand the test of time, and eventually are replaced by natural explanations once we gain the ability to understand the phenomenon. Therefore, we should learn from history by taking note of our historical tendency to falsely conceive of supernatural causes. Instead, we need to realize that knowledge is not a closed book, and that simply because we don\u2019t have a natural explanation for something, doesn\u2019t mean that such an explanation doesn\u2019t exist, regardless of it being inaccessible by us.\n\nSo, in both of these two scenarios I am arguing that believing in a supernatural cause is the incorrect course of action.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

All effects have a natural cause, regardless of whether or not we understand how the cause brings about the effect.\ncaw81: I think your argument is \"All things in nature is caused by nature.  If its not caused by nature, its just that we haven't found the cause of it.\"\n\nYou seem to preemptively dismiss evidence of a non-natural cause claiming ignorance or some sort of axiom.  \"It can't be supernatural, there *must* be a natural cause we don't know yet\". What is your support for this claim that it must be natural?  \nRationalHeretic23: There has never been a demonstrated occurrence of any supernatural phenomena existing. Supernatural claims have been posited for millennia, only to be later rejected by more informed epochs. I am wondering why one should even consider a cause anything but natural, when nothing other than natural phenomena has ever been confirmed to exist. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is any other means by which causes can bring about effects other than natural means.\ncaw81: &gt; There has never been a demonstrated occurrence of any supernatural phenomena existing.\n\nThat's not proof of anything.  Its a problem of induction.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction\n\n&gt; I am wondering why one should even consider a cause anything but natural, when nothing other than natural phenomena has ever been confirmed to exist.\n\nBecause the lack of confirmation of existence is not proof of \"it does not exist\".\nRationalHeretic23: I agree with you. I am not arguing that I am certain that supernatural phenomena does not exist, because such an argument would be against the principles of science. Science doesn't set out to \"disprove\" things, but rather it sets out to determine the plausibility of certain claims. What I am arguing is that given that there is no evidence for anything other than natural phenomena, the existence of supernatural phenomena is highly improbable, and is therefore an unreasonable idea in which to believe.\ncaw81: &gt;  I am not arguing that I am certain that supernatural phenomena does not exist, \n\nYour CMV is \"Superstition is false\".\n\n&gt; What I am arguing is that given that there is no evidence for anything other than natural phenomena,\n\nThis is nowhere in your View.  In the View you try to make a case; \"My problem with superstition is that it fails to account for the principle of causality. \"  This is not the lack of evidence but the lack of \"principle of causality\".  \n\n&gt;  the existence of supernatural phenomena is highly improbable, and is therefore an unreasonable idea in which to believe.\n\nSaying something is \"highly improbable\" and \"unreasonable\" is different from saying something is \"false\".  There is no hedging in the later.\n\nRationalHeretic23: \u2206\n\nYou have convinced me about my title. I did not put much thought into it at the time, but I now agree that I should not say that \"Superstition is false\". I guess after rethinking it, I should have had my title as \"Evidence for the validity of superstition is non-existent, and therefore should not be considered true\". That is my main point I'm trying to get across. \n\nWhat I mean when I say \"My problem with superstition is that it fails to account for the principle of causality\" is that those who believe in superstition fail to recognize that there must be a causal relationship between an effect and what brings about an effect. Believers in superstition will often say things like, \"walking under this tower will result in one taking an extra year to graduate\"(a common belief at my university). My response is to ask what the causal relationship is between walking under the tower and taking an extra year to graduate. They simply are unable to give a mechanism by which the cause brings about the effect. \n\nI stand by the importance of considering the principle of causality when thinking about superstition. However, you are right to criticize my title for saying \"Superstition is false\".\ncaw81: &gt; those who believe in superstition fail to recognize that there must be a causal relationship between an effect and what bring about an effect\n\n* You don't have that same level of evidence for unexplained things that you an assume there is a natural cause for.  \"We just don't know of the natural cause, yet.\" is more hand-waving than demanding causation that you require for superstitions.  \n\n* \"Invisible tower fairies that live in another dimension will cause you to to take an extra year.  It is their purpose in life.\"  Now I've given you the causal relationship, so now you will consider superstitions to be true.\nRationalHeretic23: It is a fact that there must be a causal relationship between an effect and what brings about an effect. This is a philosophical fact. Me saying \"we just don't know of the natural cause, yet\" does not mean that a causal relationship does not exist. To clarify, I am not demanding causation to be required for only superstition. I am demanding causation to be required for all phenomena. All effects have a cause. There is no evidence of anything other than natural causes taking place. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to believe that supernatural causes affect our Universe.\ncaw81: &gt; To clarify, I am not demanding causation to be required for only superstition. I am demanding causation to be required for all phenomena\n\nThat's not in your View.  You excuse it away;  \"Instead, we need to realize that knowledge is not a closed book, and that simply because we don\u2019t have a natural explanation for something, doesn\u2019t mean that such an explanation doesn\u2019t exist, regardless of it being inaccessible by us.\"  So \"No supernatural cause then it doesn't exist, the book is closed\" but \"No natural cause then it still might exist, the book is still open\".  Why two different rules?\n\nAnd what about my \"invisible faeries\" causation?  Shouldn't that demand your \"causation\" requirement?\n\n\nRationalHeretic23: It is in my view. At the beginning I said, \"for every effect, there is a cause. Every effect is preceded by a cause that is causally linked to the effect.\" Notice I said *every* effect is causally linked. This means that I am saying that causation is always required. \n\nYou quoted \"Instead, we need to realize that knowledge is not a closed book, and that simply because we don\u2019t have a natural explanation for something, doesn\u2019t mean that such an explanation doesn\u2019t exist, regardless of it being inaccessible by us.\" Let me address this. What I mean is that there is always a cause for every effect, regardless of whether or not we understand it. Sometimes, we do not have access to enough to information to understand the natural process by which something occurs. This doesn't mean that there isn't a cause for whatever effect we don't understand. It just means that we are not aware of the cause. My point is that in instances like this, when we don't know the cause, we shouldn't immediately assume that there must be a supernatural cause. Not understanding how something could have happened naturally does not mean that it must have happened supernaturally. All this means is that there is information that we do not know about how how something happened. There is only evidence for the Universe behaving in one way, naturally. Therefore, what I am saying is that just because we don't understand the natural process by which something occurred, doesn't mean we should posit an entirely different idea of how the Universe behaves (supernaturally), even though there is no evidence for the Universe behaving in such a way. Instead of proposing an entirely different idea of how the universe behaves that has no evidence supporting it, we should recognize that there is likely a natural explanation we don't understand, which therefore does not propose an entirely different idea of how the Universe behaves.\n\nRegarding your Fairies example, it absolutely demands my causation requirement, which you would be unable to meet. You propose that the fairies \"cause\" me to stay another year. My response is that there needs to be a causal relationship between the actions of the fairies (the cause) and me taking an extra year of school (the effect). In other words, there needs to exist a mechanism by which the actions of the fairies could bring about me taking an extra year. Me taking an extra year *must* be the result of something happening, or there must be some reason for me taking an extra year. In that sense, it is clear that this situation demands my causation requirement. If we observed that all of those who walk under the tower actually take an extra year to graduate, then one should surely consider the proposition of tower fairies. But, the important thing is that we don't observe things like this! Suppose 100% of those who walk under the tower take an extra year. This would be evidence that there is some sort of causal relationship between walking under the tower and taking an extra year to graduate. It is impossible to conceive of a natural way in which walking under a clock tower would result in taking an extra year. Therefore, if such a situation occurred, then by all means we should consider supernaturalism. The thing is, situations like this do NOT occur. Any time someone postulates a supernatural causation, there is always either a more reasonable and plausible natural causation that we are aware of, or there is a natural causation that we are unaware of. Why do I assume that there is a natural causation that we are unaware of? Because there is no evidence of the Universe behaving in any other way than naturally.\n\n\ncaw81: &gt; Notice I said every effect is causally linked. This means that I am saying that causation is always required. \n\nWhere is the demand for causation when you say \" In circumstances such as these, I argue that it is always better to simply acknowledge our ignorance as a species and realize there might be some things we can\u2019t explain at the time rather than to attribute a supernatural cause.\"\n\n&gt; It just means that we are not aware of the cause.\n\nYou mean \"we are not aware of the *natural* cause\".  \n\n&gt; when we don't know the cause, we shouldn't immediately assume that there must be a supernatural cause. \n\nBut you discard the other way \"since we don't know the supernatural cause we shouldn't immediately assume there must be a natural cause\".  There is no justification for discarding this one but not the other.\n\n&gt; There is only evidence for the Universe behaving in one way, naturally. \n\nBut lack of evidence is not proof of non-existence.  Yet your whole assumption is that it does.\n\n&gt; what I am saying is that just because we don't understand the natural process by which something occurred, doesn't mean we should posit an entirely different idea of how the Universe behaves (supernaturally), even though there is no evidence for the Universe behaving in such a way.\n\nBut your alternative has problems too.  \"We don't know what the natural cause is, but lets accept that there is one\"  Why is one more acceptable than another?\n\n&gt; there needs to exist a mechanism by which the actions of the fairies could bring about me taking an extra year.\n\nI can just say the mechanism is that \"faeries then follow you around and randomly/creatively cause the extra year, depend on the person's circumstances\".  But you don't demand this mechanism when you say \"we just don't know the natural cause yet\".  The natural cause mechanism is totally absent yet its acceptable.  \n\n&gt; Suppose 100% of those who walk under the tower take an extra year. This would be evidence that there is some sort of causal relationship between walking under the tower and taking an extra year to graduate.  It is impossible to conceive of a natural way in which walking under a clock tower would result in taking an extra year. Therefore, if such a situation occurred, then by all means we should consider supernaturalism.\n\nReally?  So 100% of the time I rub my lucky rabbits foot something lucky happens to me within the next month (and I explain it by saying invisible fairies) , this is a causal relationship and so supernatural?  Because it did happen 100% of the time I rubbed by lucky rabbit foot the three times I did it.  So you accept this as evidence of the supernatural?\n\n&gt; Why do I assume that there is a natural causation that we are unaware of? Because there is no evidence of the Universe behaving in any other way than naturally.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that there is no supernatural causation.  Lack of evidence doesn't mean proof of non-existence.\nRationalHeretic23: 1) Acknowledging our ignorance as a species and recognizing that we may observe effects with natural causes we don't yet understand does not in any way negate the demand for causation. A cause exists, we just don't fully understand it.\n\n2) Yes, I mean we are not aware of the natural cause. It still exists, though.\n\n3 &amp; 4) There absolutely is justification for discarding one but not the other. Again, I agree with you that lack of evidence does not equal non-existence. I am not arguing for the non-existence of supernaturalism, just as I would not argue for the non-existence of an invisible flying teapot orbiting mars.[Please read the first paragraph of this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot)\nWe know for a fact that effects are brought about by natural means all the time in the Universe. A naturally behaving Universe is the one assumption that we agree on, you just want to posit that there is another way (supernaturally) in which the Universe can sometimes behave in addition to naturally. I'm arguing that there is no reason to consider such an idea when there is no evidence of such a phenomenon existing. Since there is no evidence of supernaturalism existing, it is highly improbable to exist when compared to naturalism. Therefore I do not reject supernaturalism because I am sure it does not exist, I reject it because naturalism has a far greater probability of existing.\n\n5) Why is one more acceptable than another? Because again, we know that the Universe frequently behaves naturally. Therefore it is not surprising in any way to conceive of a natural mechanism that we simply do not understand. In fact, this has happened countless times during our history! 5,000 years ago, we didn't understand how the body functions, how life evolves, how planets form, why there are seasons, and many more natural phenomena. But guess what, we eventually found out that these things occur naturally! Therefore it is not surprising to imagine that this trend might continue into the future, as we will continue to learn more about the nature of the Universe. In fact it would be foolish to not leave open the possibility that there are and will be natural phenomena we do not fully understand. Conversely, it would be extremely surprising to accept that the Universe behaves supernaturally, because this is contrary to every piece of information we know about the Universe. There has not been a single piece of evidence to show us that supernaturalism affects our Universe. YES, I understand that this does not mean that supernaturalism does not exist! However, it is far more foolish to equate the possibility of an entirely different interpretation of the Universe that has no evidence for it whatsoever with the idea that we simply don't know everything about how nature works.\n \n6) I DO demand the mechanism when I say we don't know the natural cause yet. I think I spotted the confusion, though. I demand there to be a mechanism that we do not understand. And yes, in the fairy situation I also demand there to be a mechanism that we do not understand. In both situation there is a mechanism that we do not understand. Therefore, I am not rejecting either idea on the basis of there being a mechanism that we do not understand. What distinguishes the fairy situation is that the mechanism that we do not understand is *contrary* to all of our observations of the Universe. The natural mechanism that we do not understand is not contrary to all of our observations of the Universe. Therefore it is far more plausible that the natural mechanism that is not contrary to our observations of the Universe is true, rather than the supernatural mechanism that is completely contrary to our observations of the Universe. \n\n7) No. This is confusing correlation with causation. Take an entire class of freshman and make ALL of them walk through the tower. Let's also assume that there has never in history been an entire freshman class to have taken 5 years to graduate. Now, if literally 100% of those freshmen take 5 years to graduate, then it is an indication of the *plausibility* that a causal relationship exists between walking under the tower and taking an extra year to graduate.\n\n8) Again, of course that doesn't mean there is absolutely no supernatural causation. That's not the point. The goal is to weigh the probability of each option and then make our decision based upon which option is more probable. But why in the world would one believe that instead of there being an unknown natural cause, as there has been countless number of times throughout humanity's progression, there exists instead a cause that is dependent upon a principle that has no evidence of even existing. In the end what it comes down to is weighing the probability of a natural explanation, which is highly probable considering this has been the outcome of LITERALLY every piece of information humanity has ever obtained, with the probability of a supernatural explanation, which is highly improbable considering there is no evidence of such a phenomenon even existing. \n", "prompt": "RationalHeretic23: CMV: Superstition is false\nI reject the idea of superstition because there is no way in which the proposed cause(e.g. wearing lucky underwear) can bring about the effect(e.g. winning a football game).\n\nMy problem with superstition is that it fails to account for the principle of causality.

All dogs have this involuntary response, but it\u2019s much more apparent in some dogs because of fur length.\n\nThese are some common misconceptions about dog body language but this really just scratches the surface. Take the time to learn about how dogs communicate, even if you don\u2019t have a dog...you\u2019ll have friends or family who are dog owners and this will help you interact with any dog you may meet!\nsouthsamurai: Tbh, the single most important rule  about interacting with a dog is to not do it with one you don't already know.\n\nIf they have a human, that's where you communicate first. Not only is it safer for you with that dog, you'll not make the human mad; humans are far more dangerous than dogs.\n\nIf the dog isn't with a human, you should leave it alone until and unless it approaches you. If and when it does, *then* attempt to determine what mood it's in. If you can't, slowly walk away. If you just aren't sure, and aren't willing to accept the possible risks, slowly walk away. \n\nLearning to speak dog isn't *hard*, but it does require access to multiple dogs across breeds. As OP said, all of the obvious signs can vary in presentation by breed. Since individual behaviors can also be misread sometimes, the larger the pool of \"training\" dogs you have access to, the less likely you are to be confused by breed/size/health/peculiarity. \n\nAs OP pointed out, dogspeak is whole body. It isn't just one aspect of their presentation, it's the whole dog that communicates. The difference between an excited greeting and a  nervous greeting just isn't obvious at first glance because they're *almost* the same visually. It doesn't help that the dog's breed can change their movements enough from others to make detecting that difference harder.\n\nBut this is one of those rare YSK posts that really does deliver! Great info that could well help both dogs and people.\nSALAMI-BOI: how do i tell if a dog is happy?\nsouthsamurai: Happy? There's food going down their throat :)\n\nTail: sort of moving circular if they're greeting their human. Otherwise side to side *usually*, and with the right side being a slightly stronger movement. It would be held roughly in line with their spine, or slightly lower *if* the breed has a typical slightly curved tail. Something with a \"curled\" tail would be higher and harder to detect the relaxed state. Some breeds just naturally default to a lower tail position than average (sight hounds often, and \"runners\" like greyhounds and some herding breeds)\n\nThe overall posture would be relaxed. Neither tense and leaned forward, nor withdrawing or cowering. If the dog knows you, a belly display usually indicates an openness to contact, if the dog isn't familiar with you, it *might* indicate being nervous about you. \n\nThe face should be relaxed, probably with an open mouth. The tongue is likely to be loose and may \"loll\" as the dog moves. You might get the impression of a smile.\n\nThe eyes will likely be relaxed, almost drowsy looking if they were human. If you see the whites of their eyes, they aren't happy at all.\n\nThe ears, if not on a breed with  upright ears, will be relaxed totally. With upright breeds, they stay neutral. Neither pricked, nor reclined, and not to the sides or drawn back.\n\nSee what I meant? A lot of that is going to look different on different breeds. A sharpei always has droopy eyes. Chows have tails that aren't as easy to read. Whippets and greyhounds have a low neutral tail position, so they often look nervous or unusually submissive even when they're not. Bulldogs are hard to read in general, and if their tail is docked, it's even harder. \n\nOne of the few signs that I've never seen vary is the play bow.

I think, he was mostly apologizing for all the anti-semetic, anti-muslim posts they discovered that he had been posting to the_donald. That's what he is ashamed of, and frankly it's refreshing to know that someone from the_donald is actually ashamed of the hateful things they said, even if it's only after the entire nation heard about them being a hatefilled asshole.\n\nThe_donald is a place where thousands of trump supporters can sit quietly on their computers and share hateful, racist, sexist, bigoted speech with one another and praise the 'glory' of their 'god-emperor'. Its a place where guns, and the first amendment are people's main political concerns. \n\nAnd now we have the media (one of the things this group openly criticizes) trying to expose who one of these users is (this person who talks about the power of free speech and how we live in a country where you don't have to be afraid to say anything you want).

When in reality the guy willingly released his identity to the press and then ask that they not release it to the public.\n\nIt is my opinion that because the user freely posted those things on a public forum, he might as well had been preaching on a soap box at the corner of time square. The fact that you're on a computer often makes people forget that their identity is never fully concealed, and if you want to exercise free speech you do you must be willing to accept the consequences of those words and actions. \nWrestlingisgood: &gt; Can you elaborate. How is releasing his name a threat? If he published those statement's freely why should he care if his name is published too?\n\nWhy should a woman care if she is found out to have had an abortion? Why should a homosexual care if they are outed to their conservative family. There is a hint of anonymity with reddit whether it is true or not is irrelevant. It is a place where people believe they can be open. Would you want everything you ever posted online and everything you ever said in private to be traced back to you?\n\n&gt;Do you really not think it was because he was ashamed of what he had said and posted? You write like CNN was literally holding a gun to his head, like his identity being released would put his life in danger. \n\nAnita Sarkesian got death and rape threats over what she said about VIDEO GAMES, imagine what harassment this person could face. He did not willingly release his name to the press, they hunted him down, facebook and reddit stalked him and then sent him an E-mail and he begged that they not release his name, to which they said \"CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change\" if that is not a veiled threat I don't know what is. \n\nCNN even admits that he is a private citizen. It isn't exactly newsworthy when a private citizen says something stupid\n\n&gt;It is my opinion that because the user freely posted those things on a public forum, he might as well had been preaching on a soap box at the corner of time square. \n\nDoctors have to register their addresses, do you feel like it is acceptable to have a website where abortion doctors names, phone numbers and addresses are specifically targeted? What if I posted the names of every grinder user and outed them as homosexual? Was it ok when the KKK published the names of blacks who registered to vote so that people could attack those black people?\n\n\n&gt; The fact that you're on a computer often makes people forget that their identity is never fully concealed, and if you want to exercise free speech you do you must be willing to accept the consequences of those words and actions.\n\nOf course. But doxxing is dangerous. Usually one assumes the consequences to be a downvote or at very worst a private citizen finding their ID. No one expects a multibillion dollar corporation to use their massive following to silence a critic by basically implying that if they ever make fun of CNN or post something not PC again that they will dox them. \nKirkaine: &gt; Anita Sarkesian got death and rape threats over what she said about VIDEO GAMES\n\nGlad we agree that was bad.\n\nDo you think she would have gotten fewer rape threats if the names of everyone who threatened her were made public?\nabsloan12: Exactly my point!! Thanks, u/kirkaine.\n\nIf the user's name was revealed and then suddenly started receiving death threats, wouldn't you think those threats would stop pretty quickly if their identities were threatened to be revealed?\n\nIt's a viscous cycle, but a cycle none the less. Ending hateful \"free speech\" will end the hateful responses that follow.\nWrestlingisgood: I don't know, but I can assure you those people would have gotten threats. \n\nI want to clarify, that no one threatened anyone in this situation. Hansolo did not threaten anyone at all. \n\nBut more to the point, should Anita have held her tounge because she may be threatened? \nKirkaine: &gt;Hansolo did not threaten anyone at all\n\nHe explicitly called for genocide.\n\nAnita shouldn't have held her toungue, and she didn't. She published everything under her own name, no doxxing necessary. Her position doesn't change if doxxing were to disappear off the face of the Earth.\n\nLet's get back to the rape threats for a moment. Let's say that Anita were to publish the details of everyone who sent her rape threats (and was perfectly up front that she would do so, yet people did it anyway). Do you think it's unconscionable that those abusers should face consequences for their actions?\nWrestlingisgood: &gt;He explicitly called for genocide.\n\nProof? \n\n&gt;Anita shouldn't have held her toungue, and she didn't. She published everything under her own name, no doxxing necessary. Her position doesn't change if doxxing were to disappear off the face of the Earth.\n\nAnd she received death and rape threats. Should a woman only be able to publish an opinion if she is willing to deal with \"STFU BITCH ILL KILL YOU\" every time she logs on to twitter?\n\n&gt;Let's get back to the rape threats for a moment. Let's say that Anita were to publish the details of everyone who sent her rape threats (and was perfectly up front that she would do so, yet people did it anyway). Do you think it's unconscionable that those abusers should face consequences for their actions?\n\nWell first of all you will never be able to do that, second what would be an appeals process since this seems like a guilty before innocence type of thing, and lastly, yea it would reduce it, but people would find a new way to hide it. \n\nAnonymity is a two sided sword, I get that. \nKirkaine: &gt;[\u201c500,000 dead Muslims is a good start. Kill the rest and I\u2019ll be impressed. Good keep up the good work until the last Islamic piece of shit is wiped from the planet.\u201d](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/03/trump-tweet-reddit-user-history-hanassholesolo)\n\nShe shouldn't. *But you don't have a plan to change that, because you're simply advocating for the status quo*. Publicly outing abusers is the only policy that I can think of that has a chance at stopping them. This is based on the way we enforce literally everything else in society, by making people face the consequences of their actions.\n\nThis isn't a \"guilty before innocence type of thing\", becuase this isn't a court. Publishing information doesn't have guilt or innocence attached. If false claims are made, we already have a robust libel system to deal with that.\n\nI'll note, you still haven't answered my question. Regardless of how it would be implemented, regardless of the effect it would have on future abuse, do you think these abusers have an inherent right to make their threats anonymously and do you think that it would be immoral to publish their identities, however robust responsible the process is?\nWrestlingisgood: Ok so he is a prick, he is still a private citizen \n\nYou seem to be saying that it is ok to send people death and rape threats as long as you out them and they get death and rape threats too?\n\nI am not proposing a solution but I am saying the reaction is too extreme, doxxing leads to harassment no matter what the issue. Targeting someone for harassment is not a solution to a person giving an unpopular opinion\n", "prompt": "absloan12: CMV: CNN did not blackmail u/hanassholesolo, but instead they helped him by threatening to release his identity.\nLet me just start off by saying I don't think u/hanassholesolo's apology was really about the post of Trump body-slamming CNN, sure he mentions it but I don't think that was the reason he felt compelled to issue an apology.

{"full_text": "NeoPlatonist: Maverick Philosopher: Against Terminological Mischief: 'Negative Atheism' and 'Negative Nominalism'\n\nStyx92: I think the underlying issue is that people think atheism and anti-theism are the same thing. Atheism can be proprietary (it might seem ridiculous, but tire irons and cabbages could be classified as atheists just as much as they could be classified as non-voters, as /u/semantical pointed out). The statement, \"I am an atheist\" doesn't say much, and it isn't supposed to. Atheism isn't a type of philosophy, it's just a statement. Like pointing out the color of someone's hair, all you are doing is saying, \"I don't believe that any deities exist\". The same is true for theism; being theist doesn't automatically mean you're of one certain school of religious thought (despite what the author of the article might say), it just means you believe in one or more deities.\nNeoPlatonist: A tire-iron lacks belief in God, so it is an atheist. But a tire-iron also lacks disbelief in God, so it is also a theist. This is absurd.\nOxiris: Disbelieve = not believe\n\nWhen you lack belief, you are not believing (disbelief).\n\nWhat you are saying is that a tire-iron lacks 'not believing'. But that is what it is doing, **not believing**, how can it lack it?\nNeoPlatonist: a tire iron has no agency. it cannot 'do' anything. it lacks not believing because it cannot not believe.\nOxiris: SO basically what you are saying, is that because a rock has no agency it can perform logical fallacies.\n\n&gt; it lacks not believing because it **cannot not believe**.\n\nlacking **not believing** means that ALL that they can do is believe.\n\nSo, let's use this same logic...\n\nA rock has no agency, it cannot 'do' anything. It lacks 'not moving' because it cannot not move.\n\nSo, when I see a rock, just sitting there, standing still, **not moving**... no, it is not doing that, it is not not moving because rocks can't move.\n\nBecause it cannot believe, it lacks the ability to believe, and therefore it lacks belief in anything.\n\nBecause it cannot move on its own, it lacks self mobility.\n\nBut this is just a pointless discussion.\n\nWhat I am trying to make you see, is your wrong usage of the word 'disbelief'... that lots of people seem to have here.\n\nDisbelief does not mean belief of the contrary.\nNeoPlatonist: &gt;Disbelief does not mean belief of the contrary.\n\nwith respect to a binary distinction, yes it does. p || ~p\n\nwhatever you are trying to argue with your continued focus on rocks is irrelevant to the point, which is identity claims. to be an atheist is to make an identity claim. disbelief in p entails belief in ~p.\n\n\nOxiris: &gt; *Disbelief does not mean belief of the contrary.*\n&gt; with respect to a binary distinction, yes it does. p || ~p\n\nAnd this is **exactly** what I mean. You are using such binary logic inappropriately.\n\n**This** is how you would write what you are trying to interpret:\n\n- P = belief in the existence of God(s)\n\n- ~P = belief in the non-existence of God(s)\n\nnot believing = disbelieving\n\n- Theists believe P.\n\n- Atheists **do not believe P**.\n\n- Agnostics **do not believe P** and **do not believe ~P**.\n\nDisbelieving does not mean believing the contrary, if it did, agnostics would believe god didn't exist as well, because they also **do not believe** in the existence of god(s)... if they did, they'd be theists.\nNeoPlatonist: your analysis of agnostic is incorrect. it is not that \"Agnostics do not believe P and do not believe ~P.\" for that would be a contradiction. agnostics simply believe that it cannot be known whether p or ~p.\nOxiris: Uhh, that is the definition:\n\n- [one who is **not committed to believing** in either the existence or the nonexistence of God or a god](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic)\n\nBut a contradiction would be if:\n\n- Agnostics **believe P** and **do not believe P**.\n\n&gt; agnostics simply believe that it cannot be known whether p or ~p.\n\nThat is irrelevant... you are putting forward a different belief that has nothing to do with the discussion.\n\nThe question at hand was the belief or lack of belief agnostics have in regards to the existence of god, not if they believe if it can be known, or if they believe if god's favorite color is blue or not blue, etc.\n\nThere is a **reason** why a synonym for agnostic is disbeliever:\n\n[a person who holds that the existence of the ultimate cause, as God, and the essential nature of things are unknown and unknowable, or that human knowledge is limited to experience. Synonyms: **disbeliever**, nonbeliever, unbeliever; doubter, skeptic, secularist, empiricist; heathen, heretic, infidel, pagan.](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agnostic?s=t)\n\n\nNeoPlatonist: if we are going to play the dictionary game lets at least use the full definition\n\n1 : a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably ; broadly : one who is not committed to believing in either the existence or the of God or a god 2 : a person who is unwilling to commit to an opinion about something &lt;political agnostics&gt;\n\nas I said: an agnostic believes (holds the view) that it cannot be known (or is unknown) whether p or ~p.\n\nwe are talking about agnostics because you misrepresented their beliefs. they do not believe p and ~p, they believe it cannot be known whether p or ~p. this is fundamental logic, nothing fishy going on here. theists and atheists do believe that it can be known whether p or ~p, and they believe p and ~p, respectively.\nOxiris: It is impossible to have a reasonable discussion with you:\n\n&gt; 1 : a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably ; broadly : **one who is not committed to believing in either the existence or the of God or a god** 2 : a person who is unwilling to commit to an opinion about something &lt;political agnostics&gt;\n\nOne who is not committed to believe, **DOES NOT BELIEVE**.\n\nIf you were correct, **disbeliever** would not be a synonym for agnostic, yet it is.\nNeoPlatonist: You are showing an incredible misconception of what a synonym is, first of all.\n\nSecond, your selective reading of that definition to match your cognitive bias does you no good. an agnostic is 'not committed to believing in either the existence or nonexistence of a God' why? He is not committed because he believes it cannot be known whether p or ~p. If he did believe it could be known whether p or ~p, then he would believe p or ~p. Believing both or neither is a contradiction. One must believe p or ~p, or believe that it cannot be known whether p or ~p - this exhausts all logical possibilities.\nOxiris: &gt; You are showing an incredible misconception of what a synonym is, first of all.\n\n**synonym** - [a word having the same or nearly the same meaning as another in the language](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/synonym?s=t)\n\nSo, since I have a misconception of what a synonym is... please do tell, what are they, and **WHY** is agnostic synonymous with disbeliever. I would love to hear it. :-)\n\n&gt; Second, your selective reading of that definition to match your cognitive bias does you no good.\n\nOh my, your projection is so high now, it is as if you are talking in a mirror... seriously.\n\n&gt; an agnostic is 'not committed to believing in either the existence or nonexistence of a God' why?\n\nThe irony here is that, you are reading into that to match your cognitive bias...\n\nImagine a subscription to the Time magazine. If **YOU** are not committed to a subscription with Time magazine, are you a subscriber? **NO**!\n\nYou are **ignoring** the part where it mentions that an agnostic is not committed, but instead, want to add your own 2\u00a2 into the definition like, \" *...definition...* the definition does not matter, but what matters is WHY is definition defined that way. I'll tell you why!\"\n\n&gt; Believing both or neither is a contradiction.\n\nBelieving both (P and ~P) is a contradiction.\n\nBelieving neither (P and ~P) is not a contradiction.\n\nNeoPlatonist: Among the other terms you listed as \"synonymous\" with agnostic there includes empiricist and pagan. You are very confused if you think disbeliever and agnostic mean the same thing or that we have a whole host of words that have the same meaning. As the definition of synonym states, it is a word with the same or a similar meaning. Similar seems to be the part you are missing. Synonyms have subtle differences, especially when used in different contexts, which is especially relevant to the matter we are discussing. So when you point angrily at a thesaurus as if it is some arbiter of meaning then you look pretty silly, ridiculous even.\n\nThe rest of your post borders on trolling. Your Time magazine argument is particularly incomprehensible. Slow down and retrace your thoughts.\n\nAnd if you believe that you can know whether p or ~p, then not believing p and ~p certainly is a contradiction, and a performative one at that!\nOxiris: &gt; Among the other terms you listed as \"synonymous\" with agnostic there includes empiricist and pagan.\n\n**pagan** - a person who is not a Christian, Jew, or Muslim. Synonyms: heathen, gentile; idolator; nonbeliever. \n\nIs an agnostic a christian, jew or muslim? If he was, he'd be a theist. This is common sense.\n\n**empiricist**, an agnostic depends on empirical method to not commit to believing in P nor ~P, as opposed to believing P on faith.\n\n&gt; You are very confused if you think disbeliever and agnostic mean the same thing or that we have a whole host of words that have the same meaning.\n\nUh, no, that is not what I said. It is weird that you have to go to those extremes to try to disprove my point.\n\nSynonymous words are different words, but within a specific context they convey the same meaning.\n\nFor example, in the context of what an agnostic believes, he is a disbeliever. In the context on why an agnostic disbelieves, it is because of empiricism. In the context of muslim perspective, he is an infidel, etc.. etc...\n\n&gt; As the definition of synonym states, it is a word with the same or a similar meaning. Similar seems to be the part you are missing.\n\nNot really. But it is interesting how you can read all of this, and in the back of your skull, think that an agnostic is **NOT** same nor similar to the word *disbeliever*. Because in your world they are not even remotely close to a disbeliever. Yet, you read that sentence, and you don't seem to process it.\n\n&gt; The rest of your post borders on trolling. Your Time magazine argument is particularly incomprehensible. Slow down and retrace your thoughts.\n\nI apologize if using reason and logic and trying to make you think is trolling you.\n\nThe subscriber argument is basically that there are only 2 types, subscribers and non-subscribers. If you don't know if you should subscribe does not make you a subscriber. What makes you a subscriber is if you subscriber. So, non-subscribers and people that are think about subscribing are BOTH non-subscribers.\n\nBelievers subscribe to a god. If agnostics had a subscription, they'd be theists, since they do not, they are non-subscribers.\n\n&gt; And if you believe that you can know whether p or ~p, then not believing p and ~p certainly is a contradiction, and a performative one at that!\n\nI am not talking about knowing. That just creates confusion, which is something you are really good a creating.\n\nP = belief in the existence of god(s) {NOT KNOWLEDGE}\n~P = belief in the non-existence of god(s) {NOT KNOWLEDGE}\n\n- Agnostics do not commit to P, nor do they commit to ~P.\n\nOr better yet:\n\n- Agnostics do not subscribe to P, nor do they subscribe to ~P.\n\n- Theists subscribe to P.\n\n- Atheists lack subscription to P.\n\nWow, what do you know, both atheists and agnostics lack subscription to P.\nNeoPlatonist: You are still missing the point, and I'm not going to bother explaining it to you again. If you care to reread what I wrote and let it sink in, then you'll understand everything you just wrote is quite silly.\nOxiris: Right. Because in your world, the word synonym exists, but it doesn't mean anything, and they have nothing to do with the words they are synonymous to... for example agnostic and disbeliever. Gotcha!\nNeoPlatonist: i never said that.\nOxiris: Then tell, instead of avoiding of giving a direct answer. **Why is disbeliever a synonym for agnostic?**\n\nTo answer that question correctly, you'd have to consider some of the problems in your logic:\n\n- 1) You don't understand the difference between **\"believe in not A\"** versus **\"not believe in A\"**\n\n- 2) disbelieve does not mean **belief of the contrary position\". (reason why you have trouble understanding #1)\n\nIf a group of scientists review a well written hypothesis, but there is no evidence yet to back such hypothesis, the scientific board will have to withhold belief. They at the current moment would not be believing in the theory. This is what it means to disbelieve. This in no way means that they believe that the hypothesis is false. But I guess it is no use, you weren't able to grasp it then, you are not now.\nNeoPlatonist: Listen, you've already won the award for worst argument in the world. I have no idea what your obsession with synonyms is about. You've even misrepresented my position on them when I was quite clear. I can't even fathom what your sticking point on them is. Why is disbelieve a synonym for agnostic? Because Roget fucking wrote it in his fucking book? As I have said, an agnostic does not believe we can know whether there is or is not a God - in that sense, he is a 'disbeliever'. He is also a  'disbeliever' if we word it \"an agnostic believes we cannot know whether there is or is not a God\" because in neither case does he believe in God, whether he 'believes we cannot know' or 'does not believe we can know - in both cases he still does not believe in God, which is why when a theist looks at an agnostic he calls him a disbeliever.\n\nIt seems your whole trivial argument boils down your belief that 'to believe' is to actively do something (what? I don't know, have neurons in a certain configuration? take one side of an argument and not the other?) while 'to not believe' is to not really do anything (even though yes your neurons are in some other certain configuration and yes you take the other side of an argument) and hey I can't be criticized for not believing p but I could be criticized for believing ~p why because I say so and thesaurus and faq and dictionary and mumblejumble evidence. It is just **fucking stupid**, bro. Just a tsunami of stupidity.\n\n&gt;1) You don't understand the difference between \"believe in not A\" versus \"not believe in A\"\n\nThere is no difference. Explain to me what a 'belief' actually is? Explain to me what it means \"to believe\" something. To take one side in an argument and not another? Do you even Moore's paradox?\n\nDisbelief certainly does mean belief of the contrary position when not believing the contrary entails a contradiction. You might not *say* you believe it, and you might construct ridiculous belief taxonomies to defend your irrational position, but this is simply delusion. If you go outside in the rain and say \"I don't believe it is not raining.\" well *of course* you believe it *is* raining. If you then add, \"I also don't believe that it is raining\" then you are clearly delusional. \n\n&gt;This in no way means that they believe that the hypothesis is false.\n\nOf course it does. They believe the hypothesis is false until it is proven. All hypothesis are considered false until they are proven. And even if it is proven they still hold that it could be proven false again by future evidence. None of this prevents people from trying to prove the hypothesis. You can believe something is false and still try to prove it.\n\nOh yeah and here you go:\n\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agnostic?s=t\n\nSynonym Study\nAgnostic, atheist, infidel, skeptic  refer to persons not inclined toward religious belief or a particular form of religious belief. An agnostic  is one who believes it impossible to know anything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine. An atheist  is one who denies the existence of a deity or of divine beings. Infidel  means an unbeliever, especially a nonbeliever in Islam or Christianity. A skeptic  doubts and is critical of all accepted doctrines and creeds. \nOxiris: &gt; Listen, you've already won the award for worst argument in the world. \n\nWe'll get back to this...\n\n&gt; I have no idea what your obsession with synonyms is about. You've even misrepresented my position on them when I was quite clear. I can't even fathom what your sticking point on them is. \n\nI'm not sticking to them, but what is your obsession that I am sticking to them? It's like you are afraid to be proven wrong, and want to quickly change the subject.\n\n&gt; As I have said, an agnostic does not believe we can know whether there is or is not a God - in that sense, he is a 'disbeliever'. He is also a 'disbeliever' if we word it \"an agnostic believes we cannot know whether there is or is not a God\" because in neither case does he believe in God, whether he 'believes we cannot know' or 'does not believe we can know - in both cases he still does not believe in God, which is why when a theist looks at an agnostic he calls him a disbeliever.\n\nFinally, some logic and reason came out of you.\n\n&gt; in both cases he still **does not** believe in God\n\nBut it is not about both cases though, only **one** case allows for the possibility to believe in god.\n\nBut anyway, disbelieve is to NOT BELIEVE, so what you really said is **in both cases he (an agnostic) disbelieves in God**.\n\nOk, let's continue.\n\n&gt; It seems your whole trivial argument boils down your belief that 'to believe' is to actively do something (what? I don't know, have neurons in a certain configuration? take one side of an argument and not the other?) while 'to not believe' is to not really do anything (even though yes your neurons are in some other certain configuration and yes you take the other side of an argument) and hey I can't be criticized for not believing p but I could be criticized for believing ~p why because I say so and thesaurus and faq and dictionary and mumblejumble evidence. It is just fucking stupid, bro. Just a tsunami of stupidity.\n\nThis nonsense that you are babbling about neurons is irrelevant.\n\nThe thesaurus forced you to acknowledge that **in both cases an agnostics disbelieves in God**. That statement has nothing to do with believing in ~P, nor has it any relevance to a thesaurus.\n\n&gt;    *1) You don't understand the difference between \"believe in not A\" versus \"not believe in A\"*\n&gt;\n&gt;There is no difference. Explain to me what a 'belief' actually is? Explain to me what it means \"to believe\" something. To take one side in an argument and not another? Do you even Moore's paradox?\n\n**{Facepalm}** I thought we were making progress.\n\nDo you want to know what belief actually is... it is a **subjective opinion**.\n\n- 1) Not have an opinion about P\n\n**is not the same as**\n\n- 2) Have an opinion about **NOT** P\n\n&gt; Disbelief certainly does mean belief of the contrary position when not believing the contrary entails a contradiction. You might not say you believe it, and you might construct ridiculous belief taxonomies to defend your irrational position, but this is simply delusion.\n\n**{Facepalm}** again!\n\nYour own **Fxxxing** words: **in both cases an agnostic disbelieves in God**\n\nSo, your stance is that an agnostic disbelieves in god(s), and that disbelief is belief to the contrary. So an agnostic believes that god does not exist?\n\nBut no, your misinterpretation of language and logic because of your bias towards how you interpret agnosticism, makes you see that agnosticism floating in limbo between belief and disbelief while an agnostic **disbelieves** as well.\n\nAn atheist disbelieves, you categorize them as believers that gods do not exist (which is illogical). Agnostics disbelieve in the same manner as atheists, but you somehow view them as though they do not disbelieve. This is some mental mind fnck! It kind of reminds me along the lines of christian indoctrination where logic can't penetrate.\n\nThe point is that atheists lack belief in the existence of god(s), and their disbelief does not equate to belief in the non-existence of god(s). And agnostic also lacks belief in the existence of god(s), and their disbelief does not equate to belief in the non-existence of god(s) either. \n\n&gt; If you go outside in the rain and say \"I don't believe it is not raining.\" well of course you believe it is raining. If you then add, \"I also don't believe that it is raining\" then you are clearly delusional.\n\nThis has nothing to do with Moore's Paradox\n\n- 1) It is raining outside **&lt;-- this is a Fncking FACT**\n\n- 2) If you go outside in the factual rain, and say that you believe it is not raining, it is belief contrary to a fact\n\nVersus:\n\n- 1) God exists **&lt;-- this is NOT a Fncking FACT**\n\n- 2) Saying that god is not a fact is NOT belief contrary to a fact, and neither is not believing in god because it is not a fact\n\n&gt; Listen, you've already won the award for worst argument in the world. \n\nYes, you who acknowledges that \n\n- 1) an agnostic is someone who disbelieves in god(s).\n\n- 2) Disbelieving means believing in the contrary, which would make an agnostic someone who believes in the non-existence of god(s) based on #1\n\n- 3) Does not understand the difference between **not having an opinion of P** does not equate to **having an opinion of ~P**\n\nYour entire argument consists of all those three.\n", "prompt": "NeoPlatonist: Maverick Philosopher: Against Terminological Mischief: 'Negative Atheism' and 'Negative Nominalism'\n\nStyx92: I think the underlying issue is that people think atheism and anti-theism are the same thing.

I also didn't make it up. I call these things you are saying \"usage of bad arguments\".\n21MushroomCupcakes: You definitely are posing some bad arguments, that's for sure.\nSennahoj12345: I am saying that people don't need conversion therapy, they need to accept Jesus' forgiveness. All of us do because we all sin in one way or another. Therefore conversion therapy should have ended earlier because even if it would have worked, they would've needed Jesus' forgiveness anyway.\n21MushroomCupcakes: Yeah, we all know what your position is, it's nothing new.

Going by your track record so far, I'm not holding my breath.\nNo_Temperature_1342: You presumably have heard 'unmoved mover'? First cause? A teological argument?\n\nThe catholic monks have heard every argument there is over 2k years. Special pleading it is not.\n21MushroomCupcakes: Those three arguments are absolutely special pleading.\n\n\"Everything in the universe follows certain rules, except for [insert god], because he's exempt.\"\n\n2k years and I'm still unimpressed.\nNo_Temperature_1342: They are arguments for the existence of god primarily, not a study of his \"special powers\" or \"exemption from naturalism\". There is no special pleading there, just logical arguments. \n\nIf you want a God that explains the rules of the universe, catholic theology can get you there. Science and natural philosophy was borne out of the religious and philosophical orders. A first cause or unmoved mover can lead to abstract concepts that become what you already know. \n\nGod's unknown nature above the universe and science is not ignoring the 'rules of the universe', it's an attempt to explain them logically from the top down.\n\nI think you made 'special pleading' and legalism your highest value and it replaced God for you.\n21MushroomCupcakes: Ah, just a bunch of begging the question and presuming my thoughts and intent.\n\nThe ego to tell somebody you've never met or really conversed with what their \"highest value\" is.\n\nExplanations operate from the bottom, up. This is just presumptionalist apologetics.\n\nAnd again, nothing I've never heard before. You guys need some new arguments.\nNo_Temperature_1342: You think a rhetorical argument in a debate is presuming your thoughts and intent, then assert my ego is at play?\n\nIt's a debate about religion, it is literally about what your highest value is.\n\nYour highest value is also what you hold dear at the bottom of reality. We can explain from the top down and the bottom up at the same time with Christ. It usually takes some knowledge of philosophy, theology or symbols before people get that. \n\nYou didn't address the argument, you just rudely assumed you were above it without engaging in it. Dismissive - as you consistently have been - to a topic where you demonstrate your own ignorance.\n\nSo I again repeat, first cause, or unmoved mover are valid logical arguments for God and don't dodge the question or handwave away the point. You have not supplied a valid reason to dismiss those as a cause to believe in a God.\n21MushroomCupcakes: I don't need a reason to not believe something, we call this Burden of Proof. I literally have no reason to believe any of it, thus I don't.\n\nIf you claim to have a pet manticore in your garage, I'm free to dismiss it, without evidence, until such time manticores show up in zoological taxonomy.\n\nRepeating yourself doesn't make your point more valid, it just demonstrates a lack of reason, objectivity, and a willful unwillingness to deconstruct your own position.\n\nIf I say, \"you drank the Kool-Aid,\" what's not going to convince me is telling me how much you like the flavor.\nNo_Temperature_1342: The argument I put forward is exactly the argument needed to fulfill the Burden of Proof, a debate requirement you kindly but needlessly restated for us.\n\nSo go ahead, show me logically why a first cause could not exist. You do know the argument right? That all things must have a cause and one cause must logically be the first one? Or were you just making it up that you knew it?\n\nIt is not a mythological argument, it is a purely rational one. You may dismiss a manticore all you like, you brought that into the conversation yourself, I was not asking you that.\n\nYou have been given 4 chances to engage and you just won't. So I will dismiss you like you have God. You are behaving exactly like someone who wants special pleading to excuse and recuse themselves from addressing God, and to rest in undue ignorance.\n\nSo have it, but know it is you, who is doing the special pleading. \n\nMy source for posterity's sake is: the Five Ways, by Thomas Aquanis. A catholic monk from 1250 who posited three of the arguments I presented to you. It's easily found on google, for anyone reading.\n21MushroomCupcakes: You didn't prove shit, and my not posing a counter-argument doesn't change that. Again, shifting the burden of proof.\n\nYou are obviously and blatantly projecting your argument's fallacies on me because I'm not accommodating your contrived and uncompelling script.\n\nI know you keep saying it, but something isn't \"rational\" or \"logical\" just because you insist on it. There's structure, form, and etiquette when using these formally, and I'm not seeing it. Where's your null hypothesis?

I don't have a whole lot of space in the garden and the shed is a unique design. The shed will be one side a shed and the other side a greenhouse, with a single shared wall and shared roof. The shed-side will have a normal shingled roof, the greenhouse-side will have a plastic roof to allow in light. \n\nHere is a straight on view: [https://imgur.com/8MuMgTc](https://imgur.com/8MuMgTc) the main shed-side on the left, greenhouse-side on the right\n\nSlightly angled view showing the shared wall and more framing: [https://imgur.com/ovT9rD9](https://imgur.com/ovT9rD9)\n\nBirds-eye view showing rafters:  [https://imgur.com/qeUWOfI](https://imgur.com/qeUWOfI) \n\nThe greenhouse door I have not headered because the door will be very light and made from a few timbers and plastic. Greenhouse will be light-weight plastic, not glass. Foundation will be a 4 inch concrete slab, with 4 or 5 inches of compacted gravel underneath. \n\nCan anyone more experience than myself have a look over and tell me if anything obvious is sticking out that would be a hazard. I don't want it to be bomb proof, but I also don't want it to fall over in the first big wind. I live in the UK, we get very mild frost/hot seasons and we don't get any torrential gales or anything like that. \n\nMy only major worry is that the rafters would press outwards onto the side walls and over time may push them away from the central wall. I'm going to double top-plate the shed and I will also add two thicker beams horizontally tied in with Simpson Ties to brace the side walls and hopefully prevent push out. \n\nDimensions are approx. 11.8 foot x 10.2 foot, with roughly 4 foot being the greenhouse-side. Height at the highest point is roughly 11 foot, roughly 7.8 foot at the eaves.\njaproct: Your base plan seem ok, but I have a couple of modifications I would make. First off, there is no reason to be using posts in this framing at all. They add no strength that you could jot get out of doubling up studs or making channels or corners out of the same wall studs. Birdsmouth cuts in the rafters at the bottom with blocking between them will be pleanty rigid and secure. For simon ties, use standard hurricane clips or better yet, use what is called a \"birds mouth\" rafter tie. Its overkill, but that roof will never blow off. Lastly, when you pour the concrete, snap a wet line on all four sides denoting the wall centers. On this line, sink some foundation bolts into the concrete for secure anchoring. 2 on every wall is pleanty, even overkill for this. Now is also when you want to figure venting also. If you are going to have simple gable vents or soffit and ridge vents you can frame them in to begin with. Good luck.\nbluetack_man: Thank you, that is very helpful! The posts are mostly because I already have them to use and I want to use them for something, are they counter productive? If so then I'll just frame it out using the regular timber, but as long as its not taking away strength then I want to use them. But I am not totally sure on them yet, maybe I will just remove them and replace with regular timbers.\n\nBirdsmouths are the plan for the rafters, and ties as you suggested. I had already planned to insert bolts as you suggested for the concrete, so glad I'm on the right path there! \n\nVentilation I had not planned at all, I'll add some vents at either end of the shed and the greenhouse - thank you for pointing that out!\njaproct: You are more than welcome. I learned when I built my first greenhouse that they get hotter than hell!!!! Bad thing. Wound up having to add them afterwards and it was a real pain. Good luck, ask any questions any time. Also keep a pic diary and post when done. A lot of people want sheds and you can help show that its a good project even for inexperienced people if they plan it well like you have.\nbluetack_man: Yeah I bet it will get roasting in there, good call on the vents. Some of the windows in the greenhouse will be open-able too. I've found a cheapish website that sells decent thickness plastic so I'll make some windows and some simple hinges for this. I love the feeling of planning a big project like this, lots to think about and problem solve.\n\nAnd yes I am very inexperienced!
