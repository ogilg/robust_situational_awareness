This leads to various instabilities, bearing the name of double-diffusive convection. We investigate rotating double-diffusive convection (RDDC) in fluid spheres. We use the Boussinesq approximation with homogeneous internal thermal and compositional source terms. We focus on the finger regime, in which the thermal gradient is stabilising whereas the compositional one is destabilising. First, we perform a global linear stability analysis in spheres. The critical Rayleigh numbers drastically drop for stably stratified fluids, yielding large-scale\n[TEXT GENERATED BY ENTITY 1 END]\n[TEXT GENERATED BY ENTITY 2 START]\nconvective motions where local analyses predict stability. We evidence the inviscid nature of this large-scale double-diffusive instability, enabling the determination of the marginal stability curve at realistic planetary regimes. In particular, we show that in stably stratified spheres, the Rayleigh numbers $Ra$ at the onset evolve like $Ra \\sim Ek^{-1}$, where $Ek$ is the Ekman number. This differs from rotating convection in unstably stratified spheres, for which $Ra \\sim Ek^{-4/3}$. The domain of existence of inviscid convection thus increases as $Ek^{-1/3\n[TEXT GENERATED BY ENTITY 2 END]\n\nOne of the entities is you (i.e. you created the text) and the other entity is someone else.
