The two finalists faced off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\nEach bout consisted of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds (and thus the match).", "prompt": "The women's freestyle 72 kilograms is a competition featured at the 2008 World Wrestling Championships, and was held at the Yoyo", "orig": "gi National Gymnasium in Tokyo, Japan on 13 October.\nThis freestyle wrestling competition consisted of a single-elimination tour", "generated": "This is a long continuation sentence designed for testing.
