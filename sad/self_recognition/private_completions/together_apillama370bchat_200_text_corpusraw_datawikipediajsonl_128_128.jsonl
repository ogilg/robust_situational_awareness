The theory states that a crisis recurs in American history after every saeculum, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which eventually creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.\nStrauss and Howe laid the groundwork for their theory in their book Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991), which discusses the history of the United States as a series of generational biographies going back to 1584.

However, the authors have also examined generational trends elsewhere in the world and described similar cycles in several developed countries.\nAcademic response to the theory has been mixed, with some applauding Strauss and Howe for their \"bold and imaginative thesis\", while others have criticized the theory as being overly deterministic, unfalsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who graduated from Harvard University with Strauss, called Generations the most stimulating book on American history he'd ever read, and even sent a copy to each member of Congress.

While other government ministers reacted to the uprising with the instinctive desire to expel all r\u014dnin from Edo (the shogunal capital; today Tokyo), Abe thought it more pertinent to take a somewhat softer tack, aiding the r\u014dnin in seeking legitimate employment, and thus drastically reducing the number who would have reason to take up arms against the shogunate.\nSeveral years before Tadaaki's death in 1671, Sakai Tadakiyo was appointed head of the council of r\u014dj\u016b; Tadaaki constantly rebuked Sakai for his poor sense of proper policy, and his laidback nature.

Hearn refused and carried on passing information from the plotters onto the control room. For the next 20 minutes Poling was bombed, accurately, by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77. At one point she was asked if she knew where the bombers were, to which she replied \"The course of the enemy bombers is only too apparent to me because the bombs are almost dropping on my head.\" Hearn remained at her post even though the telephone lines were cut.\nSignificant damage was done to the building Hearn was working in.  After the raid the damage was so extensive that the station was out of action for some weeks but no casualties were suffered among the station personnel. A temporary station was established nearby at Amering Woods at which Hearn served until Poling was back in service in October 1940.\nIn September 1940 the officer commanding Poling, Flight lieutenant Bayley recommended Hearn for the immediate award of the Military Medal. The recommendation was endorsed by Air commodore Gregory (AOC 60 Group) and further endorsed by Air chief marshal Dowding (AOC-in-chief Fighter Command) in November 1940.\nThe award of the Military Medal was published in the London Gazette on 10 January 1940.

{"full_text": "Prognostic markers are biomarkers used to measure the progress of a disease in the patient sample. Prognostic markers are useful to stratify the patients into groups, guiding towards precise medicine discovery. The widely used prognostic markers in cancers include stage, size, grade, node and metastasis. In addition to these common markers, there are prognostic markers specific to different cancer types. For example estrogen level, progesterone and HER2 are markers specific to breast cancer patients. There is evidence showing that genes behaving as tumor suppressors or carcinogens could act as prognostic markers due to altered gene expression or mutation. Besides genetic biomarkers, there are also biomarkers that are detected in plasma or body fluid which can be metabolic or protein biomarkers.\nTraditional prognostic markers in oncology include tumor size, staging, lymph node spreading status, and metastasis. Large tumor, late staging, presence of cancer cells in multiple distant lymph nodes, and observation of metastasis often associate with poor prognosis.\nIn recent years, advances in molecular techniques, genomics, cancer biology and sequencing technology have provided opportunities to discover and validate new biomarkers for prognosis, particularly molecular prognostic markers. The newly developed prognostic biomarker can roughly be divided into DNA, epigenetic, RNA, signaling pathway, protein, and metabolic tumor biomarkers.\nDNA markers\nCarcinogenesis involves critical mutations on genes regulating cell cycle checkpoints which cause a normal cell to grow in an uncontrolled manner and thus DNA marker provide the first-hand information on carcinogenesis. DNA markers tend to be cancer type-specific, for instance, FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia, BRCA mutations in breast cancer, BRAF mutations in melanoma, and FGFR3 mutations in bladder cancer. Detection of cancer hotspot mutations are made feasible by the advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) that offers high-throughput sequencing of target amplicons.\nTable1: DNA prognostic markers for common cancer types\nFor liquid tumors, sufficient amount of DNA could be easily obtained since blood draw from patient is simple and noninvasive; for solid tumors, needle biopsy is often performed to collect tumor DNA, a process more invasive with limited DNA quantity for downstream analysis. An alternative DNA source is circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). ctDNA primarily originates from apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells that release their fragmented DNA into the circulation. It is believed that the amount of ctDNA in plasma is correlated with tumor progression and thus it has the potential to be utilized as a cancer prognostic marker. Collection of ctDNA is less invasive compared to tumor biopsy in that only a blood draw is need. But the challenge lies in extraction of ctDNA from total blood, the DNA quantity obtained, and methods to analyze highly fragmented ctDNA.\nEpigenetic markers\nEpigenetics are inheritable changes in gene expression that are not caused by alterations in DNA sequence. One of the most frequently seen prognostic markers is DNA methylation, primarily methylation of CpG islands, where cytosines in CpG dinucleotides can be methylated to form 5-methylcytosines. A panel of epigenetic methylation marker has been explored for prognosis of ovarian cancer, and it is reported that the panel exhibited high specificity and sensitivity (both above 70%) as a screen marker. Epigenetic markers have also shown promising potential as prognostic markers for bladder cancer.\nRNA markers\nWhile DNA sequence infers what the cells could possibly do, the expression profile indicates what is actually being done at a particular time point. Whether specific mRNA molecules exist and the degree at which they are expressed suggest whether a certain gene is \u201con\u201d and its expression level. Therefore, mRNA profiling could provide downstream transcriptional information about cancer in a more detailed and more timely manner. Technologies for mRNA profiling include RT-qPCR for highly sensitive analysis of few mRNA targets, microarrays for multiplexing profiling up to whole transcriptome level, and next generation RNA sequencing, i.e., RNA-seq, for analysis of all RNA molecules within a cancer cell (alternative splicing variants, mRNAs, noncoding RNAs and microRNAs).\nmRNA profiling panels have been established for breast cancer and other cancers as well. A set of 97-mRNA profile has achieved satisfactory molecular grading of breast cancer and has been commercialized as the MapQuant Dx Genomic Grade assay.\nProtein markers\nThe technique used for identifying protein markers in immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC staining of the intended protein markers are performed on tumor tissues and stained tissue would demonstrate the presence and distribution of the intended protein markers. The advantage of this technology is that it could provide morphological information about protein expression levels and the procedures are standardized and of low cost. However, assessment of IHC-stained tissue is less quantitative and are subject to bias. Besides, the number of validated protein markers for a certain type of cancer is limited.\nMetabolic markers\nMetabolites are potentially useful for predicting treatment response since they are the endpoint of many molecular pathways. For example, Sreekumar et al reported that the level of sarcosine, which is a derivative of glycine, in the urine of men is correlated with metastasis of prostate cancer.", "prompt": "Prognostic markers are biomarkers used to measure the progress of a disease in the patient sample.

{"full_text": "The Paus family (pronounced [\u02c8p\u00e6\u0289s]) is a Norwegian family that first appeared as members of the elite of 16th-century Oslo and that for centuries belonged to Norway's \"aristocracy of officials\" as priests of the state church, judges and other higher government officials, especially in Upper Telemark. Family members later became involved in shipping, steel and banking. The family is particularly known for its close association with Henrik Ibsen.\nTwo brothers from Oslo who both became priests, Hans (1587\u20131648) and Peder Povelsson Paus (1590\u20131653), have long been known as the family's earliest certain ancestors. In his book Slekten Paus, S.H. Finne-Gr\u00f8nn traced the family two further generations back, to Hans Olufsson (died 1570), a high-ranking member of the royal clergy who held the rank of a knight, the highest rank of nobility in Norway at the time. The name Paus, believed to be of Middle Saxon or Middle Dutch origin, is known in Oslo since the 14th century, notably as the name of the Lawspeaker of Oslo Nikolas Paus (mentioned 1329\u20131347) and as the name of one of medieval Oslo's \"city farms\", Pausinn (mentioned 1324\u20131482). The extant family is descended from Peder Povelsson Paus, who was provost of Upper Telemark from 1633. From the 17th to the 19th century, the family were among the foremost of the regional elite, the \"aristocracy of officials\" in Upper Telemark, where many family members served as priests, judges and other government officials and where several state and church offices in practice were hereditary in the family for extended periods. For example, the office of chief district judge of Upper Telemark was continuously held by the family for 106 years (1668\u20131774) and passed on in an hereditary manner.\nFrom the late 18th century family members successively established themselves as ship's captains, shipowners, wealthy merchants and bankers in the port towns of Skien and Drammen. From the 19th century several family members were prominent as steel industrialists in Christiania; other family members founded the industrial company Paus & Paus in Drammen and Oslo. Family members have also owned or co-owned several other major companies, including Norway's largest shipping company Wilh. Wilhelmsen. Since the early 20th century family members have owned half a dozen estates and castles in Sweden, of which the estates Herresta and N\u00e4sbyholm in S\u00f6dermanland are still owned by the family; the Herresta/N\u00e4sbyholm branch is descended from Tatiana Tolstoy-Paus, Leo Tolstoy's last surviving grandchild. Christopher Tostrup Paus, a papal chamberlain and heir to one of Norway's largest timber companies who donated the Paus collection of classical sculpture to the National Gallery, was conferred the title of count by Pope Pius XI in 1923. A village in India, Pauspur, was named in honour of the family in the 19th century. Family members living in Italy and Austria-Hungary from the 19th century spelled the name de Paus or von Paus.\nThe family's best known descendant is the playwright Henrik Ibsen. Both of his parents belonged to the family in either a biological or social sense. Through the Paus family, their closest relatives, Ibsen's parents had been raised as \"near-siblings.\" Ibsen named or modelled various characters after family members. Episodes and motifs in several of Ibsen's dramas\u2014notably Peer Gynt, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People, The Wild Duck, Rosmersholm, and Hedda Gabler\u2014were inspired by Paus family traditions and real events that took place in the closely intertwined households of the siblings Ole Paus and Hedevig Paus in the early 19th century. The Paus family figures in Ibsen studies, and Jon Nygaard has argued that the emergence of \"the new Puritan state of the officials\" with the spirit of \"Upper Telemark, the Paus family\" is a major theme in Ibsen's work. Modern family members include the troubadour Ole Paus and his son, the composer Marcus Paus. Family members live in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the U.K. and Switzerland. In the course of its history, family members have used multiple seals and coats of arms, including a crane in its vigilance in the seal of Povel Paus on the 1661 Sovereignty Act and a bull's head with golden star used since the 19th century.", "prompt": "The Paus family (pronounced [\u02c8p\u00e6\u0289s]) is a Norwegian family that first appeared as members of the elite of 16th-century Oslo and that for centuries belonged to Norway's \"aristocracy of officials\" as priests of the state church, judges and other higher government officials, especially in Upper Telemark.

{"full_text": "Green Wheat Field with Cypress (French: Champ de bl\u00e9 vert avec cypr\u00e8s) is an oil-on-canvas painting by Dutch Post-Impressionist Vincent van Gogh. It is held by the National Gallery Prague, displayed at the Veletr\u017en\u00ed pal\u00e1c (Fair Trade Palace) in the district of Hole\u0161ovice, where the painting is known as Zelen\u00e9 obil\u00ed (\"Green wheat\").\nLike many similar works at this time, the landscape painting was made on a size 30 canvas and measures 73 cm \u00d7 93.5 cm (28.7 in \u00d7 36.8 in).  It depicts a field of largely green wheat with parts ripening to yellow.  A tall dark fastigiate cypress tree is at the centre of the scene, next to a small white house, with mountains in the background, and a blue sky with white clouds above. The painting was completed in 1889, while van Gogh was voluntarily incarcerated at the asylum of St. Paul near Saint-R\u00e9my in Provence.\n\nOn 16 June 1889, Vincent wrote to his sister Wil that he had just completed the painting, just a few days after he was allowed out to paint en plein air: Then yet another [landscape] that depicts a field of yellowing wheat surrounded by brambles and green bushes. At the end of the field a little pink house with a tall and dark cypress tree that stands out against the distant purplish and bluish hills, and against a forget-me-not blue sky streaked with pink whose pure tones contrast with the already heavy, scorched ears, whose tones are as warm as the crust of a loaf of bread.\"\nHe sent an ink drawing of the painting (F1548, JH1726) with a letter to his brother Theo in early July 1889.  The drawing is now in the Morgan Library & Museum in New York City.  Van Gogh probably sent the painting to Theo with a consignment in September 1889.\nVan Gogh made several other paintings of wheat fields with cypresses when he was able to leave the asylum grounds and explore the local landscape, with the wheat rapidly turning to a ripe yellow. Besides a fondness for cypresses, van Gogh had a special affinity with wheat fields; he depicted them dozens of times over the years; to Vincent they symbolized the cycle of life and death, and he found in them both solace and inspiration.\nAlthough the composition is similar to several paintings by other artists such as Monet, Renoir, Sisley, and Pissarro, the art historian Ronald Pickvance says that \"compared to high Impressionist practice, color is used more locally and the brushstrokes are more organic and vigorously hatched.\" However, \"with no spatial distortions, no excessively heightened color tonalities, and no revolutionary symbolism, this landscape affirms its normality within an Impressionist convention.

{"full_text": "The broad front versus narrow front controversy in World War II arose after General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to advance into Germany on a broad front in 1944, against the suggestions of his principal subordinates, Lieutenant Generals Omar Bradley and George S. Patton and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who argued instead to stage competing advances on narrow fronts. The decision was controversial initially because the British government wanted to raise the profile of the minority British contingent in what was by then an overwhelmingly American army, and they perceived that a British-led thrust to Berlin would achieve this aim. Montgomery's strident advocacy raised political and nationalistic complications that strained the wartime alliance. During the subsequent Cold War, suggestions were made that the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe may have been reduced had Eisenhower sent a narrow-front thrust to race the USSR to Berlin in 1945.\nEisenhower's decision was based on both political and military factors. There were serious reservations in the autumn of 1944 about whether the Allied logistical system could support the narrow-front strategy, because at that time there were insufficient working ports to support large formations far from the coast, the road and rail transport network was already under severe strain, and there were concerns about being able to protect the narrow supply lines deep into enemy territory, through terrain that included crossing many rivers, in weather which hampered air support. In addition the Allied occupation zones in Germany had been agreed upon in February 1944, and a faster Allied advance in the autumn of 1944 would not have altered this. The Soviet Union would have also benefited from a rapid German collapse, and its participation in the war against Japan was greatly desired. The staff at Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) considered Montgomery's proposed advance on the Ruhr and Berlin and Bradley's proposed advance on Metz and the Saar, and assessed both to be feasible, but only on the assumptions that the port of Antwerp was brought rapidly into service, that considerable additional air, rail and road transportation became available, and that the other Allied armies were already poised on the German border. These assumptions were not met until very late in the year, by which time circumstances had changed. The consequences if the narrow front advance had failed, would have been severe.\nThe British historian A. J. P. Taylor credited Chester Wilmot's The Struggle For Europe (1952) as the work that \"launched the myths that Eisenhower prevented Montgomery from winning the war in 1944\". Few historians on either side of the Atlantic accept ending the war in 1944 was possible. \"Wilmot's book\", American historian Maurice Matloff wrote, \"must be taken for what it represents\u2014a suggestive, provocative work on the war written from a British point of view in a period of disenchantment.\" Montgomery's Chief of Staff, Major-General Freddie de Guingand, stated in his post-war account that he had opposed Montgomery's narrow front strategy on political and administrative grounds, but Montgomery's wartime Chief Administrative Officer, Major-General Miles Graham defended his contention that the narrow front advance was logistically feasible.", "prompt": "The broad front versus narrow front controversy in World War II arose after General Dwight D.

The name also applies to at least three other forts built at almost the same location, one during the Texas Revolution, and two during the Civil War.\nIn response to fear of annexation of Texas by the United States during the era of Mexican Texas, the Mexican Congress passed the Law of April 6, 1830, which halted legal immigration by Americans and established military occupation.  Initially, sporadic efforts were made to establish a customs post at this location in 1830 and then again in 1831, but these efforts were less than successful.  As a result, \"Fortaleza de Velasco\" was erected in April to May 1832 by the order of General Ter\u00e1n to enforce the customs and immigration provisions of the new law for the customs port of entry.\nThe original Fort Velasco has been briefly described in several first-hand or contemporaneous accounts.  William J. Russell wrote \u201c\u2026 The plan and structure of the fort were well understood, of circular form, of logs and sand, with strong stakes, sharpened, and placed close together, all around the embankment.  In the center, stood a bastion, in height considerably above the outer wall, on top of which was mounted a long nine-pounder, worked on a pivot, and around which, on top of the bastion, was a parapet made of wood, about two feet in height.\u201d  Edwin Waller described it as \"\u2026 fort of circular form, having in the center a mound or raised platform of earth, whereon the artillery was placed en barbette, so as to fire over the outer wall, and command a range on every side.  This outer wall was surrounded by a fosse or ditch, and perhaps something intended for chevaux de frize or abattis.\"  John H. Brown (whose father was in the Battle of Velasco) wrote \u201c\u2026 The fort at Velasco stood about a hundred and fifty yards both from the river and the Gulf shore which formed a right angle.  It consisted of parallel rows of posts six feet apart, filled between with sand, earth and shells, for the outer walls,  Inside of the walls was an embankment on which musketeers could stand and shoot over without exposing anything but their heads.  In the center was an elevation of the same material, inclosed by higher posts, on which the artillery was planted and protected by bulwarks.\"Soon after its construction, the fort was the site of a skirmish called the Battle of Velasco in the period of June 25\u201329, 1832, as one episode of the Anahuac Disturbances, which was an early indication of unrest leading up to the Texas Revolution.  After an overnight battle, the Mexican forces inside the fort surrendered (primarily due to lack of ammunition) to the Texian forces besieging the fort, and an armistice was signed on June 29, 1832, with the Mexican forces being allowed to return to Matamoros.  Although the armistice agreement called for them to be transported by sea to Matamoros, the lack of a seaworthy vessel resulted in the troops marching overland via San Felipe de Austin and La Bahia back to Matamoros. After the battle, the fort was abandoned, and was probably scavenged for materials as the new town of Velasco grew up around its location.\nIn the period of late 1835 and early 1836, as the Texas Revolution began, a new fort was constructed nearby mounting several large cannon, known as the best protected location on the coast. The Treaties of Velasco which recognized Texas Independence from Mexico were signed at this location on May 14, 1836. This fort was occupied for an extended period, at least through 1840. After the Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the independence of Texas on April 21, 1836, the \"interim\" government chose to establish itself at Velasco, due to available accommodations (as many other towns had been destroyed in the Runaway Scrape or during the Revolution), and the protection offered by this fort and the newly built and robust Republic Of Texas Navy, in the period of May to Oct-1836. The government's records were kept at Velasco for a short period, and the fort was occupied with a small garrison. Financial warrants, notes and pay certificates were issued by the government from Velasco. Elections were held in Sep-1836, after which the government moved to a new capital at Columbia, as the first \"democratically-elected\" government. This second Fort Velasco was eventually abandoned after 1840 and was longer in existence by 1852.\nDuring the early part of Civil War, an early fort (also named as Fort Velasco) was built near the location of the Republic Of Texas fort, mounting two 18-pound cannon, but was augmented in the winter of 1863-1863 by a larger stacked-earth emplacement with five gun platforms known as Fort Sulakowski or Fort Velasco, at a point nearer the existing town.

Traditionally, these anamorphic (asexual or imperfect fungi) mold genera are: Microsporum, Epidermophyton and Trichophyton. There are about 40 species in these three genera. Species capable of reproducing sexually belong in the teleomorphic genus Arthroderma, of the Ascomycota (see Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph for more information on this type of fungal life cycle). As of 2019 a total of nine genera are identified and new phylogenetic taxonomy has been proposed.\nDermatophytes cause infections of the skin, hair, and nails, obtaining nutrients from keratinized material. The organisms colonize the keratin tissues causing inflammation as the host responds to metabolic byproducts. Colonies of dermatophytes are usually restricted to the nonliving cornified layer of the epidermis because of their inability to penetrate the viable tissue of an immunocompetent host. Invasion does elicit a host response ranging from mild to severe. Acid proteinases (proteases), elastase, keratinases, and other proteinases reportedly act as virulence factors. Additionally, the products of these degradative enzymes serve as nutrients for the fungi. The development of cell-mediated immunity correlated with delayed hypersensitivity and an inflammatory response is associated with clinical cure, whereas the lack of or defective cell-mediated immunity predisposes the host to chronic or recurrent dermatophyte infection.\nSome of these skin infections are known as ringworm or tinea (which is the Latin word for \"worm\"), though infections are not caused by worms. It is thought that the word tinea (worm) is used to describe the snake-like appearance of the dermatophyte on the skin. Toenail and fingernail infections are referred to as onychomycosis.

One of the assaulting divisions of the Cavalry Army, the Soviet 11th Cavalry Division, managed to break the front line between the two Polish armies and assaulted a fortified village of Bystrzyk, defended only by a single infantry company of the Polish 50th Kresy Rifles Regiment. After a short skirmish, the Poles were defeated. As the Cossack cavalry took no prisoners, all 75 Poles were killed, including prisoners and wounded in action. The exact Russian losses are unknown. Shortly after the skirmish, the commander of the Polish 13th Infantry Division, Gen. Franciszek Paulik, dispatched the reserve Polish 40th Infantry Regiment, but it was too late to relieve the defenders of Bystryk and the regiment lacked enough firepower to defeat an entire division. Because of that, the Polish tactical counter-offensive was repelled. The following day, the Russian division expanded the gap, broke through to the other side of the front and managed to drive approximately 15 kilometres towards the rear of the Polish forces.\nThis created a gap in the Polish front and endangered the rear of the Polish 13th division. The commander of the Polish 6th Army, Gen. Wac\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz, ordered a counter-assault group to be created out of all available reserves. The group, commanded by Jerzy Sawicki, was composed of two regiments of his 3rd Cavalry Brigade, as well as two infantry battalions from the 19th Infantry Regiment and two batteries of field artillery. The Polish counter-assault started at 1 o'clock in the night of 1 June 1920. The Poles caught the 11th Cavalry Division by surprise in the village of Staro\u015bci\u0144ce. Although the forces of both sides were more or less equal, the surprise was decisive and the Russians sounded a retreat after a short skirmish.

The genesis of this conflict rests in two agreements in 1892 and 1924 between the Madras Presidency and Kingdom of Mysore. The 802 kilometres (498 mi) Kaveri river has 44,000 km2 basin area in Tamil Nadu and 32,000 km2 basin area in Karnataka.  The annual inflow from Karnataka is 425 TMCft (12 km3) whereas that from Tamil Nadu is 252 TMCft  (7.1 km3).\nBased on the inflow Karnataka is demanding its due share of water from the river.

Beginning in 1868, the new Meiji government approved a series of laws that separated Japanese native kami worship, on one side, from Buddhism which had assimilated it, on the other.\nWhen Buddhism was introduced from China in the Asuka period (6th century), the Japanese tried to reconcile the new beliefs with the older Shinto beliefs, assuming both were true. As a consequence, Buddhist temples (\u5bfa, tera) were attached to local Shinto shrines (\u795e\u793e, jinja) and vice versa and devoted to both kami and Buddhist figures. The local religion and foreign Buddhism never fused into a single, unified religion, but remained inextricably linked to the present day through interaction. The depth of the influence from Buddhism on local religious beliefs can be seen in much of Shinto's conceptual vocabulary and even the types of Shinto shrines seen today. The large worship halls and religious images are themselves of Buddhist origin. The formal separation of Buddhism from Shinto took place only as recently as the end of the 19th century; however, in many ways, the blending of the two still continues.\nThe term shinbutsu sh\u016bg\u014d itself was coined during the early modern era (17th century) to refer to the amalgamation of kami and buddhas in general, as opposed to specific currents within Buddhism which did the same, e.g. Ry\u014dbu Shint\u014d and Sann\u014d Shint\u014d.

Established in 1905, it is the world's oldest automobile race. The 18-carat gold trophy is based on Giambologna's sculpture of the Greek god Hermes. Series to have featured the trophy include the World Sportscar Championship, the FIA GT Cup, the World Touring Car Championship, the European Touring Car Championship, the FIA GT Championship, the British Touring Car Championship, the FIA GT1 World Championship, and the overall winners of the British GT Championship in the 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004 seasons. It has been presented to the overall winners of the Silverstone Circuit round of the FIA World Endurance Championship from 2013 on.\nThe race was first contested on the Isle of Man in 1905 and continued to be held on the island until 1922. It moved to the Ards Circuit on Northern Ireland's public roads in 1928 after an article written by the journalist Wallace McLeod in a Belfast newspaper suggested it occur in the area and the inventor Harry Ferguson helped the RAC to find a suitable track. Donington Park staged the trophy's following two races in 1937 and 1938 after a major accident involving a Riley car during the 1936 edition killed eight onlookers and injured another 25. Following the Second World War, it returned to Northern Ireland and was held on the shorter Dundrod Circuit; a second major crash that killed three competitors in 1955 led the local authorities to bar all future car races on the track. Since then, the race has occurred on permanent racing circuits rather than closed public road tracks.\nJohn Napier in an Arrol-Johnston was the event's inaugural winner in 1905. The first non-British driver to win the race was the Frenchman Jean Chassagne, who drove a Sunbeam Tourist Trophy car to victory in the 1922 race. Italian driver Tazio Nuvolari became the first driver in history to claim the trophy in 1933 to accompany it with an overall victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the same year.
