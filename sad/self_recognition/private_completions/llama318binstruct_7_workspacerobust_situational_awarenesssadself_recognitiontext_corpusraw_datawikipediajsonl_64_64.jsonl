{"full_text": "Abe Tadaaki (\u963f\u90e8 \u5fe0\u79cb, September 4, 1602 \u2013 June 25, 1671) was a high-ranking government official in Japan under Tokugawa Iemitsu and Ietsuna, the third and fourth Tokugawa Sh\u014dgun. As the daimy\u014d of the Oshi Domain in modern-day Saitama Prefecture, with an income of 80,000 koku (earlier 50,000), Abe was appointed wakadoshiyori (junior councillor) in 1633, and r\u014dj\u016b (Elder Councillor) shortly afterwards.\nIemitsu died in 1651 and was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Ietsuna. In accordance with the custom of junshi, a number of Iemitsu's closest retainers and advisors committed suicide so as to follow their lord in death; Abe did not engage in this practice, and was left, along with a handful of other high-ranking officials and advisors, to handle the affairs of government.\nEspecially remembered for his integrity, high morals, and practical sense of good government, Abe Tadaaki is known for his attempts to find employment for a number of samurai who became r\u014dnin in the wake of the Keian Uprising, a coup d'\u00e9tat which failed to be executed that same year, just after Iemitsu's death. While other government ministers reacted to the uprising with the instinctive desire to expel all r\u014dnin from Edo (the shogunal capital; today Tokyo), Abe thought it more pertinent to take a somewhat softer tack, aiding the r\u014dnin in seeking legitimate employment, and thus drastically reducing the number who would have reason to take up arms against the shogunate.\nSeveral years before Tadaaki's death in 1671, Sakai Tadakiyo was appointed head of the council of r\u014dj\u016b; Tadaaki constantly rebuked Sakai for his poor sense of proper policy, and his laidback nature. He accused Sakai of taking bribes, and of handling situations on a case-by-case basis, without any sense of overall policy or progress towards a goal. Nevertheless, after thirty-eight years of loyal service to the shogunate, Tadaaki died aged 69, leaving the government in the hands of the likes of those whose policies (or dire lack thereof) would lead over the course of several decades to the Genroku period (1688\u20131704), which saw a peak in corruption, hedonism, and wastefulness.", "prompt": "Abe Tadaaki (\u963f\u90e8 \u5fe0\u79cb, September 4, 1602 \u2013 June 25, 1671) was a high-ranking government official in Japan under Tokugawa Iemitsu and Ietsuna, the third and fourth Tokugawa Sh\u014dgun.

He was also a noted sportsman, representing Ireland at both cricket and field hockey.\nBorn at Donnycarney, Porter was the son of Andrew Marshall Porter senior (later 1st Baronet), a lawyer who was an MP for Londonderry and served variously as Ireland's Solicitor-General, Attorney-General, and Master of the Rolls, and his wife Agnes Horsburgh. The elder Porter sent his son to Harrow School, where he kept wicket for the school's cricket team and was praised by James Lillywhite, a former England captain, as a \"very hard hitter\". In 1892, he played in the annual match between Eton and Harrow at Lord's, which Harrow won. Despite being offered a scholarship to Oxford, Porter opted to return home to study law at Trinity College Dublin. He continued his cricket career for the Dublin University Cricket Club, and during the 1895 season, played in four matches with first-class status \u2013 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Dublin, against Leicestershire and Cambridge University on a brief tour of England, and then a return fixture against Cambridge University in Dublin.
