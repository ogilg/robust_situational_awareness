If you die on 8-4 it will start you on 8-1. Still cool though.\nTheKunit: Seems like Nintendo intentionally made the switch version include something like this. I can't imagine it was accidental. When you load your profile it only takes you to the last caslte you beat. Meaning if you beat 5 levels and got to all castle but can't beat it, you go back to the previous castle when you load the game. It's meant a lot of redoing levels and it went from the wii version being my families favorite game to the switch version not being used at all.\nfatphotog: The switch nes app has save states, you can literally save at any moment no matter where you are. You start exactly at that moment when you go back. Are you not using the save state function?\nTheKunit: It's not super Mario Brothers nes it's super Mario Brothers deluxe for the switch.\n\nAlso how do I get the nes version? I have only had my switch for a short time. Didn't even know you could get old games like that.\nfatphotog: Oh you mean new super Mario bro\u2019s delux, my bad. You can still quick save where you are on the map in that game. I forget the exact process but I think you just pause and choose quick save. It will make you quit back to the menu but will have a little balloon next to your save file meaning it\u2019s been quick saved and you\u2019ll start right from the point of the map where you quick saved. The original nes version is part of the online subscription that you can pay for. It allows you to have online access in supported games and also comes with a nes channel and a SNES channel. They each have many games from each console you can play anytime as long as you are subbed to Nintendo online. I think it\u2019s like $3 dollars a month or something.\nTheKunit: Unfortunately the quick save function either only works once or has some other odd requirement that it does not tell you about. At this point I've done the beginning of the game up to the second works at least 3 or 4 times and so far it's still forcing me to restart from the world 1 castle. I quick wave every time. Doing some research you are supposed to go back and beat an easy castle so it fully saves the game. I don't know why a basic save function is so difficult for Nintendo to figure out but it's infuriating. Super Mario party is the same way. You can't save in the game at all. If you quit during a game it's gone for good.\nfatphotog: When you\u2019re done playing, if you have gone a couple levels since the last castle or mushroom house, just quick save..Next time you want to play you start where you quick saved.\nTheKunit: OK but I've done that. If you have to play multiple sessions between castles it won't save more than the one time.\nfatphotog: I don\u2019t understand, just quick save again?\n\n*edit  Do you mean once you restart from a quick save you lose all your lives before beating a castle or finding a mushroom house? Yes if you lose all your lives after starting from a quick save, you will start at your last *real* save point. It\u2019s very, very difficult in this game to actually lose all your lives imo.\nTheKunit: https://www.gamepur.com/guides/nsmbu-deluxe-how-to-save\n\nThis is a good descriptor of the issue\nfatphotog: Right, and that article clearly states that if you don\u2019t quick save again, which is all you\u2019ll have to do, you go back to your last \u201creal\u201d save. Which is exactly what I said.\nTheKunit: Basically if you turn off the switch or put in another game the quick save function doesn't work\nfatphotog: Yes, so don\u2019t do that? The article is literally saying exactly what I\u2019m saying. This is how the very short article ends: \u201cOnce you reload the save file where the Quick Save occurred, you\u2019ll need to keep quick saving to keep your progress indefinitely before you reach an actual save point.\n\nIf you turn the system off or close the game without Quick Sav, you\u2019ll be sent back to the previous actual save you did\u2014which means you could lose tons of progress that you made through difficult levels.\u201d\nTheKunit: Dude I'm telling you it's not without quick saving like you are trying to make out. You seem hell bent on proving that an internet stranger doesn't understand how to save a freaking video game though so idk what to tell you. It's not like I've been playing video games for my entire life and know how to do basic shit like saving, pressing the menu button, or jumping.\n\nI also need help getting my undies on after my nurse assisted shower.\n\nGood riddance\nfatphotog: Holy shit bro, I\u2019m not being rude at all. I\u2019m just answering your questions. The article you posted says literally the exact same thing that I am saying. Just don\u2019t turn the game off or put in another game without quick saving first. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know what else to say. I mean it\u2019s not hard at all to understand, so now I am going to be condescending, because you are clearly stupid.

They only gave money to people who were already unemployed. They basically just had a slightly different unemployment/welfare program and didnt study any of the effects of what would happen if you gave money to people who were already doing reasonably well in their finances.\ndid_you_read_it: UBI seems great, when wearing my idealist hat it feels like more than just an amicable goal but one that could signal a next great leap in civilization.  where the Agricultural revolution freed up humanity to pursue more diverse work a UBI could free up humanity to pursue self actualization.  why should society be such that i must spend the bulk of my life working. \n\n\nOTOH I have no idea how it would even work or *if* it could work.  Economy is a funny thing and this could just result in a flat inflation, or even create dystopian lifestyle where the majority subsist in poor government housing, cared for but not really living.  Not to mention that right now we do still need  people to work. As the saying goes \"the world needs ditch diggers too\"\n\n\nI think we won't really see this hit until we move into a post-labor scarcity world.  We have already shifted economics in a time where many products only have artificial scarcity.  Music, movies, programs can all be copied indefinitely, even many physical products have little physical value.   With robotics and AI it seems that eventually we will reach the singularity, where base human labor is obsolete in all but the most niche areas.\nkuhzoo: &gt; UBI seems great, when wearing my idealist hat ...\n\nTo be fair though, that seems like the case for Communism, Capitalism, Democracy, Monarchy, Anarchism, etc.  Just sit back and listen to the tone of an amateur philosopher who's just read a book about one of the above and fallen in love with the idea of it.\n\nPersonally, I'm of the opinion that every system I listed above in it's pure form will fail for various reasons.  Capitalism devolves into monopolies. Communism gets co-opted by greed.  Democracies ham-string great individual leaders. Monarchies are brought down by one bad, or sometimes even mediocre, leader.  Anarchism doesn't really scale with population growth. ... And the flaws keep going.  At that point the solution to the draw-backs of one is to balance it with the benefits and draw-backs of another.  The US has historically been strongly capitalist, but there have often been mitigating communist/socialist policies, like The New Deal, eras with strong unions, etc. too.  \nAt which point we get back to UBI, and I see it as a dose of socialism to try to keep the draw-backs of capitalism in check.  (AFAICT, right now the US is running full steam toward the pure capitalism ending ... which would explain the rise in more socialist ideas.  People are trying to curve us back toward equilibrium.)\n\nOur idealized systems fail when they come into contact with reality where different people have different problems and priorities. Different enough problems and priorities that no one system will adequately support all of them.  Even using multiple systems to balance each other will still cause chafing and strife, but can prevent us from ever catastrophically failing the way, I believe, pure systems inevitably do.  Even the solution of 'balance' fails because someone always wants to unbalance it to get rid of their own pain points (or because they fell in love with an ideal).  \nThere is no one solution.  Like life, it's an ever shifting balance that collapses and fails if it goes too far toward any extreme or it can't adapt to it's changing environment.\ndid_you_read_it: There could be a future solution. Problem really is that all society is a pyramid (at best maybe a box). Under any scheme, doesn't matter if you're communist capitalist or socialist. \n\n\"The world needs ditch diggers too\"  The only difference is who ends up as one and why.\n\n*however* I think eventually we will reach the robotic singularity and we could build a human society where almost nobody is the base of the pyramid.  Propped up on a tireless army of robotic slave labor we could potentially achieve some aspect of these ideal governments. sure there will always be people at the \"bottom\" but when the bottom is 6 layers of robots up from the ground that could be some pretty cushy living.\nkuhzoo: Based on [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/extreme-poverty-america-un-special-monitor-report)^1 I don't think your robotic singularity will happen and if it does, it still won't make the changes you think it will.  There will be people either left behind without robots to support them, or there will still be tasks we can't fully automate that'll require humans down at the very bottom with the robots.  The US is the richest nation in the world by many estimates, and we have citizens living in conditions we would consider 'poor' in a 3rd world nation.\n\nYour ideal of a post-robotic singularity fails for the same reason all the other ideals fail, reality is too messy and inconsistent for everyone to fit into it... and many of those people who don't fit will be necessary to keep it going.\n\n1: warning link does not qualify as 'uplifting'\n", "prompt": "ratskim: Universal basic income seems to improve employment and well-being - The world\u2019s most robust study of universal basic income has concluded that it boosts recipients\u2019 mental and financial well-being, as well as modestly improving employment.\n\nw1n5t0nM1k3y: This study keeps getting cited", "orig": ", but seems to have a major flaw in regards to testing the UBI.

I have a couple of questions before cutting into the plumbing. I created a diagram and included a picture below. You can access the diagram here and make edits if you'd like to help me confirm plumbing layout. [https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/3335eea1-83f3-405f-be58-b6f7563cd66b](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/3335eea1-83f3-405f-be58-b6f7563cd66b)\n\nMy questions are-\n\n1. There are a couple of branches off the main water line to our bathroom and kitchen before it reaches the water heater/utility room. I've read you want to install the softener right next to the main entry point for the water. This is not possible in my house so what is the next best thing?  \n2. I would want to leave our drinking water and outside spigots off the softener, so those would have to be looped out?\n3. Is it ok to just install the softener before the heater and not soften the cold water going to our bathroom/kitchen? or would it be stupid to do that and should I just soften the whole house?\n4. What is the ideal way to plumb to this softener based on the diagram below? Maybe I am just overcomplicating this.\n\nI feel good about doing the actual work, I would really like to confirm i am doing it the right way before i go through with it though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r8cp95lmxq41.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c553b8a676c855b82224eefb2905259b0a87ef1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idqc02ajmxq41.jpg?width=1724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec264596d6cd6c8feb6e6bdb6c9fac134d18805e\nTobyChan: I\u2019m in the UK so take what I say with a pinch of salt (did you see what I did there?)\n\nOver here it\u2019s normal to soften the water for the whole house expect you must leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap.  I would also leave any outdoor taps unsoftened so that you can water plants with untreated water.\nGrimResistance: &gt; leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap\n\nWhy is this?\nTobyChan: So you\u2019re not drinking and cooking with salty water\njohnwayne2413: Soft water is perfectly okay to drink.  I ran the numbers.\n\nTypically, water softeners add 46 mg/ liter of sodium for every 100 mg/liter of hardness minerals present in the water.\n\nThe grain per gallon (gpg) is a unit of water hardness defined as 1 grain (64.8 milligrams) of calcium carbonate dissolved in 1 US gallon of water (3.785412 L)\n\nThat works out to 17.11834802 mg calcium carbonate per liter of water.\n\nMy water is 18 grains hardness (which is very hard) so:\n\n    18 * 17.11834802 mg = 308.1302644 mg\n\nThe softener will add 141.7399216 mg sodium to 1 Liter of water (\\~34 ounces).\n\n    46 mg/L Na / 100 mg/L CaCO\u2083 = x / 308.1302644 mg CaCO\u2083\n    100x = 14,173.99 mg/L Na\n    x = 141.7399216 mg/L Na\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day\u2014that's equal to about 1 teaspoon of table salt!\n\nThis is how much water you would have to drink per day to exceed your salt intake:\n\n    (2,300 mg / 141.7399216 mg) * 34 ounces = 551 ounces of water per day\n\nIf you drank that much water in a day, ironically, you would die from hyponatremia (dilution of sodium in your blood) before you died from hypertension.\n\nTest your water hardness with a proper kit, the dropper kind, not the strips.  If your water is less hard than 18 grains then your safety margin is even higher.\n\nMost people should worry about eating potato chips or french fries adding too much salt to their body than drinking softened water.\nTobyChan: Again\u2026 read my caveat, I\u2019m from the UK and we have a limit on the sodium content on potable water supply.  Also, you have to appreciate that hardness is a relative term.  I\u2019ve seen borehole supplies that have been softened to the limit which still remain very hard.  If an untreated supply to the kitchen was added they could have softened the water further and actually got some benefit from the treatment!\n", "prompt": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello!

{"full_text": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for. Rather, I have once heard of a study citing that skipping breakfast can trigger an insulin response which would immediately store any and all calories ingested throughout the day into fat. \n\n\nDoes this have any credibility behind it? Does skipping breakfast help your weight loss personally? \nscreepatrol: Any studies that have weird findings about skipping meals or eating 8 meals a day or whatever are either 1) paid for their results by the industry or 2) terribly controlled. \n\nEat once a day. Eat 8 times a day. Eat only during a certain period or snack all day. Your body is great at partitioning calories and the effects of when you eat that food are somewhere between negligible and nonexistent. \n\nToo often people look at what professional bodybuilders/weightlifters/strongmen do and think that's how you succeed. Those guys are at the top level and the only thing left is to focus on the last 1%. The other 99% is controlling your calories/macros and progressive overload in training. \n\nDon't overthink this. \nSpicyThingy: Its not about the calories. Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000% which leads to better fat burning and better muscle growth. That doesnt have to do with sponsorships, it is just measureing. \nNihilii: &gt; increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over\n\nSo is it up to, or is it over? Or does \"up to over 1000%\" mean anywhere between 0 and infinity? I mean that would surely be correct, but not very useful.\n\nAnd do you have any source for those revelations?\nSpicyThingy: Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass. \nNihilii: &gt;Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass.\n\nWell, it's not my first language either, and \"up to and over\" is a classic marketing spiel (that crops up not just in english), which is why I'm giving you attitude for doing it. \n\nBut to the point - your own source, a single study mind you, so not a very strong ground to declare something as a hard fact, has found a 1000% increase in mean GH level after **5 days of fasting**. They were also **injecting the subjects with Growth-Hormone Releasing Hormone**. Based on that you say this:\n\n&gt;Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\nSo even forgetting that slip of the tongue there, you are still clearly suggesting that just intermittent fasting can give you a tenfold GH increase. This is naive at best, and purposefully misleading at worst. How can you consider that study in any way comparable to a person doing something like a typical 16/8 intermittent fasting schedule? \n\nSeriously. You either haven't read the paper you linked or you're sensationalizing this on purpose. I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nYou don't get to pull the asshole card when you're lying to people.\nthoughtihadanacct: While the 1000% claim by u/SpicyThingy may be an exaggeration (deliberate or not I can\u2019t say), it is also unfair of you to entirely discredit the study he cited based on the reasons you have given.\n\nIn figures 2 and 3 and table 1 of the study, it clearly shows that GH concentration increases from fasting even on day 1. Yes the effect on day 1 may be lower than on day 5, and again the 1000% claim may have been misleading. However you seem to be implying that the benefits of fasting with regard to HGH only happen after 5 days, and you claim that the study in no way has bearing on 16:8 fasting. The fact that there is some (albeit lower) effect on day 1 of fasting suggests that 16/8 fasting may have some benefits (albeit lower than say 5 day fasting).\n\nYou boldly state that the reserchers injected the subjects with GHRH, in an attempt to discredit the study. This was dishonest. While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed. And from fig 2 the effects of the injection do not last more than about 3 hours. The injections were done to investigate the effect of fasting on GHRH sensitivity. (True the study could have been \u201cbetter\u201d by focusing on only one thing at a time, but it stands that the injections don\u2019t negate the findings regarding GH release.)\n\nIn the end what Im saying is that it\u2019s not binary - ie it\u2019s not \u201cfasting results in 1000% increase in GH\u201d vs \u201cbullshit the study is meaningless/useless\u201d. What I\u2019m arguing is that fasting does increase GH levels to some extent. More (longer) fasting results in more increase. The exact magnitude of increase is variable and probably differs from person to person.\nNihilii: I never said the study is meaningless. I said what the guy said was misleading and even the single study he picked to support his position does not do so. You can't just sling around some numbers from a study without looking at the context. This was an extremely sloppy attempt at backing one's claims with science.\n\n&gt;While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed.\n\nWell, that's my bad then. It was not clear to me from the study design that the post-GHRH injection measurements were not included in the later analysis and I can't honestly say I read the thing front-to-back since it was pretty late that night. In-depth analysis of this study was not my point though, as I said.\nthoughtihadanacct: \u201cthe single study he picked to support his position does not do so.\u201d\n\nDepends what (you think) his position is. If his position is literally that fasting for 16 hours a day increases GH levels by 1000% in every human being, then yes the study does not support it. However if we are a bit more generous and assume his position is that fasting \u201csignificantly\u201d increases GH level in general, then I believe the study does support that position to some extent.\n", "prompt": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would", "orig": "usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for.

{"full_text": "BrotisBoughtAHouse: Any Roofing Expertise? Please help.\nGreetings Reddit,\n\nMy girlfriend and I recently bought a home in the Midwest, Missouri to be specific.  It's been great, minus my lack of handy experience, but everyone has to start somewhere. \n\nWe had a lot of rain this week and as a result our ceiling sprung a [leek](http://imgur.com/nCSd0bq).  Today I decided to check it out before calling a professional.  The portion of the [roof](http://imgur.com/0Tc9gUd) that is leaking seems to be some sort of metal that is sealed (or is supposed to be).  It is on a dormer that was likely an addition at some point. The rest of the roof is shingled and looks to be in decent shape. \n\nThe problem appears to be the vents in the roof.  Here is:\n*[Vent 1](http://imgur.com/NaWBtS1)\n*[Vent 2](http://imgur.com/Vt7xqAH)\n\nIt is fairly apparent at this point where the water is coming into the house at. I picked away some of the material around Vent 1 and it looks something like this [underneath](http://imgur.com/RvdOKt0). \n\nIt seems that I need to scrape off as much of the weathered sealant as I can and replace the flashing around the vents.  Then reseal the entire dormer portion of the roof with a better product.  Am I right in this methodology or missing something?\n\nSomebody that has experienced this before: what products work best for sealing this type of roof? What about something like [this](http://flexsealproducts.com/shop/liquid/?gclid=CjwKEAjwpfC5BRCT1sKW2qzwqE0SJABkKFKR8vrBSPm1j268gQ3Ni2tXcIO6EmJD-F04Kx3Dj91bFhoC_vnw_wcB)?\nThe appearance in this location isn't very important, as it can't be seen from the ground.\n\nThanks a bunch!\nsomeonesdaddy: I laugh so hard at everyone in this thread that says call a roofer. I laugh even harder at the top comment that says call the previous homeowner and ask him to help pay for it. \n\nThese roof vents are known frequent culprits for leaking and it is no big deal. Clean the area up and apply a rubberized compound or tar. I have even used the rubberized aerosol spray before thus creating a rubber boot.\n\nI like the rubberized product called stop leak. It comes in a one gallon paint can and you apply/shape it with a putty knife. For a complex shape I will wear rubber gloves and mold it by hand. \n\nYou are a homeowner now and welcome to the big leagues.  You can't call someone everytime your toilet is clogged anymore. Go forth and be the master of your castle.\n\nYour average contractor will scare you into turning a small job into a big one. This is especially true if they think the homeowner is not very mechanically savvy. \nAbsolutelyPink: While I agree that a roofing contractor can scare you into turning a small job into a big one, this roof is in bad shape and flat or semi-flat roofing jobs are best left to a professional.  Spraying rubber isn't going to fix this one. \n\nI have roofing experience, but there are specialty products meant for flat roofs that aren't as simply as spraying rubber on the roof. It need to be redone and not just around the vents.\n\nMake sure you call a couple companies for estimates and make sure they specialize in flat roofs.  You can check with mobile home sellers in your area for referrals as well.\n\nYou will also need to fix that drywall.  Odds are, the insulation (if any) above that is wet as well.  The drywall will need replacing at a minimum.  If it's still wet, poke a couple holes in it to let the water drain.\n\nAs a temporary measure, tarp your roof until you get it repaired.\nsomeonesdaddy: I agree with you and your advice is sound. There have been times in my life when I could not afford the proper solution or the best one.\n\nI have made due with patching stuff like this in the past. In Florida where I live the roofing laws are funny because of hurricanes. If anything more than 25% of the roof is damaged you are required to get a whole new roof. \n\nI have seen plenty of good roofs complete torn off because a small section needed repair. These days homeowners are looking for a roofer  that is not going to pull a permit thus requiring inspection. \nAbsolutelyPink: I agree.  I've been in the position where I couldn't afford to have things done properly and made due with what I could afford.  It sucks.  Unfortunately, a roof is not where you want to pinch pennies. Heck, in Nevada we get winds enough to rip off a roof. This roof will leak and leak again until it's redone.  Let's just hope there hasn't been enough damage already, to cause the ceiling or roof to cave in though mold might already be of issue.\nBrotisBoughtAHouse: Thanks for the feedback.  I think I might be able to handle the flashing parts, but as others have pointed out, there are likely greater underlying problems that I don't want to risk.

{"full_text": "aschulz90: An attempt at DIY mold removal leads to a stinkier house..uh oh?\nI have an old (\\~100 yr old) house with rubble foundation (\\~1600 sq feet, mostly two story) located in new england.\n\nThe first floor had a hardly noticeable mildew-y smell that came from the basement. The basement especially had this smell and I'm still confident for reasons to be shared below that the smell originates from the basement. There is a dehumidifier running 24/7 in the basement and usually registers in the 30%s, pretty good!.\n\nIn this basement was a giant, moldy, plywood, DIY shelf / wall. Personally I think it was pretty thoughtless of the previous owner to put such a good food source for mold down in the basement. I demolished and threw into a rented dumpter the entirety of that plywood/2x4 two days ago (Saturday). Then yesterday (Sunday) in a full tyveck suit and mold mask I sprayed a \\~20% bleach / water solution around where the plywood had been sitting and scrubbed / swept alot of the mess into a garabage bag and threw that into the dumpster as well. I did this with the attached garage door open and a fan running in the basement. After my DIY remediation in the evening I closed the first floor windows and the garage door and let the fan run overnight to help dry out the basement.\n\nWe awoke this morning and now the house has a crazy strong musky smell. Luckily I suspect the bedroom must have been well sealed off as there was quiet a difference walking out into the hallway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow our first floor really stinks though and I'm worried about the following:\n\n1. I've spread mold to everywhere and now the whole sill of the house, joists, flooring, etc will get moldy (though I think that's unlikely...hopefully?).\n2. That there is ***another*** source of mold which I can't find that I disrupted with the fan and blew around the house (even crawled around the crawl space mentioned below looking for other mold with a flashlight) .\n\nAny thoughts or tips would be appreciated. \n\nBasement background:  most of the basement is walking height with poured concrete floor and relatively well pointed walls, not too bad. Never gets too wet down there though can get humid. The kitchen of the house however sits on a rubble foundation with dirt floor but a vapor barrier sits above the dirt floor. The sealing between the stone and plastic is far from perfect. Since I can't see it I'm worried about what's going on below the vapor barrier.\n\nThanks for any help after reading this long post.\nvelcrobungee: I just posted on a similar problem.\n\nI did two things.\n\n1. Spray the basement walls/floors/ceilings with Concrobium\n2. I bought an ozone generator (dangerous to use, be very careful).\n\nThe concrobium is like borax, it goes on wet but when it dries it forms crystals that explode the mold spores. It lasts but can be rubbed off the surface. It also re-forms crystals if the basement gets humid again. (you still have to fix the underlying problem, the damp basement needs to be vented.\n\nI've used that ozone generator for many other things including my cars,, pet odors,, etc\n\nThis is the one I purchased, it's supposed to be a good one. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pbrfeVEI8c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pbrfeVEI8c)\n\nThis is where I learned about Concrobium [https://makeitright.ca/approved-products/concrobium/](https://makeitright.ca/approved-products/concrobium/)\nhasoneconleche: Mold expert here!  \n\nConcrobium is a FANTASTIC product.  But there are multiple products under that name.  The 2-Part mold stain remover you mix is what you want.  It saves all the time of sanding and cleaning nooks and crannies.  \n\nOzone does nothing for mold.  Don\u2019t risk your health or waste your money. \n\nFixing the moisture problem is priority #1.  Then clean up the mold.\nhasoneconleche: Additional advice for the concrobium:  YOU MUST HAVE NEGATIVE AIR PRESSURE AND WEAR A FULL FACE RESPIRATOR WITH A PURPLE/GRAY ( ORGANIC VAPOR). FILTER.  Tyvek suit also highly recommended- it may discolor your  clothing.  \n\nThe offgas is gnarly.  It will burn your eyes and lungs.

To be clear, it's not all Russian Gangstigarchs or cartel bosses doing it on the low, but as barriers to global capital flow have fallen, prospective homeowners and renters are increasingly competing in a market inflated by wealthy foreign speculators who are able to pay cash on the barrelhead and see American real estate as a commodified store of value rather than a place to live. I think it's reductive to blame that entirely or even primarily for the drop in home ownership, I'd personally give that honor to wage stagnation, but as far as I know the idea that it's had an effect isn't a particularly controversial one.\nemilyst: &gt; My understanding was that we were talking about America, where there are far fewer than a billion houses.\n\nI apologize, millions.\n\n&gt; I think it's reductive to blame that entirely or even primarily for the drop in home ownership, I'd personally give that honor to wage stagnation, but as far as I know the idea that it's had an effect isn't a particularly controversial one.\n\nMy contention is the effect is almost entirely due to wage stagnation and similar economic inequality factors, but I don't really have meaningful data to shore up this position presently, so I'll just have to say, I think I agree with you generally but wonder about some specifics.\nsammythemc: &gt;My contention is the effect is almost entirely due to wage stagnation and similar economic inequality factors, but I don't really have meaningful data to shore up this position presently, so I'll just have to say, I think I agree with you generally but wonder about some specifics.\n\nWell it's important to note that in spite of the all-too-frequent \"foreign hordes\" framing, this fundamentally *is* a matter of economic inequality.

{"full_text": "SweelFor: What is your mid/long term plan for BWF training ?\nHi everyone\n\nFor these past few days I have been thinking about how I would like to structure my training in the mid/long term. I know what my short term training structure is and I know when it's gonna end and I was wondering what I wanted to do next.\n\nCurrently I am finishing Level 1 of Calisthenic Movement's program. There are 5 levels and going through 1 to 5 takes about 1 year and a few months I think.\n\nWhen I'll have completed CM's program I don't think I'll get on skills training. It seems a lot of people start calisthenics and quickly want to start training levers, planche, etc. It seems wiser to me to train basic movements strength for a few years before training the levers or planche. Would you agree ? I like to take some perspective and remind myself that I want to train for strength, looks, etc, but also longevity and I think in 20 years when I'll look back, waiting 2 or 3 years before training hard BW skills will seem like nothing and I'll be happy with my decisions.\n\nI think I'd be interested after CM's program by GMB's floor program to learn basic locomotion movements and develop further body awareness.\n\nAfter that, I don't know.\n\n\nWhat are your plans for future training ? \nJPSYCHC: Start \ngrimgrau: I'm wishing you some luck and sending you good vibes so you can follow through and start working out.\n\nMay I ask what you feel has been keeping you from starting?\nJPSYCHC: I'm coming out of a heroin addiction I am only 10 days clean but I finally feel good physically. \ngrimgrau: 10 days clean from heroin is still a difficult thing to accomplish. Every day, even every hour for a long time past 10 days can stretch on for eternity. I've known many people who became addicted to opiates and opioids and it's really tough. Getting through the withdrawals seems to be like absolute hell.\n\nIf you didn't know already there's an awful lot of research out there that shows that cardiovascular exercise can help a ton with recovery, though. Strength training is also a big help, but from what I've read and heard it's the cardio that seems to do the most good.\n\nIf you can even bring yourself to do just a few exercises at first that'll still be great. You don't necessarily have to do the entire routine the first few times through.\n\nHere's hoping you can continue on the path to recovery. :)\nJPSYCHC: Thanks man. I think I can even though I have failed so many times already. I appreciate this \ngrimgrau: The important thing is that you're trying again even though you haven't succeeded before. Like I said it's really tough to get off of heroin and I know full well that you know that. The addiction is so fucking insidious. The way it hijacks your brain is just evil.\n\nIs it possible that you may be able to get into some sort of medication maintenance program? I know that those programs have pretty strict rules, but I've known some people who were able to get off of the heroin by taking suboxone or methadone for a while and then, eventually, taper off.\n\nSome people need to be on it long-term, but in some cases that can be a lot better than having to go out and think about how to score more heroin. Firstly, it eliminates the illegality of possession and some of the stuff people might do in order to score. Secondly, there's a LOT of cut heroin out there these days. There's no telling what might be in the stuff and with the crap that some people are cutting it with one shot, sniff, or smoke could mean instant death. Fentanyl and carfentanyl are outright instant killers compared to heroin on its own.\n\nWhatever path you choose I wish you the best of luck.\nJPSYCHC: I am on suboxone and in an IOP\n\nMy dope had fent in it, I know because I tested positive for it regularly. But believe it or not in my state, I considered that a good thing. It made it better\n\nThe risk though, regardless of tolerance, is if it isn't mixed well and you get a hot spot. Then even Kurt Cobain would be a dead man. \ngrimgrau: Oh, I completely understand if the dope is stronger than usual even if it's fent, I mean, so long as it isn't the last time you use it of course if you get what I mean. If you use drugs and you get more bang for your buck you're probably going to see that as a bonus no matter which drug it is.\n\nI used to have a huge polysubstance addiction/abuse problem in my mid to late 20's for about 4 years, but my main choice of drug was anything psychedelic. I wasn't addicted to one drug. I was addicted to being altered, preferably on psychedelics. I tripped on so many things so often that to this day I still see motion trails any time something moves and haloes around lights. Fortunately that's it and it doesn't negatively interfere with my life, but when I found a hookup for LSD I ended up doing so much so often I wound up in the emergency room a few times having no fucking clue how I got there. I inherited some $20,000'ish in stocks and I blew almost all of it on LSD, weed, and electronics. Psychedelics aren't even supposed to be addictive. No physical addiction or withdrawal, but I got to the point where I couldn't make it through a week without tripping on something or otherwise getting high. Never messed with meth, cocaine/crack, or opiates though.\n\nI ended up in treatment a few times because of that. That's when I met people who had similar problems or were hooked on other things like heroin. So I know how tough it is. If my addiction had a physical dependence component where I'd go into physical withdrawal and felt like I was dying without getting high man, I don't even know what would have happened to me. It was bad enough that my mind and my emotions SCREAMED for me to need to be under the influence to get through a week or even a few days. SO glad that's in my past now.\n\nIt also doesn't help that it turns out that I also have bipolar disorder, but I've been stable on medications for a very long time now and have been slowly getting my life back in order. Fortunately for me I've been heading down a very good path for a long time, but I understand what it's like to be addicted and to be in treatment and everything. I've met some cool people along the way and hadn't seen them for years only to find out that they're no longer here.\n\nApart from finding medications that keep me 100% stable and fine, exercise has helped me through BIG TIME and ever since I've been regularly exercising in some way, at the very least always doing some sort of cardio.\n\nIf you ever have any questions about bodyweight fitness or just need to talk feel free to hit me up. I've been doing bodyweight exercise for 2 and 1/2 years now and I'm about to turn 35. I'm getting older and I'm at the point where I can't even imagine partying anymore. I need my sleep! I'm happy to answer any of your questions about this stuff or to just read whatever you have to say. If you don't feel comfortable replying in a comment you can send me a private message.\n\nIf there's anything that I can do to help no matter how small it is I feel like in some way I've been through some of the same shit and I'll respond to you even if it takes me a few days (I'm not always online.)\n\nTake care!\n", "prompt": "SweelFor: What is your mid/long term plan for BWF training?\nHi everyone\n\nFor these past few days I have been thinking about how I would like to structure my training in the mid/long term.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: If an online friend frequently apologizes for slow replies over text, what does this imply?\n[deleted]\nPonytail77: I think it implies that the apology really isn't that sincere.  If you are truly sorry you try not to repeat it again.   \n\nThis friend is aware she's ignored your texts and so is trying to be polite by opening her reply repeatedly with a \"I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but...\"  \n\nIt basically shows they're busy and/or have other priorities.\n[deleted]: What she wrote was, \"Hey! Sorry for not answering for a long time - I was on vacation outside the city and there was no connection.\" She was honest about it because I saw from her stories, though when she replied it was like nine days past the New Year and I texted her on NYE. With that being said, my texts have always been very long so whether or not she was sincere it probably didn't matter that much. There's been a general trend of her replying once every week. But I've also noticed that when I wrote something that she didn't felt comfortable answering, for example I asked her if she liked to watch any Halloween movies over Halloween, then she took a longer time to reply and then came back at the end of November and apologized for being very busy (but only after I accidentally liked one of her IG photos which probably sent a notification to her phone). It's true that she was busy with something but no one could have probably been that busy that they would take a long time to reply to a text.\n\nBtw I also confronted her about this and it got really messy. But I get the sense that she wants to send meaningful replies rather than just \"one or two word texts,\" as she put it. So she may not have been sincere with the apology but she is probably sincere with the conversation. But also a part of me can't help but wonder if she feels pressured to apologize for slow replies after I nearly set an ultimatum on the conversation. I mean she's apologized in the past before for slow replies but I get the sense that she is probably going to apologize more often now out of any lingering pressure that she feels from me. I tried my best to move on from the confrontation but when something like that happens it's hard to forget. Now she's been busier with her life than before but yeah, I keep looking at it from my perspective and it's hard to come to terms with it. Like what if this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly..\nPonytail77: \"...this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly\"\n\nFrom what you've said, I think this is the most likely answer. Rather than \"read between the lines\" as they say, she just takes her time in responding -politely of course- hoping you'll get the hint.\n[deleted]: But couldn't that have also been because my texts were very long? Maybe if my texts had been shorter she wouldn't have apologized?\n\nHere's a brief timeline of the texts: She replied on October 23. I replied on November 6. She replied on November 28. I replied on December 24. She replied on December 28. I replied on December 31. She replied on January 9. She started off her replies on November 28 and January 9 with apologies. I have not replied since. I have backed off by a lot already. Is it not enough??\nPonytail77: I would take a break until I heard from her.  Or at least another month or so. \n\nSounds like you want more from this friendship then she is willing or able to give right now.  If she's interested, she can reach out to you at any time too.\n[deleted]: That's what I was thinking too. Not just because she told me that she's starting a new job but also because I am not completely sure if I should open up more in my texts with her. What draws me to her is that she is able to answer in detail, with compassion, and with great energy. It's not like she answers in one to three sentences. Often she answers in five to ten sentences. It's clear that she puts effort into her messages even if her priorities have changed or whatnot, and as a result, I overshare with her sometimes.\n\nBut I am still unsure how much I actually matter to her. Any confrontation that involved making excessive demands would turn people off. Whether or not it's long term remains to be seen. She said she's not mad, and she said she still likes the communication. I believe her, but people can also subtly pull themselves away while still being very polite. Not to mention she lives in a foreign country where the main language isn't English. Of course she has an incentive to communicate in English.\n\nIf I still matter to her in some way or the other, then she'll eventually reach out like she did before. I hate to say this but this is my way of testing her. I hope to take a break and not reply to her until May and continue to do nothing (not watching her stories, not liking any of her posts). If she doesn't reach out again asking how I am doing before then like she used to that should say something about how she actually feels.\nDiabetaBun: \u201cI hope to take a break\u201d I think, is a good start. Not as far as testing her but for your own self. Whether she is being too kind to upkeep her conversation with you, or simply too busy, or find it hard to respond due to language limitations, whatever else the \u201cpossible\u201d explanation could be, it\u2019s always important to refrain from being emotionally codependent with or on another. Coming from a neutral standpoint, you can still have meaningful conversations with her and very much have an \u2018active\u2019 relationship while not expecting too much from it. It is pretty apparent that, at this current time, she is unable to meet your needs. That is okay. There is so much that we can do when it involves another but we do have control on how we choose to handle the situation. I suggest being open to others who can click with you and meet your needs. It won\u2019t minimize the respect you have for your friend and it will increase the respect you have for yourself.\n\nIn regards to the frequent apologies, it\u2019s kind of hard to say. It can be due to insecurities, or fear to disappoint, or it can be because she doesn\u2019t like late responses herself, or, on top of fear to disappoint, she just simply has an active life and she does feel bad to have anyone waiting on her because she believes on being that great friend. If that makes sense\u2026\n[deleted]: There's something else that she mentions more frequently than apologies, and that's starting almost every single text with a \"Hey!\" This is something that she has started doing ever since last October, right around the time when my overbearing attitude went to extremes. Maybe she just happened to pick up something new, but I wonder if using hey consistently is a good thing? I know starting a text with a \"hey\" is great because it's informal, but she's using this on every single text now. Could she be using this to maintain distance?\nDiabetaBun: 1.) Out if curiosity, how long have the two of you known each other? \n\n2.) We\u2019re splitting hairs at this point.\n\n3.) Social Media has downside effects on how people perceive what is appropriate in aspects that involve communication and interpersonal relationships. For example, it becomes an expectation/demand to receive a response. To expound further, if the sender of the text sees that the receiver has indeed seen the text but have not yet responded, it rises the senders anxiety levels which in turn may cause them to over think or over analyze. \n\nI\u2019m not saying anything negative so I hope you don\u2019t take it as such but rather consider this information and do something proactive about your perception on things in regards to sending and receiving texts or what the messages contain. Don\u2019t stress too much about it.\n\nIt seems you really enjoy her company and value her insights and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to distance ourselves from something we see as value. At this point, if it were me in your shoes, I would apologize for the demands I have made because it sets up unrealistic expectations for them and puts some sort of stress on the relationship whether it is big or small. From what you have shared thus far, it\u2019s very minor. So it\u2019s nothing really to worry about. Then I would proceed to share what I value in this relationship and set expectations or guidelines that I know I can live by (nothing on them to do but for myself to do). When that gets done, I would take a step back and just not expect anything else other than what has already been given to be expected. The sooner we can come to accept things for what they are, the sooner we can address the \u201cissue\u201d at hand and move on from it. \n\nJust a precaution, this is advice given by someone who is big on communication and being quite frank and upfront. I don\u2019t like \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d and walking around the bushes. It\u2019s just something I face everyday with people and found it necessary for me to be proactive in eliminating bs. This stuff works for ME and may not necessarily work for everyone.
