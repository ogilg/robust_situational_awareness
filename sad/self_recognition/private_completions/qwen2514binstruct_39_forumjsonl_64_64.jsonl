Economy is a funny thing and this could just result in a flat inflation, or even create dystopian lifestyle where the majority subsist in poor government housing, cared for but not really living.  Not to mention that right now we do still need  people to work. As the saying goes \"the world needs ditch diggers too\"\n\n\nI think we won't really see this hit until we move into a post-labor scarcity world.  We have already shifted economics in a time where many products only have artificial scarcity.  Music, movies, programs can all be copied indefinitely, even many physical products have little physical value.   With robotics and AI it seems that eventually we will reach the singularity, where base human labor is obsolete in all but the most niche areas.\nkuhzoo: &gt; UBI seems great, when wearing my idealist hat ...\n\nTo be fair though, that seems like the case for Communism, Capitalism, Democracy, Monarchy, Anarchism, etc.  Just sit back and listen to the tone of an amateur philosopher who's just read a book about one of the above and fallen in love with the idea of it.\n\nPersonally, I'm of the opinion that every system I listed above in it's pure form will fail for various reasons.  Capitalism devolves into monopolies. Communism gets co-opted by greed.  Democracies ham-string great individual leaders. Monarchies are brought down by one bad, or sometimes even mediocre, leader.  Anarchism doesn't really scale with population growth. ... And the flaws keep going.  At that point the solution to the draw-backs of one is to balance it with the benefits and draw-backs of another.  The US has historically been strongly capitalist, but there have often been mitigating communist/socialist policies, like The New Deal, eras with strong unions, etc. too.  \nAt which point we get back to UBI, and I see it as a dose of socialism to try to keep the draw-backs of capitalism in check.  (AFAICT, right now the US is running full steam toward the pure capitalism ending ... which would explain the rise in more socialist ideas.  People are trying to curve us back toward equilibrium.)\n\nOur idealized systems fail when they come into contact with reality where different people have different problems and priorities. Different enough problems and priorities that no one system will adequately support all of them.  Even using multiple systems to balance each other will still cause chafing and strife, but can prevent us from ever catastrophically failing the way, I believe, pure systems inevitably do.  Even the solution of 'balance' fails because someone always wants to unbalance it to get rid of their own pain points (or because they fell in love with an ideal).  \nThere is no one solution.  Like life, it's an ever shifting balance that collapses and fails if it goes too far toward any extreme or it can't adapt to it's changing environment.\ndid_you_read_it: There could be a future solution. Problem really is that all society is a pyramid (at best maybe a box). Under any scheme, doesn't matter if you're communist capitalist or socialist. \n\n\"The world needs ditch diggers too\"  The only difference is who ends up as one and why.\n\n*however* I think eventually we will reach the robotic singularity and we could build a human society where almost nobody is the base of the pyramid.  Propped up on a tireless army of robotic slave labor we could potentially achieve some aspect of these ideal governments. sure there will always be people at the \"bottom\" but when the bottom is 6 layers of robots up from the ground that could be some pretty cushy living.\nkuhzoo: Based on [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/extreme-poverty-america-un-special-monitor-report)^1 I don't think your robotic singularity will happen and if it does, it still won't make the changes you think it will.  There will be people either left behind without robots to support them, or there will still be tasks we can't fully automate that'll require humans down at the very bottom with the robots.  The US is the richest nation in the world by many estimates, and we have citizens living in conditions we would consider 'poor' in a 3rd world nation.\n\nYour ideal of a post-robotic singularity fails for the same reason all the other ideals fail, reality is too messy and inconsistent for everyone to fit into it... and many of those people who don't fit will be necessary to keep it going.\n\n1: warning link does not qualify as 'uplifting'\n", "prompt": "ratskim: Universal basic income seems to improve employment and well-being - The world\u2019s most robust study of universal basic income has concluded that it boosts recipients\u2019 mental and financial well-being, as well as modestly improving employment.\n\nw1n5t0nM1k3y: This study keeps getting cited,", "orig": "but seems to have a major flaw in regards to testing the UBI.

Since we can't define Mathematics within Mathematics, such a Metamaths represents a meta-creating space or awareness/consciousness which envelopes/contains a smaller/less-complex formal system (kind of like a Russian doll).\n\nSo following this logic, either there may be an infinite series of this kind of encapsulation or there's at least one encapsulation which holds the infinite while also remaining part of that infinite.\n\nHis claim regarding the *tools of Creation* had me thinking that such the recursion, inward or outward was infinite, but my position is that it doesn't have to be, as the Id is contained by the Ego and then both are contained within the Super Ego, but the Super Ego may only be infinitie possibility which the Ego then draws and manifests from (like Tesla's infinitie storehouse).\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I can't stop thinking about it!\njsticebeaver: this is the wrong lesson to take from godel's theorems.\n\nwhen viewed in historical context, like many other logicians and mathematicians godel was working on problems that david hilbert had put forth at the turn of the century. hilbert had hoped there could be a single system of proof such that a statement in mathematics was true if and only if it could be proven under that system.\n\nwhat godel did was demonstrate how for any possible system of proof, applied to any possible set of axioms, it was possible to construct a statement which was not provable (derivable by the rules of inference of the system) under that system, but which was intuitively true nonetheless, and provable under a different system (the construction godel follows in his theorem), he basically killed the idea of an absolute method of proof that could attain for us humans absolutely certain mathematical truth.\n\nhilbert's hope for a system of proof that would place mathematical truth in a pedestal of certainty above all other kinds of truth was pretty much given up from then on. you still hear professional mathematicians and popularizers speak of \"mathematical certainty\", but those are people who have not yet learned this lesson.\nGoldenrule-er: Cool. But no thoughts on my actual prompt? I understand you feel it's the \"wrong\" lesson to take from G\u00f6del's work on the Incompleteness Theorems, but say you were open to taking any lessons from anything, what then about what I've postulated in the initial comment? Thanks for you time!\njsticebeaver: I think what you wrote is wrong, but mainly it's not understandable\nGoldenrule-er: Can you share where you cease to follow? Like, where you begin to fail understanding? I might be able to reword/clarify/simplify. \ud83e\udd19\njsticebeaver: first you're speaking of mathematics and systems of deductive proof, then you go to Godel's conclusions about the limits of proof, and then you start a non-sequitor about a metamathematics that's a \"space of awareness\" and so on. I don't know what Godel's theorem has to do with a metamathematics that is a space of awareness\nGoldenrule-er: I see how that could be seen as a non sequitur. I suppose that, since mathematics is our most effective language for describing the world (it survives to describe when other languages fail) that the metamath(s) which can fully define our math(s) would represent a containing source, conceptually speaking. \n\nLike you can't have math if there wasn't also somewhere the thing which allows for it. You can't program in python if the base code didn't allow for the required entry. Maybe that's not the best example, as I'm not a programmer. You can't run \"OregonTrail.exe\" without first having what allows it to exist: the containing system of say MS-DOS. This type of relationship.  Oregon trail.exe cannot operate MS-DOS, but it can be operated within/by MS Dos.\n\nI intended to drive that connection home by referencing the Russian doll and how the id may be said to be contained by the ego and both of these may be contained by the super ego. I suppose I could've been more clear. Thanks for letting me know.\njsticebeaver: I disagree with you, in regards to the what mathematics is I'm a platonist or something. I think there's mathematical objects out there that aren't just thoughts in the minds of mathematicians, or structures present in mathematical languages, but that are objective and have objective features. Mathematics is the study of the necessary features of those objects, but like all studies of objective features of reality, there is no sense in which we can ever achieve complete truth and knowledge, so there isn't a thing such as a mathematics that is perfect and encapsulates our own mathematics. If there is such a thing, it's for the gods to know about, not us.\nGoldenrule-er: You are agreeing with me though. That's why I initially referred to such a *providing Mathematics* as that meta maths would be as the \"tools of Creation\". Your belief in the Ideal cannot be believed in if what we have here isn't a lesser Form of that Ideal. See what I mean, here? You're agreeing that this happens to be the case. Of there are qualitative differences, there must be qualitative levels (Russian doll again [where greater size allows for greater information/detail]). \n\nWho must have the ability to wield a meta mathematics if not meta-level beings? Everything that I've pointed to as far as awareness growing from the id to the ego and (although not for many of us) from the ego to the super ego suggests a processional capability for progressive growth of ability. Not for all, but for those who remain learning selves, anyway. It's not crazy to see such a design unfolding in this manner. What have we done since the digital revolution, but make ever-more realistic virtual spaces and immersive games? As above, so below. My curiosity is in this design as an infinite progression/recursion or instead there being some sort of Max Level. A Super-super ego and so on forever or the super ego as infinite nexus? Any thoughts on this?\njsticebeaver: Here's where I disagree but might seem to agree - that such a being can exist and meaningfully affect the world we live. I don't think this is the case, I think the claim that a supernatural being exists that knows the entirety of mathematics and has absolute knowledge of mathematics, is logically equivalent to a belief in the Greek or Roman gods. It's a form of the belief in supernatural limits to what we can know - supernatural because there are beings that can know beyond that limit, and if they shared it with us we could know it too.\nGoldenrule-er: I hear what you're saying and agree with you as far as it appears exactly the same as Greek or Roman beliefs in various patron gods of song and dance or the sea or fertility etc. Today we'd consider such beliefs as passing and nonsense. \n\nToday also, however, we design virtual worlds where people immerse their psyches and entertain the willing suspension of disbelief. Just because a programmer knows and writes in a language of which I know nothing about doesn't change the fact that I can treat what's before my eyes in a virtual reality simulation as real to me in that moment. This is the point I'm speaking to. The same relationship would apply to knowledge of a meta mathematics. \n\nThat programmer is levels above me in knowledge of a particular area, so by extension it's not unfeasible to believe that there are such levels of *capability* for learning, maintaining and employing levels of knowledge. \n\nWe have Holy books from the times of the Greeks and Romans that speak directly to godly design employment and communication from a meta level. Our oldest traditions such as Hinduism speak directly to a panpsychist design of our known reality which suggests the very same truth as our own individual progressing from id to ego to super ego: that for the psyche, there are varying levels of awareness of the same thing and varying levels of awareness may incorporate corresponding levels of ability to exercise   such awareness. \n\nWe see this is the various forms of mastery we see today in our daily life. NHL goalies have superhuman response times-- through familiarity and practice. People who practice a specialty better and more than others achieve greater levels of ability in such specialties. Whether a \"Rock God\" guitarist or a Olympic gymnast or a Hollywood Director, these show levels of achievement aren't limited as we continue to set new records in all of these areas within this space. \n\nMaths limit our ability to perform such feats within this space, but our own ability to outperform previous limits shows a mind component that could connect to limitless expansion toward Plato's World of Forms in the following way:\n\n There may be infinite numbers/values between 0 and 1. Perhaps 1 is that WoFs and they design everything between 0 and 1 as an encapsulated space designed-experientially in mathematics, for our experience, from the WoFs space of Meta-maths. Sure it's a long shot, but it does correspond to how we design and initiate encapsulated systems here, so it may not, in truth, be so nonsensical at all. \n\nThanks for your time, I know this was long.\njsticebeaver: &gt; The same relationship would apply to knowledge of a meta mathematics. \n\nNo, because a programmer programs a computer, which is a physical object, and the knowledge required to do that is conjectured explanations - not the kind of perfect knowledge the entity you posit possesses.\nGoldenrule-er: That is correct. I am attempting to show the physical relationship we have to define a virtual/perceptual/experiential space performs the same functional-relationship as a metaphysical to physical interactional/programming/design relationship might.  \n\nSomeone who is pure id cannot access the knowledge of the self awareness of the ego. Someone enslaved by their ego cannot know the experience of one who has risen above the tyranny of the ego and so has come to employ the ego for its own purposes. \n\nUnderstanding that the limitations of the beings we posit/embody may shift and change in such fashions as we incorporate greater forms of knowledge/learning is intended to portray the same functional-relationship a meta being would have with meta maths in comparison to our human being with *regular/standard maths*. \n\nThe id cannot comprehend the ego. The ego comprehends (encapsulates) the I'd, and may entertain the idea of the superego, but cannot comprehend (encapsulate) the super ego. The transcendence of these boundaries is made by the psyche. If we can go up in awareness and design for lesser levels of awareness (the influence or creation for egos and ids for example), why would it seem spurious that *they/meta beings* could not be doing the same for us?\n\nI realize that it's only obvious that we'd suggest our idea of any *higher plain of experience* must reflect that of what the design we inhabit suggests to us, but it does stand to reason, doesn't it?\n\nAlso, the computer is a physical object, but the information it operates with and shows upon the screen is *virtual* or conceptual. The rules and syntax of computer language is programmed systems that output information by the input of information. The abacus is physical, the digital computer works with physical transfers of electrons in the form of electricity to yield electronic outputs we then *virtually* read as a translation of physical input for *experiential value/virtual output* The one or zero of binary is *seen* as a physical \"one of zero\", but only in that a screen *displays* a one or a zero. We have not yet determined a physical nature for information (and may one day understand information as metaphysical [that part of the formal system which cannot be fully defined with that system, as G\u00f6del has shown us with the Incompleteness Theorems]).\njsticebeaver: First of all I just want to make clear that our knowledge of mathematics evolves. Mathematicians today know theorems and are able to produce proofs that mathematicians just 200 years ago didn't know how to. They understand what a proof is, what criteria proofs must meet to be accepted by the community, better than mathematicians did before. More than that, some things mathematicians thought before, are now known to be mistaken (case in point the universal system of proof that Godel showed was impossible).\n\nSo mathematics isn't what mathematicians think is true about numbers and sets and so on. Mathematicians have no authority over what mathematics is, they are just the people that in any given culture, generations and so on study mathematics. When the beliefs of mathematicians change regarding what's true and what is not in mathematics, those changes carry no authority and the matter of the truth or falsity of those beliefs remains unchanged, it's an objective property independent of who holds the beliefs, be it a studied professor or a graduate student.\n\nIt's not like you can define mathematics as the body of beliefs about numbers that mathematicians have, and then you define a superset of that which is comprised of all the abstract real true beliefs about numbers that only a supernatural being could have and be aware of.\nGoldenrule-er: I believe I hear you. This is indeed a topic regarding the philosophy of Mathematics rather than Mathematics itself. Of course beliefs don't change the happenstance of veracity or falsehood regarding proofs etc. No one is claiming such a super set as a *true belief*. I'm trying to say that G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems appear to point to the necessity of such an enveloping/containing source-- as no formal system may be completely defined within its own system. It appears to be the case if his proofs are proofs, right? Unless maybe it's just pure intuitional pulling from the infinite (as we have with all creative endeavors which have come from ideas).\n\nSo it would appear that Mathematics itself/physics itself, having no findable foundations as proven by G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems, also means there are no findable foundations *without the introduction of a meta-maths*. If this were to be true (and it may indeed be impossible to know this unless perhaps in dreamspace or something of the like) then such a meta-maths would literally represent \"the tools of Creation\". That the meta-maths contains or Martha would then make any user/programmer/metamathematician supernatural, in the true sense of the word, *to us*. \n\nSo what I trying to say here? No trouble with truth and falsity, only a logical playout. It is also always possible there is an entirely separate factual/actual logical playout(s) for which we have not accessed any knowledge of yet whatsoever, but it happens to be the case and always has been since our maths were discovered/created within the metamaths. \n\nThat said, I also like the bottom up idea where we make the higher forms from the lesser. As in the case of binary birthing so many forms of evolved programming languages, yet this route is moot given that zero and one fall within our accessible maths and so the metamaths provider becomes necessary once again as the Incompleteness Theorems appear to call for a meta-maths as necessary, you know?\njsticebeaver: &gt; No one is claiming such a super set as a true belief. I'm trying to say that G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems appear to point to the necessity of such an enveloping/containing source\n\nNo, the exact opposite is true, Godel's construction shows that such an enveloping/containing source is impossible. Godel doesn't show or suggest what the nature of mathematics is, instead he proves that the nature of mathematics IS NOT that there exists an all enveloping container which holds all mathematical systems that cannot by themselves be consistent and complete.\n\nHe shows there cannot be such a necessity as an enveloping source for all mathematics known to man. That source was believed to be necessary before Godel's work, and Godel became iconic for showing that intuition was false, and that not only there was no such necessity, but that there couldn't possibly be.\n\n&gt; So it would appear that Mathematics itself/physics itself, having no findable foundations as proven by G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems, also means there are no findable foundations without the introduction of a meta-maths. If this were to be true (and it may indeed be impossible to know this unless perhaps in dreamspace or something of the like) then such a meta-maths would literally represent \"the tools of Creation\". That the meta-maths contains or Martha would then make any user/programmer/metamathematician supernatural, in the true sense of the word, to us. \n\nThis meta-maths doesn't exist. Show me an example of it. For example, I could show you Godel's theorem and it would be an example of mathematics as we know it. But you couldn't show me an example of that meta-maths, because it doesn't exist. If it did exist, then you could show me. But you can't.\nGoldenrule-er: On the first point you've just basically misunderstood the ramifications of the Incompleteness Theorems and there nothing In aware of that I can do to help you with that here.\n\nOn the second point you're fundamentally missing out on the fact that such a metamaths cannot be shown *here*. In effect, you're saying \"if the whole world exists outside of my house how come you can't prove it by bringing it inside my house?\" The world cannot fit in your house. Your house is dependant on the whole world, not the other way around.\njsticebeaver: I have not. You're making a baseless speculation in my eyes, where you are attempting to save the pre-Godelian idea that mathematics can be put on a solid foundation from which all mathematical truths can be deduced, an all containing source. Godel showed this idea was mistaken. Upon Godel's refutation of this idea, you are reimagining the kind of secure source of all mathematics in a way that maybe his predecessor hadn't thought of, but you are still making the same mistake that Godel unveiled.\nGoldenrule-er: Thank you for clarifying. What I'm trying to communicate is that what G\u00f6del unveiled is that it's impossible to *bring the world into the house* so there's indeed no finding or bringing such Metamechanics here as they do not write in a language which may be shown in our programming language (regular/*our* maths) so to speak. Given he showed there's always a backdoor to a larger system which then fully defines the smaller system, so it it is that he's not proving that the meta-maths don't exist, but that they cannot exist here. Just as physics may show us the conceptual understandings of 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on dimensions, so can this suggestion/logical-deduction be entertained/imagined as a possibility realizable *somewhere else* while also not being realized within *our* shared space.\njsticebeaver: I don't think it can, not in the sense of it being a problem of understanding that you can make progress in, since by definition that thing is not realized in our physical reality, where only a small proportion of all mathematical truths can be understood and known by us.\n\nBy your explanation, any kind of variant of a metamechanics as the one you have in mind is \"impossible to bring the world into the house\", and that \"there is indeed no finding or bringing such Metamechanics here\". The case for us coming to know and understand a Methamechanics of this kind is a case of a proposition which we do know can never be known, by any means, as long as we're humans in the physical world, which you agree is the case.\n\nSo all ideas of what that thing is, all arguments made about that thing and why it matters, including yours, all those would be arbitrary and eventually uninteresting to the people involved. To the point, nowadays that's out of fashion. It was in fashion maybe up until Bertrand Russel.\n\nOn the other hand, it's also true that the mathematics we know today is going to look like kid play for people in thousands of years, but that advance will not be made in a single discovery, it will happen gradually as people conquer more paroquial problems, and from solving some of those, answers with larger reach will shape the growth of knowledge. For us to understand that it would be like if some of the earliest homo sapiens to have ever existed somehow appeared fully conscious and alive in Times Square this afternoon. They would be left without comprehension and wouldn't be able to understand what they were seeing and experiencing.\n", "prompt": "BernardJOrtcutt: /r/philosophy Open Discussion Thread | March 21, 2022\nWelcome to this week's Open Discussion Thread.

{"full_text": "SweelFor: What is your mid/long term plan for BWF training ?\nHi everyone\n\nFor these past few days I have been thinking about how I would like to structure my training in the mid/long term. I know what my short term training structure is and I know when it's gonna end and I was wondering what I wanted to do next.\n\nCurrently I am finishing Level 1 of Calisthenic Movement's program. There are 5 levels and going through 1 to 5 takes about 1 year and a few months I think.\n\nWhen I'll have completed CM's program I don't think I'll get on skills training. It seems a lot of people start calisthenics and quickly want to start training levers, planche, etc. It seems wiser to me to train basic movements strength for a few years before training the levers or planche. Would you agree ? I like to take some perspective and remind myself that I want to train for strength, looks, etc, but also longevity and I think in 20 years when I'll look back, waiting 2 or 3 years before training hard BW skills will seem like nothing and I'll be happy with my decisions.\n\nI think I'd be interested after CM's program by GMB's floor program to learn basic locomotion movements and develop further body awareness.\n\nAfter that, I don't know.\n\n\nWhat are your plans for future training ? \nJPSYCHC: Start \ngrimgrau: I'm wishing you some luck and sending you good vibes so you can follow through and start working out.\n\nMay I ask what you feel has been keeping you from starting?\nJPSYCHC: I'm coming out of a heroin addiction I am only 10 days clean but I finally feel good physically. \ngrimgrau: 10 days clean from heroin is still a difficult thing to accomplish. Every day, even every hour for a long time past 10 days can stretch on for eternity. I've known many people who became addicted to opiates and opioids and it's really tough. Getting through the withdrawals seems to be like absolute hell.\n\nIf you didn't know already there's an awful lot of research out there that shows that cardiovascular exercise can help a ton with recovery, though. Strength training is also a big help, but from what I've read and heard it's the cardio that seems to do the most good.\n\nIf you can even bring yourself to do just a few exercises at first that'll still be great. You don't necessarily have to do the entire routine the first few times through.\n\nHere's hoping you can continue on the path to recovery. :)\nJPSYCHC: Thanks man. I think I can even though I have failed so many times already. I appreciate this \ngrimgrau: The important thing is that you're trying again even though you haven't succeeded before. Like I said it's really tough to get off of heroin and I know full well that you know that. The addiction is so fucking insidious. The way it hijacks your brain is just evil.\n\nIs it possible that you may be able to get into some sort of medication maintenance program? I know that those programs have pretty strict rules, but I've known some people who were able to get off of the heroin by taking suboxone or methadone for a while and then, eventually, taper off.\n\nSome people need to be on it long-term, but in some cases that can be a lot better than having to go out and think about how to score more heroin. Firstly, it eliminates the illegality of possession and some of the stuff people might do in order to score. Secondly, there's a LOT of cut heroin out there these days. There's no telling what might be in the stuff and with the crap that some people are cutting it with one shot, sniff, or smoke could mean instant death. Fentanyl and carfentanyl are outright instant killers compared to heroin on its own.\n\nWhatever path you choose I wish you the best of luck.\nJPSYCHC: I am on suboxone and in an IOP\n\nMy dope had fent in it, I know because I tested positive for it regularly. But believe it or not in my state, I considered that a good thing. It made it better\n\nThe risk though, regardless of tolerance, is if it isn't mixed well and you get a hot spot. Then even Kurt Cobain would be a dead man. \ngrimgrau: Oh, I completely understand if the dope is stronger than usual even if it's fent, I mean, so long as it isn't the last time you use it of course if you get what I mean. If you use drugs and you get more bang for your buck you're probably going to see that as a bonus no matter which drug it is.\n\nI used to have a huge polysubstance addiction/abuse problem in my mid to late 20's for about 4 years, but my main choice of drug was anything psychedelic. I wasn't addicted to one drug. I was addicted to being altered, preferably on psychedelics. I tripped on so many things so often that to this day I still see motion trails any time something moves and haloes around lights. Fortunately that's it and it doesn't negatively interfere with my life, but when I found a hookup for LSD I ended up doing so much so often I wound up in the emergency room a few times having no fucking clue how I got there. I inherited some $20,000'ish in stocks and I blew almost all of it on LSD, weed, and electronics. Psychedelics aren't even supposed to be addictive. No physical addiction or withdrawal, but I got to the point where I couldn't make it through a week without tripping on something or otherwise getting high. Never messed with meth, cocaine/crack, or opiates though.\n\nI ended up in treatment a few times because of that. That's when I met people who had similar problems or were hooked on other things like heroin. So I know how tough it is. If my addiction had a physical dependence component where I'd go into physical withdrawal and felt like I was dying without getting high man, I don't even know what would have happened to me. It was bad enough that my mind and my emotions SCREAMED for me to need to be under the influence to get through a week or even a few days. SO glad that's in my past now.\n\nIt also doesn't help that it turns out that I also have bipolar disorder, but I've been stable on medications for a very long time now and have been slowly getting my life back in order. Fortunately for me I've been heading down a very good path for a long time, but I understand what it's like to be addicted and to be in treatment and everything. I've met some cool people along the way and hadn't seen them for years only to find out that they're no longer here.\n\nApart from finding medications that keep me 100% stable and fine, exercise has helped me through BIG TIME and ever since I've been regularly exercising in some way, at the very least always doing some sort of cardio.\n\nIf you ever have any questions about bodyweight fitness or just need to talk feel free to hit me up. I've been doing bodyweight exercise for 2 and 1/2 years now and I'm about to turn 35. I'm getting older and I'm at the point where I can't even imagine partying anymore. I need my sleep! I'm happy to answer any of your questions about this stuff or to just read whatever you have to say. If you don't feel comfortable replying in a comment you can send me a private message.\n\nIf there's anything that I can do to help no matter how small it is I feel like in some way I've been through some of the same shit and I'll respond to you even if it takes me a few days (I'm not always online.)\n\nTake care!\n", "prompt": "SweelFor: What is your mid/long term plan for BWF training ?\nHi everyone\n\nFor these past few days I have been thinking about how I would like to structure my training in the mid/long term.

{"full_text": "FullyVaccinatedCat: CMV: You should take the vaccine\nI don't understand why anyone would refuse the vaccine. It's literally free, safe, and effective against Covid-19.\n\nThe data shows that the vaccines are keeping us safe right now from the virus. And there are high [hospitalization rates for unvaccinated areas](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/18/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html). And the vaccine is [effective](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/15/health/cdc-covid-risk-higher-unvaccinated/index.html). Now whether or not it should be mandates necessarily is up for debate but I think the people should want to take it.\n\nI am open-minded to understanding this. My cousin is anti-vaxx and I tried talking to him. But he gave me a bunch of nonsense about how the media, government, and politicians are trying to force people to take it. Even if this was true, why not just do what they say? It causes no harm and will make being a wage slave easier, right?\n\nYou, the reader, should get vaccinated. Unless you have some health condition that prevents you from taking it, ordered by a medical professional, or unless you're a child, you need to roll up your sleeves and get vaccinated.\n\n(My mind has been changed. Perhaps the vaccine isn't for everyone)\nanti1media: If you are vaccinated, you shouldn\u2019t care about others vaccination status. That is the whole point of a functional vaccine and personal choice. The only reason someone needs is \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d. A simple \u201cno\u201d would suffice. Their bodily autonomy is not your concern. You taking the vaccine doesn\u2019t protect anyone but yourself. Therefore, they only hurt themselves.\n\nMy problem isn\u2019t the vaccine or the unvaccinated. My problem is the government thinking it\u2019s their job to enforce and threaten a mandate and loss of employment. Taking away a persons job is akin to killing them. It is disgustingly immoral and unethical. I did not vote for people to have them demand I shove a needle in my arm by threat or intimidation.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; You taking the vaccine doesn\u2019t protect anyone but yourself. \n\nWrong. It affects those around you who can\u2019t be vaccinated and it creates other variants which will affect everyone. You are dead wrong.\nanti1media: The people that can\u2019t get vaccinated can always continue wearing masks and distancing. No one is stopping them from protecting themselves.\n\nCovid is animal transmissible. New variants will form regardless. If 100% of the world was vaccinated, covid would not disappear or stop mutating. You\u2019re wrong.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; The people that can\u2019t get vaccinated can always continue wearing masks and distancing. \n\nYou said the vaccine only protects the person who gets it. That\u2019s patently false. And the vaccine is IMMENSELY more effective than the *other* person wearing a mask. Remember the primary function of masks is to stop sick people from spreading it. This unvaccinated maskless person is putting anyone he comes in contact with in danger if that person can\u2019t get vaccinated. That other person wearing a mask will only marginally help them. \n\n&gt; No one is stopping them from protecting themselves.\n\nThis is what you need to understand. **They cannot protect themselves**. \n\n&gt; New variants will form regardless. \n\nNo they won\u2019t. Not if cases are low enough. Variation comes through spread. Less spread, less variation.\nanti1media: 1. The vaccine only protects the person who takes it is categorically true. While vaccinated you can still catch and spread the virus at seemingly the exact same rates. While some areas around the world are showing higher infection rates while vaccinated. If the point is to protect those who can\u2019t get vaccinated\u2026 but you can still spread the virus while vaccinated\u2026 tell me what it is stopping? It\u2019s stopping symptoms from occurring and allowing people to spread it at a higher rate without recognition of even being infected.\n\n2. You\u2019re 100% wrong. Fauci and the CDC have already made the statement about variants and agree with me. This virus is animal transmissible and SARS is already a mutated animal virus to begin with.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; While vaccinated you can still catch and spread the virus at seemingly the exact same rates.\n\nWrong. Quit pretending to be a scientist. You\u2019re fucking it up. Vaccinated people *can* become just as contagious as unvaccinated people. But the RATE that vaccinated people have breakthrough infections is IMMENSELY lower than unvaccinated people. \n\n&gt; You\u2019re 100% wrong. Fauci and the CDC have already made the statement about variants and agree with me.\n\nProve it. [Because he\u2019s pretty unequivocal here](https://www.deseret.com/platform/amp/coronavirus/2021/10/10/22716452/dr-fauci-new-covid-19-variant-spread). Vaccines and social distancing are how to stop new variants.\nanti1media: Surprise, your wrong. Again. Unvaccinated can\u2019t have breakthrough infections. Seeing as breakthrough infections strictly refers to people that are vaccinated getting infections. You don\u2019t understand the phrases you are using. Which tells me you\u2019re mimicking words from someone else and doing no research on your own.\n\nFauci did an interview where he explicitly stated that every person alive could be vaccinated and the virus would not go away because of animal transmissibility. To which other scientists have greatly agreed. Let\u2019s pretend you have no degree but have lots of common sense. If you are vaccinated but no animals are, and they can still catch it.. will it go away? Or will it continue to mutate? Let\u2019s remember the original cause of covid and the original theory that it evolved in bats to begin with.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; Unvaccinated can\u2019t have breakthrough infections\n\n\u2026I never said they did. You are quite lost. Or your reading comprehension is subpar. It should be obvious to any functionally literate person that I was comparing breakthrough infections in vaccinated people to infections rates among unvaccinated. \u201cBreakthrough infection\u201d automatically only means vaccinated people. \n\n&gt; You don\u2019t understand the phrases you are using.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I lost you here. You said \u201cWhile vaccinated you can still catch and spread the virus at seemingly the exact same rates.\u201d That is patently false. Breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are MUCH lower than regular infections in unvaccinated people. \n\n&gt; Fauci did an interview where he explicitly stated that every person alive could be vaccinated and the virus would not go away because of animal transmissibility. \n\n1. Cite that. \n\n2. Explain how that affects herd immunity. \n\n3. Square that with his explicit recommendation (which I cited) that says everyone should get vaccinated and social distance in order to stop new variants.\nNoRecommendation8689: If a vaccinated person catches covid and an unvaccinated person catches covid they will transmit the virus to other people at exactly the same rates. The difference is that the vaccinated person won't know that they are contagious, while the unvaccinated person will at least have some indication that they are sick. There has been almost no asymptomatic transmission of covid. What there have been is very mild symptom transmission or an even more rare cases pre-symptomatic transmission. People who never become symptomatic at all do not transmit the disease, unless they're vaccinated.\nphilly_steak_cheese: &gt; If a vaccinated person catches covid and an unvaccinated person catches covid they will transmit the virus to other people at exactly the same rates.\n\nBut that unvaccinated person is SIX times more likely to catch it in the first place. \n\n&gt; while the unvaccinated person will at least have some indication that they are sick. \n\nNot true. Most covid is *spread* before the victim shows any symptoms. Even if they ultimately die. That\u2019s how insidious this virus is. We\u2019ve known this for over a year. Where have you been?\n\n&gt; There has been almost no asymptomatic transmission of covid. \n\nThat is patently false. \n\n&gt; People who never become symptomatic at all do not transmit the disease,\n\n[Utterly false.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20people%20who,designed%20to%20prevent%20spread.)\n\n* \u201cIn fact, people who are infected may be more likely to spread the illness if they are asymptomatic.\u201d\nNoRecommendation8689: The most extensive study on this to date showed a 0.3 asymptomatic transmission rate, and that was amongst people known to have covid and known to where the covid came from. You are just absolutely wrong and you haven't bothered to read anything that the CDC just hasn't spoon-fed directly into your mouth.\nphilly_steak_cheese: Show me your source. You have yet to do that with any of your spamming. I\u2019ve given you half a dozen sources and you just plug your ears and go \u201clalalalala.\u201d\n\n1. I suspect 0.3 asymptomatic transmission refers to people who NEVER got symptoms. Most asymptotic transmission was PRE symptom. So they wouldn\u2019t be in that group since they were ultimately NOT asymptomatic. \n\n2. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to really track asymptomatic spread because, shockingly, asymptomatic people don\u2019t tend to get tested and traced.\nNoRecommendation8689: And you post summaries from CBS news, the organization that literally photoshopped a handgun out of the frame to pretend like the police that shot the perpetrator wasn't justified. Pardon me for not believing them, or you for that matter.\nphilly_steak_cheese: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7044e1.htm?s_cid=mm7044e1_w\nNoRecommendation8689: So you're just going to ignore my link now?

{"full_text": "akosgi: Truth be told: You probably have ego problems.\nYep, even you.\n\nA common misconception is that having a big ego is reserved for people who think highly of themselves. Sure, they have big egos, but believe it or not, your self-loathing-ass probably does too.\n\nThe concept I'm trying to convey here is when you fill your own head with thoughts of yourself constantly, be them negative or positive, it all constitutes a big ego. Over time, you create this self-image that you become tied to, and thus, it becomes fragile. And, due to this big fragile ego, you refuse to take the actions necessary to get outcomes you desire, because your head is so over-inflated with thoughts of yourself that you aren't giving your thought space the necessary room to interact with and understand the rest of the world. Your subconscious is terrified of anything that can challenge this fragile ego, and so you freak out at the thought of stepping outside your comfort zone and putting yourself out there.\n\nCouple points:\n\n- You're not that important. The only person thinking so much about you is YOU. And the more you think about yourself and how you suck at social skills, are ugly, are afraid of rejection, are this/that, the less you can think about the people around you who you actually WANT to interact with. (disclaimer: because I know some pedant in the comments is gonna bring this up: this isn't targeting those who genuinely DON'T want to interact with others. But seriously, why are y'all on /r/socialskills if your goal isn't to interact with others?)\n\n- When you switch your perspective to learning about and understanding the people and world around you - even in ways that it doesn't affect you - you'll see a profound change in the way you exist. Sure, you'll get rejected. But you'll realize that *it doesn't fucking matter.* You're not so important that this rejection is the end of some great value you brought to the table. \n\n- Approach the world seeking to learn from it and contribute to it. If you have nothing to contribute, learn. If you have nothing to learn, contribute. If you have both, do both.\n\n**TLDR:** The long and short of it is that the more you think about yourself, whether it's good or bad thoughts, the less you're thinking about others and the world around you. I hope this helps some people get over social hurdles that they constructed themselves.\n\n*edit:* Wanted to add a section about actually changing these things. Whenever I feel like something is \"easier said than done,\" or \"hard bc I've been this way all along,\" I call upon a very simple concept: discipline. As I stated in a comment, discipline is doing something that sucks, but you know is good for you, even when you don't want to. And \"not having discipline\" is a cop-out, since it literally is just doing things when you don't want to. There is no great chasm between zero and one. Do or do not, there is no try. You'll never get it if you don't start it, and you'll never have it if you don't keep at it. So discipline yourself to stop your spiraling negative thought processes - meditate, learn to harness your mind and stop letting negative thoughts fill your head. Discipline yourself to go to the gym even when you're tired as shit. Discipline yourself to go and talk to the person you're nervous to talk to, even when you don't want to. Just do it. There's no rocket science here, it's just a matter of doing until it becomes habit. Good luck!\nSunkenStone: I've seen this concept of 'the self-loathing are actually secret narcissists' increasingly frequently, and, since you seem to have bought into it hard, you're as good a person as any to ask: What good comes from this framing? Is it intended to spur the self-loathing into action by adding another item to their list of flaws? Is its purpose to justify those who reject the self-loathing by saying, 'It's okay, they were a narcissist anyway.' Who benefits?\nakosgi: The point is this ego discussion is a starting point from which the rest of their self-declared \"flaws\" will stem from - and addressing it makes things simpler. But they have to want to change, of course. And that goes back to ego.\n\nIdeally, everyone benefits. They get over themselves, they get over their self-loathing, and everyone they interact with enjoys their company, and it becomes a positive feedback loop of life.\nSunkenStone: &gt; The point is this ego discussion is a starting point from which the rest of their self-declared \"flaws\" will stem from\n\nWhat do you mean by this? That the idea is to make 'you have a massive ego' the central flaw in a self-loathing person's mind? You state the ideal outcomes, but none of them rely on this specific framing being at the root of things.\nakosgi: You're greatly simplifying what I'm saying to fit your narrative against my theme.\n\nThe point is, the more time and mind space you waste on thinking about yourself, the less time and mind space you have on learning and growing from the world around you. When you enter social interactions, you want to have a growth and contribution mentality to see things through. For many, it requires understanding that when they're spending so much time thinking about themselves, it's an ego problem, and this initiates a different train of thought than their status quo.\n\nIt's a pedant's exercise to look at a single element of the overall message and attempt to completely discredit the value around it. I wrote another post specifically for pedants that do this:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/iydnj9/protip_not_everyone_will_say_things_exactly_how/\n\nAnd as an aside, if you're not seeing the amount of responses that have said this has actually helped them think differently about the way they are and it's working for them, then that's on you.\nSunkenStone: When your initial post is so nebulous, it makes sense to want to \"simplify\" it to something concrete so it can be parsed properly. I have no problem with this:\n\n&gt;  The more time and mind space you waste on thinking about yourself, the less time and mind space you have on learning and growing from the world around you. When you enter social interactions, you want to have a growth and contribution mentality to see things through.\n\nI do have a problem with this:\n\n&gt; For many, it requires understanding that when they're spending so much time thinking about themselves, it's an ego problem, and this initiates a different train of thought than their status quo.\n\nThe way you originally phrased this in your OP was indistinguishable from a description of narcissism. True narcissists, people with NPD, are commonly understood to be unfixable, fundamentally flawed people. [This comic](https://old.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/rbuw44/truth_be_told_you_probably_have_ego_problems/hnsr3qd/), which you responded positively to, shows the much more likely outcome of telling a self-loathing person that they're actually incredibly vain. It doesn't spur them to action, it creates another layer of paralyzing shame.\n\nYou seem partial to calling people pedants, both in this comment section and in the past. Isn't that a bit hypocritical coming from you? Shouldn't these people who are getting flack for phrasing their advice in frankly abusive ways (or \"behind a wall of negativity\" as you would put it) just discipline themselves and make their messaging more palatable? Especially when the unpleasant bits are unnecessary for getting the theme across. Or does discipline only apply to one's self and you can't call on other people to practice it? I get that in a \"I can only control my actions and my reaction to the world and I have to make the best of that\" way, but this specific instance does have a bit of doormat energy.\n\nWith regards to your aside, I'm not responding here because I have some abstract notion that this could hypothetically be bad. When I was a lot less stable, things like your first two paragraphs in the OP and the comic linked above were directly and severely harmful to my mental well-being. I don't deny that it helps some people. I just have doubts that the number of people it helps and the degree to which it helps them outweighs the number of people it harms and the degree to which it harms them. That's why I bothered commenting in the first place; I just don't see how this could help more people than it hurts.\nakosgi: Alright, I got time today.\n\nPoint 1:\n\n&gt;The way you originally phrased this in your OP was indistinguishable from a description of narcissism.\n\nThis is a straw man of my discussion, and then an attack on that straw man. I have not claimed them to be narcissists, and am therefore not saying they are unfixable, fundamentally flawed people. Then again, I was never outright accused of the narcissists stuff, so there is plausible deniability to claim that's not what was being insinuated. But one can infer.\n\nPoint 2:\n\n&gt;This comic, which you responded positively to, shows the much more likely outcome of telling a self-loathing person that they're actually incredibly vain. It doesn't spur them to action, it creates another layer of paralyzing shame.\n\nThis is not how I interpreted this comic. I read it as this person found it so profound that they are actually taking the time to process it. Interpretations differ.\n\nPoint 3:\n\n&gt;Shouldn't these people who are getting flack for phrasing their advice in frankly abusive ways (or \"behind a wall of negativity\" as you would put it) just discipline themselves and make their messaging more palatable? \n\nOf course. But then, shortly thereafter,\n\n&gt;I get that in a \"I can only control my actions and my reaction to the world and I have to make the best of that\" way\n\nSo the solution was basically discussed immediately. And then finally, this thought is ended with \n\n&gt;this specific instance does have a bit of doormat energy.\n\nwhich is, again, a personal interpretation of this. Taking it with such a negative connotation is exactly against the prior citation that I made.\n\nPoint 4:\n\n&gt;I'm not responding here because I have some abstract notion that this could hypothetically be bad\n\nBut then,\n\n&gt;things like your first two paragraphs in the OP and the comic linked above were directly and severely harmful to my mental well-being\n\nThese two sentences conflict with each other. \n\n&gt;I just have doubts that the number of people it helps and the degree to which it helps them outweighs the number of people it harms and the degree to which it harms them\n\nThe overall popularity of this post begs to differ. But also, that statement is in direct contraction with\n\n&gt;I'm not responding here because I have some abstract notion that this could hypothetically be bad.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm unsure as to what the point of all this is.\n\nedited for format\nSunkenStone: To clarify, I am explicitly saying that you have portrayed the self-loathing as narcissists. I don't think you need to say it directly in order to have done so, either. If I described someone as, \"having a head so over-inflated with thoughts of themselves that they aren't giving their thought space the necessary room to interact with and understand the rest of the world; their subconscious is terrified of anything that can challenge this fragile ego,\" I would be describing a narcissist. The unfixable, fundamentally flawed part follows from this. If you can't see why I think this implication exists, I thank you for reading but I don't think we'll be able to come to any sort of resolution.\n\nMy point about controlling your own actions goes along with \"does discipline only apply to one's self and you can't call on other people to practice it\". I'm saying that asking people to tolerate the \"wall of negativity\" in order to find the sections of good advice when the advice giver could have simply not put the negativity in, effectively demanding discipline from one's self while not requiring it of others, is doormat-like.\n\nMy last paragraph is not contradictory. I'm saying that I'm not someone merely theorizing that this could hurt people. I know for a fact that it can because things near identical to it did hurt me in the past. Furthermore, because I know it can hurt people, that makes me question whether or not this helps more people than it hurts.\n\nMy overall point is that telling people that if they hate themselves it's actually a sign that they're a terrible person is reckless, and that this implication didn't need to be in your post at all to make it effective. Changing the faux tough love title to something else and just including everything from \"Couple points\" to the end would result in a post with the same impact, from my point of view. For the record I'm not trying to get you to change your post because you're right that it drew a lot of engagement.\nakosgi: Point 1:\n\n&gt;To clarify, I am explicitly saying that you have portrayed the self-loathing as narcissists.\n\nAlright, I appreciate you clarifying. Thanks to this, saying \n\n&gt;The unfixable, fundamentally flawed part follows from this.\n\nIs textbook straw man fallacy - you are purposely misrepresenting my argument (and then applying extraneous characteristics to my argument) in order to present an attack. If anything, I spend copious amounts of effort on this sub attempting to help people change and grow themselves, because I don't believe they are fundamentally flawed or unfixable. You're right, we won't come to resolution here because your interpretation is not fact, so stop presenting it like it is.\n\nPoint 2:\n\n&gt;\"does discipline only apply to one's self and you can't call on other people to practice it\".\n\nYou cannot discipline someone else. You can suggest discipline but not force them to act differently.\n\n&gt;effectively demanding discipline from one's self while not requiring it of others, is doormat-like.\n\nAgain, you keep spewing this interpretation as if I'm supposed to agree. It's not fact. And what's worse is that you have stated before: \n\n&gt;\"I can only control my actions and my reaction to the world and I have to make the best of that\"\n\nSo you clearly understand the constructive theme that I'm attempting to convey, but are actively ignoring it for the sake of argument.\n\nPoint 3:\n\n&gt;telling people that if they hate themselves it's actually a sign that they're a terrible person\n\nThis is not what I've done, but again, you seem to be very loose with your interpretations of my words.\n\nPoint 4:\n\n&gt;Changing the faux tough love title to something else and just including everything from \"Couple points\" to the end would result in a post with the same impact, from my point of view.\n\nIf all this detracted so much, then the post, its current state, wouldn't have received such a positive response.\n\nPoint 5:\n\n&gt;For the record I'm not trying to get you to change your post because you're right that it drew a lot of engagement.\n\nThis is an outright lie. You can't spend an entire post attempting to disassemble my post then end it with this sentence as a CYA. \n\nPoint 6:\n\nIf your overall focus was \n\n&gt;I just have doubts that the number of people it helps and the degree to which it helps them outweighs the number of people it harms and the degree to which it harms them.\n\nThen it shows how shoddy an argument you're making, due to how you've been actively seeking to spin everything in the most disgusting, incendiary, and vicious interpretations possible. I'll admit that some of it is blunt, but when someone actively misinterprets and misrepresents a statement to twist what's been said, misses the actionable advice and resolutions, and then harms themselves (either physically or mentally) because of their twisted interpretation, that's out of anyone's control but that person. \n\nSummary:\n\nI'm sorry that you're doing this and have a thought space where you feel the need to do this, and do hope you, or anyone you're speaking for, can heal and be better.\nSunkenStone: I'm not going to dignify a comment that ends with a \"who hurt you sweatie\"-type remark with a real response, and I'm exceedingly glad I refrained from mentioning the exact nature of the harm I experienced.

I've used it many times before to create glow food, I made these yellow glow noodles with them for example: http://imgur.com/KrjxXe8 or this green glow jelly:http://i.imgur.com/XGRBfSR.gifv. You can also make Turmeric UV reactive by adding pure alcohol to it btw! Not to use in food though, but other glow experiments :). \njagedlion: If you are using to use high proof EtOH (I used everclear), another really cool one is just mint. (I guess any other plant, but mint is actually tasty)  I don't have a great pic on my phone, just a boring one.  But chlorophyll, while UV opaque, also fluoresces purple-red.  So if you shine the beam on them, while none of the light penetrates, the surface where the beam is aimed turns from green to glowing red.  It's quite striking, but the fluorescence seems to pretty much vanish if you add water.\n\nI still haven't found something that keeps a nice red glow in aqueous solvents.\nPhotoandGrime: XD Hahaha cheers, I know this too! I have a youtube channel dedicated to glow stuff hehe. I made UV reactive cupcakes with chlorophyll: http://i.imgur.com/Oo7s319.gifv. Green in normal light, pink in black light. I have two recipes in which I used chlorophyll online. You can extract chlorophyll with oil, butter or pure alcohol. Unfortunately the pure alcohol version isn't edible of course, and indeed, water destroys the UV reactiveness of chlorophyll. A shame, because I would love to create an edible colour pigment with it without butter/oil, so you can colour a bunch of food. I have done a bunch of experiments but haven't found a solution to it as of now. Where does your fascination for glow food come from?\njagedlion: I started making glowing test-tube shooters in college.  Classic vodka-tonic with a little artificial flavoring and sometimes coloring.  But I didn't go back to it until more recently.  My wife had a friend who was graduating with her PhD in philosophy of science, so I thought it would be fun to have a science themed meal.  I figure I do enough microscopy I should be able to enhance my old gamut.\n\nWe made some tonic from cinchona bark (which came out _ok_ but I wouldn't recommend it) and I then made a range of colored drinks.  The blue and green were easy, but for red I just made the mint extract, and then mixed it into mojitos for guests.  Makes a GREAT drink mixed because it tastes like you just freshly muddled the mint into the drink.  And it's still fun to see someone add a glowing ingredient to the drink even if it doesn't stay glowing.\nPhotoandGrime: Sounds cool :)! I made UV reactive edible oil with chlorophyll once; specifically chlorella supplements. You can use spirulina as well, but personally I really dislike the smell and taste of spirulina so I used chlorella. I used it as edible face paint, in recipes (pink/red buttercream), but also in a drink (http://i.imgur.com/dHyuyfR.gifv). I put a little bit of it in milk, and since it's an oil, it floats. Because milk has a lot of fat in it, the colour doesn't dissolve. And actually, it's not bad at all to drink (especially if you sweeten the milk or make a mix drink). Sure, you get a bit of an oily taste, but it's not like you're drinking a whole glass of oil hehe. It's nice to 'meet' a fellow glow food appreciator haha! You know what I really find annoying about all UV reactive ingredients? They are either pretty bitter or a pain in the ass to extract (chlorophyll). You'd think with their glow effect in ultraviolet light, they would be sweet as well, but vitamin B2, Quinine and turmeric all don't taste too well without being mixed with other (sweet) ingredients. ;P\n", "prompt": "PhotoandGrime: Edible UV glow lightsaber\n\njagedlion: Use a little bit of vitamin B2: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F7URNTE\n\nYou can make a bright yellow green one.

I suppose that torque calculations won't be straightforward given the complexity of the human body.\nThey_call_me_Doctor: There are some good books on the subject. I think one is Human biomechanics or smth like that. You can google it. Its not easy at all but its a good reference point. I mean, when I did it few years back i found that local amount of muscle mass(eg upper arm or calf) can throw off the result significantly yet there is no accurate way to measure everything precisely.

An inch (or) more around calf(or thigh) can significantly change torque at lets say front lever. No one adds 20kg ankle weights but 1 or at most 2kg to planche or front lever and it makes it a lot harder. Or it can be more like general tendency for a person to carry a lot of (muscle) mass at the certain parts of the body making some exercises more or less challenging in addition to lever lengths or proportions. Two inches doesnt look like much around calf but it is significant volume. Same thing with waist width and thigh circumference. \nPJ_GRE: Interesting.

{"full_text": "Rob_Rogers: Poor Man's Bankruptcy\nWhat do you do if you get in way over your head in debt. Bankruptcy is one path but it is has a cost since you need to hire an attorney and go through the court process. That court process is intimidating and public. One viable approach is to simply walk away. Being broke is not criminal and both parties (bank and you) agree from the onset to accept the risks. I don't think people realize that when it comes to unsecured debts, you can just stop paying. Unsecured means a credit card or personal loan. Debts connected to auto or real property are secured debts. You can walk away from those, but you'll stand to lose the asset. You can walk away from unsecured debts, and keep everything. In order for a credit card company to try to recover monies, they need to secure a judgement against you. In order to secure a judgement, they need satisfy the requirements in the Fair Credit Reporting Act before I judge will hear it.\n\nI'm not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. I am sharing my personal experience.\n\nI found myself a new college grad with over 50k in credit card debts across multiple cards. At the time, my focus was on doing whatever I needed to do to finish school. This includes all credit spending, charges and cash advances. I used them to subsidize my cost of living over 6 years. I had a modest first job as a new graduate. I I rented but had roommates. The 100k student loans activated and were now due. Something had to give so I decided to walk away from the cards.\n\nThe immediate response was constant robo calls reminding me that I was past due sometimes until 10pm. I received mail daily that I was past due. I changed my mailing address to a PO Box and forwarded mail there. I started blocking numbers and turning my ringer off at night. After about 3-4 months I started to get 3rd party collections notices. I answered every single one of them in writing. I denied owing what they said I owed and replied with signature confirmation that they needed to provide me with a copy of the signed loan contract, calculation of all spending, my signed receipts of all spending, calculation of all interest payments, and their license to work as a collection agency in my state. Some would disappear after that. Others would send me incomplete information, so I could reiterate that I disputed the claim and needed complete information.\n\nNot a single collection agency provided all the information. I mean, how could they. It was a near impossible ask. Some would reply and say they were dropping the collection and returning it to the original creditor. I felt like I was starting to win.\n\nAll this occurred over a period of months. During that time, I got a new job and moved to a different state. In that state I established a new phone number and new PO Box. Every now and again I would get a collection call on my new number or new address, but it was minimal. I would again block the call or reply demanding they validate the claim. If I was feeling lazy, I wouldn't open the envelope, mark it RTS across the front (Return to Sender) and drop it back in the mailbox.\n\nAfter about a year, I would get charge off notifications. This means the credit card company is writing off the debt and is taking it as a loss. They would send me a tax document for it. The IRS had a process in which discharged debt income could be excluded from taxable income, but you had to fill out the right forms. Because of the huge student loans, I had a negative net wealth, so I qualified. I filled those out and never paid taxes on the discharged amounts.\n\nIn the second year, there was one collection agency that was particularly stubborn. They sent me some certified mail. A notification card sat in my PO Box and I never went to the counter to pick it up. They did that maybe 2-3 times and each it was not picked up and after a few days the post office automatically returned it to the sender. Pro tip: Never sign for unsolicited certified mail.\n\nAround year 3, I started pulling my free credit reports and would do so every year thereafter. I disputed any/all negative marks with the credit reporting agencies. For example, if Transunion removed something, I would send that report to the other two agencies and usually that would be enough for them to remove it on their reports as well. But it's a slow process with 2-3 months in between each response.\n\nAs time went by, I never went to court, nothing was garnished, nobody seized anything, no process servers came to my door, nobody called me at work, no police came to my door.  I always paid the student loan and rent, never missed a payment on either of those. Always filed and paid my taxes. After six years, I was satisfied that the statute of limitations for collecting on unsecured debts had sunset (varies by state). I went to my brick and mortar that I had been banking with the whole time (debit card only) and got a credit card with a $500 limit and started to build up a positive history. Two years later I bought a house with a traditional mortgage.\n\nNote: That the credit reports were questioned by new employers from time to time. I said the debts were related to medical bills and medical condition. That stops them from questioning further as medical is protected and I never lost a job offer due to bad credit.\nnesowat: Disgusting lack of ethics.

My cousin went from being a pious Catholic to a pot hot head hipster over the time she knew her ex-husband. The worst part is how she brought great shame to her father.

{"full_text": "Botunda: I wished that I realized that I mattered more in life. What are you figuring out 'just now'?\n\npoiklpu: I just saw the secretariat and while not the greatest movie by any means, it made me think about something. (spoilers ahead) the lead character, a housewife, takes control over her father's horses because he has Alzheimer's and his wife just died. The father then dies and she's given control of the horses, and her brother control of the estate. The estate will need 6 million to continue to run and by now Secretariat could be worth 7 million. She is eventually is offered 8 mill but ultimately declines, and this is important. She declines because she believes the horse can win the triple crown (a feat not accomplished in decades) and the horse will be worth it by the end of it. Because this is a disney movie of course the horse ends up winning the three races, and winning the final race (longest of the three) by a margin of about 30 horses. I'm pretty sure his time and distance hasn't been beaten to this day which is kind of amazing actually. But onto the point of all this. \n\nIn the race right before the first triple crown race, Secretariat had a sore in his mouth and ended up taking third, and if this happened in any of the triple crown races it would have lessened the horses value after the fact. And that made me think. If Secretariat happened to lose some or all of the triple crown races, the owner would have seemed crazy. Following the races, the brother and her husband would have said that they were right when they told her they shouldn't sold the horse. Also I'm sure in any future arguments with the husband and her, financial or otherwise, would have, more often than not, ended in the husbands favor. Probably with the underlying notion that \"the wife makes bad decisions, gets caught up in fanciful, sensationalized ideas, and is a bit crazy, and the husband thinks rationally and makes the decision that's 'right.\" I'd also go as far as to say that most everyone would have looked down on her because she put her family in debt with the risk she took. History would have forgotten her as a woman who literally bet the farm and lost, but instead she goes down as the woman who fostered the greatest racehorse ever.\n\nSo history would have looked at her as crazy for the rest of her life or a genius based on how one decision panned out. One decision. This racehorse could have been training one day and a blade of grass could have been floating in the wind, or a bug could have been flying along the track and either of them could have gotten into his eye, caused the beginning of an infection and made the racehorse unfit to race until after the last race. She would then be considered crazy for sending her family into debt and trying to win a race no one had won in 20 some odd years. It made me realize that depending on how much risk someone takes, we can deem someone incredibly wise or ridiculously foolish by the **outcome** of a decision. Not by the decision itself, but by how it pans out. It seems a bit insane to me that we as a society can look at two different women who make the same exact decisions, who take the same risk, but call one an incredible dreamer, and one a sensationalist young woman, all depending on the position of a blade of grass? **tldr:**Maybe i'm overthinking a simple children's movie but if it's the people who make the big risks who drive innovation in our society, the people who put their life savings in to an idea they don't know will work, or mortgage their house to see if their hypothesis will hold true in an experiment that is costly, how can we as a society fault them if their idea doesn't pan out? \nChickenOfDoom: Because our society is obsessed with the idea that the individual has absolute control over his/her destiny. We can all make it big as long as we're just good enough to do it, and those who don't become one of the elite were just too lazy/stupid/unskilled.\n\nBasically, our class system is propped up by an illusionary meritocracy based on our collective denial of chance as a major factor in our lives.\n", "prompt": "Botunda: I wished that I realized that I mattered more in life.

It's been great, minus my lack of handy experience, but everyone has to start somewhere. \n\nWe had a lot of rain this week and as a result our ceiling sprung a [leek](http://imgur.com/nCSd0bq).  Today I decided to check it out before calling a professional.  The portion of the [roof](http://imgur.com/0Tc9gUd) that is leaking seems to be some sort of metal that is sealed (or is supposed to be).  It is on a dormer that was likely an addition at some point. The rest of the roof is shingled and looks to be in decent shape. \n\nThe problem appears to be the vents in the roof.  Here is:\n*[Vent 1](http://imgur.com/NaWBtS1)\n*[Vent 2](http://imgur.com/Vt7xqAH)\n\nIt is fairly apparent at this point where the water is coming into the house at. I picked away some of the material around Vent 1 and it looks something like this [underneath](http://imgur.com/RvdOKt0). \n\nIt seems that I need to scrape off as much of the weathered sealant as I can and replace the flashing around the vents.  Then reseal the entire dormer portion of the roof with a better product.  Am I right in this methodology or missing something?\n\nSomebody that has experienced this before: what products work best for sealing this type of roof? What about something like [this](http://flexsealproducts.com/shop/liquid/?gclid=CjwKEAjwpfC5BRCT1sKW2qzwqE0SJABkKFKR8vrBSPm1j268gQ3Ni2tXcIO6EmJD-F04Kx3Dj91bFhoC_vnw_wcB)?\nThe appearance in this location isn't very important, as it can't be seen from the ground.\n\nThanks a bunch!\nsomeonesdaddy: I laugh so hard at everyone in this thread that says call a roofer. I laugh even harder at the top comment that says call the previous homeowner and ask him to help pay for it. \n\nThese roof vents are known frequent culprits for leaking and it is no big deal. Clean the area up and apply a rubberized compound or tar. I have even used the rubberized aerosol spray before thus creating a rubber boot.\n\nI like the rubberized product called stop leak. It comes in a one gallon paint can and you apply/shape it with a putty knife. For a complex shape I will wear rubber gloves and mold it by hand. \n\nYou are a homeowner now and welcome to the big leagues.  You can't call someone everytime your toilet is clogged anymore. Go forth and be the master of your castle.\n\nYour average contractor will scare you into turning a small job into a big one. This is especially true if they think the homeowner is not very mechanically savvy. \nAbsolutelyPink: While I agree that a roofing contractor can scare you into turning a small job into a big one, this roof is in bad shape and flat or semi-flat roofing jobs are best left to a professional.  Spraying rubber isn't going to fix this one. \n\nI have roofing experience, but there are specialty products meant for flat roofs that aren't as simply as spraying rubber on the roof. It need to be redone and not just around the vents.\n\nMake sure you call a couple companies for estimates and make sure they specialize in flat roofs.  You can check with mobile home sellers in your area for referrals as well.\n\nYou will also need to fix that drywall.  Odds are, the insulation (if any) above that is wet as well.  The drywall will need replacing at a minimum.  If it's still wet, poke a couple holes in it to let the water drain.\n\nAs a temporary measure, tarp your roof until you get it repaired.\nsomeonesdaddy: I agree with you and your advice is sound. There have been times in my life when I could not afford the proper solution or the best one.\n\nI have made due with patching stuff like this in the past. In Florida where I live the roofing laws are funny because of hurricanes. If anything more than 25% of the roof is damaged you are required to get a whole new roof. \n\nI have seen plenty of good roofs complete torn off because a small section needed repair. These days homeowners are looking for a roofer  that is not going to pull a permit thus requiring inspection. \nAbsolutelyPink: I agree.  I've been in the position where I couldn't afford to have things done properly and made due with what I could afford.  It sucks.  Unfortunately, a roof is not where you want to pinch pennies. Heck, in Nevada we get winds enough to rip off a roof. This roof will leak and leak again until it's redone.  Let's just hope there hasn't been enough damage already, to cause the ceiling or roof to cave in though mold might already be of issue.\nBrotisBoughtAHouse: Thanks for the feedback.  I think I might be able to handle the flashing parts, but as others have pointed out, there are likely greater underlying problems that I don't want to risk.  It's looking like stop leak is the way to go for now for an immediate solution.  Over the next week I plan to get a slew of estimates on a more thorough fix.

Charred pieces of his body were dragged through town, and his fingers and fingernails were taken as keepsakes.\n\nPublic spectacle lynchings were most frequent in the South, but also occurred in Northern and Midwestern states as black Americans migrated during the 20th century. In 1920, 10,000 whites attended the lynchings of three black circus workers in Duluth, Minnesota. \n\nIn Springfield, Missouri, in 1906, two black men, Horace Dunn and Fred Coker, were hanged and shot to death for a crowd of 5000 whites.

If you die on 8-4 it will start you on 8-1. Still cool though.\nTheKunit: Seems like Nintendo intentionally made the switch version include something like this. I can't imagine it was accidental. When you load your profile it only takes you to the last caslte you beat. Meaning if you beat 5 levels and got to all castle but can't beat it, you go back to the previous castle when you load the game. It's meant a lot of redoing levels and it went from the wii version being my families favorite game to the switch version not being used at all.\nfatphotog: The switch nes app has save states, you can literally save at any moment no matter where you are. You start exactly at that moment when you go back. Are you not using the save state function?\nTheKunit: It's not super Mario Brothers nes it's super Mario Brothers deluxe for the switch.\n\nAlso how do I get the nes version? I have only had my switch for a short time. Didn't even know you could get old games like that.\nfatphotog: Oh you mean new super Mario bro\u2019s delux, my bad. You can still quick save where you are on the map in that game. I forget the exact process but I think you just pause and choose quick save. It will make you quit back to the menu but will have a little balloon next to your save file meaning it\u2019s been quick saved and you\u2019ll start right from the point of the map where you quick saved. The original nes version is part of the online subscription that you can pay for. It allows you to have online access in supported games and also comes with a nes channel and a SNES channel. They each have many games from each console you can play anytime as long as you are subbed to Nintendo online. I think it\u2019s like $3 dollars a month or something.\nTheKunit: Unfortunately the quick save function either only works once or has some other odd requirement that it does not tell you about. At this point I've done the beginning of the game up to the second works at least 3 or 4 times and so far it's still forcing me to restart from the world 1 castle. I quick wave every time. Doing some research you are supposed to go back and beat an easy castle so it fully saves the game. I don't know why a basic save function is so difficult for Nintendo to figure out but it's infuriating. Super Mario party is the same way. You can't save in the game at all. If you quit during a game it's gone for good.\nfatphotog: When you\u2019re done playing, if you have gone a couple levels since the last castle or mushroom house, just quick save..Next time you want to play you start where you quick saved.\nTheKunit: OK but I've done that. If you have to play multiple sessions between castles it won't save more than the one time.\nfatphotog: I don\u2019t understand, just quick save again?\n\n*edit  Do you mean once you restart from a quick save you lose all your lives before beating a castle or finding a mushroom house? Yes if you lose all your lives after starting from a quick save, you will start at your last *real* save point. It\u2019s very, very difficult in this game to actually lose all your lives imo.\nTheKunit: https://www.gamepur.com/guides/nsmbu-deluxe-how-to-save\n\nThis is a good descriptor of the issue\nfatphotog: Right, and that article clearly states that if you don\u2019t quick save again, which is all you\u2019ll have to do, you go back to your last \u201creal\u201d save. Which is exactly what I said.\nTheKunit: Basically if you turn off the switch or put in another game the quick save function doesn't work\nfatphotog: Yes, so don\u2019t do that? The article is literally saying exactly what I\u2019m saying. This is how the very short article ends: \u201cOnce you reload the save file where the Quick Save occurred, you\u2019ll need to keep quick saving to keep your progress indefinitely before you reach an actual save point.\n\nIf you turn the system off or close the game without Quick Sav, you\u2019ll be sent back to the previous actual save you did\u2014which means you could lose tons of progress that you made through difficult levels.\u201d\nTheKunit: Dude I'm telling you it's not without quick saving like you are trying to make out. You seem hell bent on proving that an internet stranger doesn't understand how to save a freaking video game though so idk what to tell you. It's not like I've been playing video games for my entire life and know how to do basic shit like saving, pressing the menu button, or jumping.\n\nI also need help getting my undies on after my nurse assisted shower.\n\nGood riddance\nfatphotog: Holy shit bro, I\u2019m not being rude at all. I\u2019m just answering your questions. The article you posted says literally the exact same thing that I am saying. Just don\u2019t turn the game off or put in another game without quick saving first. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know what else to say. I mean it\u2019s not hard at all to understand, so now I am going to be condescending, because you are clearly stupid.

{"full_text": "zykal: Insulating a room that has  exterior hollow cinder walls 1950's construction\nI live in a house built in the 1950's in phx AZ I have 2 rooms that the south facing wall and a west and East facing wall in the respective rooms are bare Hollow cinder. I was looking for a way to fix this as in the summer the wall gets to 100+. I was thinking of Using a type of foam board but what would be the best way to go about it? \n\nI mean the simplist way would be foam board + liquid nails but I think there are better alternatives. Do I want to keep a gap between the wall and the foam?  Also what type of foamboard do you think will be best. \n\nIs there a better way? \n\nEDIT - Also as far as finishing it sheetrock wise do I need to do anything special or can i just attach it to the foamboard? Assuming foamboard is best option.\n\nThanks DIY\n\nEDIT 2 - this is a tempt housing situation - 2-3 years maybe, So do not want to invest alot into it so outside work is more then likely out. As far as having the cinders filled, my neighbor had that done and its a waste of money. Here in AZ once summer hits it doesn't drop below 100 even just before the sun rises (coolest part of the night) for months on end. There is still enough mass in the cinder that is not insulated to have the same 100+ walls on the inside.\n\nEdit 3 - So the Foamboard Will give me the best R value per inch?  Thanks for the link for this old house. Thats basically what I was looking at doing as far as the foamboard goes. Then I can just add the wood strips and pull the electrical out another 3 or so inches and add the sheetrock. Do they make insulative sheet rock?\n\nTrying to get as much out of it as I can I really would like to stay 4 or less inches on each wall but If I need to do more I need to do more I guess. \n\n\nshuffler: Commercial insulation contractor here (not residential, but I hope I help), you have a variety of options:\n\n* if you do not want to do anything to the inside or outside, have an injection foam contractor come in and pump your cinder blocks full of insulating foam. \n\n* if you don't mind going on the outside of the house, I agree with SgianDubh in that you should put a radiant barrier on the outside of the house and then some sort of insulation on the inside of the house (foam in the blocks or fur out the interior). the radiant on the outside will reflect a good chunk (the 97% they claim is garbage) of the radiant energy hitting your south and west walls for heat gain, but doesn't help against the cold.\n\n* if you are furring out the inside, extruded polystyrene foam insulation will give you the most r-value per inch. It is my understanding that you can put the foam board directly against the block wall, tape the seams, foam the cracks at the bottom and top of the wall and it can be considered your vapor barrier. [You can see this done in a basement here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jSuWbdJy5A). For better or worse, I'm a believer in what Mike Holmes does.  The foam board will get you R-5 per inch where the fiberglass and cellulose is R-3. Keep in mind that the foam board will cost you much more than just glass or cellulose, but I think that it may work better for you. Once you have the board up and taped you can build your stud wall and insulate with fiberglass if you want. I would skip the vapor barrier with the stud wall. The trick of this is, like CvilleTallMan said, assuming that these walls are above grade and that you live in phoenix, moisture is not such an issue like it is here in the northern plains. You can probably just use a 6-mil poly over the studs with fiberglass you put in yourself or sprayed in cellulose by a contractor.  I'm just always worried that cellulose will settle. I have seen it happen too many times for it to be just a random occurrence. \n\n* do NOT glue your drywall to the block or foam board. Take the time to fur out a wall and run your outlets, etc.. You will thank me later.\nBowzer84: Expanded foam was my first thought too. seems like it would be relatively easy to pour/inject it right down into the cinder blocks.\nwickedpissa: you'll still have a crazy amount of thermal bridging reducing the insulating factors greatly.\nrcrracer: Test have proven your statement is correct.\n", "prompt": "zykal: Insulating a room that has  exterior hollow cinder walls 1950's construction\nI live in a house built in the 1950's in phx AZ I have 2 rooms that the south facing wall and a west and East facing wall in the respective rooms are bare", "orig": "Hollow cinder.

{"full_text": "[deleted]: If an online friend frequently apologizes for slow replies over text, what does this imply?\n[deleted]\nPonytail77: I think it implies that the apology really isn't that sincere.  If you are truly sorry you try not to repeat it again.   \n\nThis friend is aware she's ignored your texts and so is trying to be polite by opening her reply repeatedly with a \"I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but...\"  \n\nIt basically shows they're busy and/or have other priorities.\n[deleted]: What she wrote was, \"Hey! Sorry for not answering for a long time - I was on vacation outside the city and there was no connection.\" She was honest about it because I saw from her stories, though when she replied it was like nine days past the New Year and I texted her on NYE. With that being said, my texts have always been very long so whether or not she was sincere it probably didn't matter that much. There's been a general trend of her replying once every week. But I've also noticed that when I wrote something that she didn't felt comfortable answering, for example I asked her if she liked to watch any Halloween movies over Halloween, then she took a longer time to reply and then came back at the end of November and apologized for being very busy (but only after I accidentally liked one of her IG photos which probably sent a notification to her phone). It's true that she was busy with something but no one could have probably been that busy that they would take a long time to reply to a text.\n\nBtw I also confronted her about this and it got really messy. But I get the sense that she wants to send meaningful replies rather than just \"one or two word texts,\" as she put it. So she may not have been sincere with the apology but she is probably sincere with the conversation. But also a part of me can't help but wonder if she feels pressured to apologize for slow replies after I nearly set an ultimatum on the conversation. I mean she's apologized in the past before for slow replies but I get the sense that she is probably going to apologize more often now out of any lingering pressure that she feels from me. I tried my best to move on from the confrontation but when something like that happens it's hard to forget. Now she's been busier with her life than before but yeah, I keep looking at it from my perspective and it's hard to come to terms with it. Like what if this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly..\nPonytail77: \"...this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly\"\n\nFrom what you've said, I think this is the most likely answer. Rather than \"read between the lines\" as they say, she just takes her time in responding -politely of course- hoping you'll get the hint.\n[deleted]: But couldn't that have also been because my texts were very long? Maybe if my texts had been shorter she wouldn't have apologized?\n\nHere's a brief timeline of the texts: She replied on October 23. I replied on November 6. She replied on November 28. I replied on December 24. She replied on December 28. I replied on December 31. She replied on January 9. She started off her replies on November 28 and January 9 with apologies. I have not replied since. I have backed off by a lot already. Is it not enough??\nPonytail77: I would take a break until I heard from her.  Or at least another month or so. \n\nSounds like you want more from this friendship then she is willing or able to give right now.  If she's interested, she can reach out to you at any time too.\n[deleted]: That's what I was thinking too. Not just because she told me that she's starting a new job but also because I am not completely sure if I should open up more in my texts with her. What draws me to her is that she is able to answer in detail, with compassion, and with great energy. It's not like she answers in one to three sentences. Often she answers in five to ten sentences. It's clear that she puts effort into her messages even if her priorities have changed or whatnot, and as a result, I overshare with her sometimes.\n\nBut I am still unsure how much I actually matter to her. Any confrontation that involved making excessive demands would turn people off. Whether or not it's long term remains to be seen. She said she's not mad, and she said she still likes the communication. I believe her, but people can also subtly pull themselves away while still being very polite. Not to mention she lives in a foreign country where the main language isn't English. Of course she has an incentive to communicate in English.\n\nIf I still matter to her in some way or the other, then she'll eventually reach out like she did before. I hate to say this but this is my way of testing her. I hope to take a break and not reply to her until May and continue to do nothing (not watching her stories, not liking any of her posts). If she doesn't reach out again asking how I am doing before then like she used to that should say something about how she actually feels.\nDiabetaBun: \u201cI hope to take a break\u201d I think, is a good start. Not as far as testing her but for your own self. Whether she is being too kind to upkeep her conversation with you, or simply too busy, or find it hard to respond due to language limitations, whatever else the \u201cpossible\u201d explanation could be, it\u2019s always important to refrain from being emotionally codependent with or on another. Coming from a neutral standpoint, you can still have meaningful conversations with her and very much have an \u2018active\u2019 relationship while not expecting too much from it. It is pretty apparent that, at this current time, she is unable to meet your needs. That is okay. There is so much that we can do when it involves another but we do have control on how we choose to handle the situation. I suggest being open to others who can click with you and meet your needs. It won\u2019t minimize the respect you have for your friend and it will increase the respect you have for yourself.\n\nIn regards to the frequent apologies, it\u2019s kind of hard to say. It can be due to insecurities, or fear to disappoint, or it can be because she doesn\u2019t like late responses herself, or, on top of fear to disappoint, she just simply has an active life and she does feel bad to have anyone waiting on her because she believes on being that great friend. If that makes sense\u2026\n[deleted]: There's something else that she mentions more frequently than apologies, and that's starting almost every single text with a \"Hey!\" This is something that she has started doing ever since last October, right around the time when my overbearing attitude went to extremes. Maybe she just happened to pick up something new, but I wonder if using hey consistently is a good thing? I know starting a text with a \"hey\" is great because it's informal, but she's using this on every single text now. Could she be using this to maintain distance?\nDiabetaBun: 1.) Out if curiosity, how long have the two of you known each other? \n\n2.) We\u2019re splitting hairs at this point.\n\n3.) Social Media has downside effects on how people perceive what is appropriate in aspects that involve communication and interpersonal relationships. For example, it becomes an expectation/demand to receive a response. To expound further, if the sender of the text sees that the receiver has indeed seen the text but have not yet responded, it rises the senders anxiety levels which in turn may cause them to over think or over analyze. \n\nI\u2019m not saying anything negative so I hope you don\u2019t take it as such but rather consider this information and do something proactive about your perception on things in regards to sending and receiving texts or what the messages contain. Don\u2019t stress too much about it.\n\nIt seems you really enjoy her company and value her insights and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to distance ourselves from something we see as value. At this point, if it were me in your shoes, I would apologize for the demands I have made because it sets up unrealistic expectations for them and puts some sort of stress on the relationship whether it is big or small. From what you have shared thus far, it\u2019s very minor. So it\u2019s nothing really to worry about. Then I would proceed to share what I value in this relationship and set expectations or guidelines that I know I can live by (nothing on them to do but for myself to do). When that gets done, I would take a step back and just not expect anything else other than what has already been given to be expected. The sooner we can come to accept things for what they are, the sooner we can address the \u201cissue\u201d at hand and move on from it. \n\nJust a precaution, this is advice given by someone who is big on communication and being quite frank and upfront. I don\u2019t like \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d and walking around the bushes. It\u2019s just something I face everyday with people and found it necessary for me to be proactive in eliminating bs.

{"full_text": "Kavec: What if PETA was wrong and its consequences.\nI am talking about the typical discussion: why People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) do not want people to harm animals but they are OK with eating plants.\n\nThe answers about that are akin to \"duh! killing a plant is not the same thing as killing an animal!\", but they kind of avoid the interesting points:\nhttp://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/why-is-it-ok-to-eat-plants-and-not-animals/\n\nNevertheless this article hits the nail on the head when it enunciates the subject of the discussion:\n\n&gt; But what if we don\u2019t know enough about plants? It\u2019s easy to understand why this discussion could lead someone who enjoys eating meat and other animal products to conclude that we might as well eat animals, since not eating them could lead us down a ridiculous slippery slope where we might not be able to eat anything. Such a conclusion, unfortunately amounts to nothing more than an excuse to justify our consumption of animals. \n\nMy guess on the matter is a little bit difficult for me to explain but I'll do my best (specially not being English my mothertongue, not at all):\n\nLots of people are able to stare at a dead fish and feel nothing, but when they see a dead dog and they feel realy bad. I think this happens because for an average human it is easier to relate to a mammal than to a fish, both being ~~human~~ living beings. What if we go farther away from the mammals. What if we talk about plants: we feel a little bit bad if a big tree is cut down, because some of us can relate to that as we are both of us human beings. But I think most of us agree that this reaction is, in average, a lot less stressful than someone cutting a dog in front of us.\n\nWe can observe in life that dying is most likely an stressful experience for all living beings, in some way or another. Keeping that in mind, let's go even farther: bacteria, body cells, etc. One might presume that they fight against death as furiously as a person who is drowning and is fighting for some air. Does it mean that antibiotics are unethical?\n\nFor me the solution to this puzzle is to change the formulation of \"Ethical Treatment\" (as in PETA) which is usually understood as \"avoiding pain\" to other living beings. IMO, what we really want to avoid is **our own pain**. Thus if you allow other humans to get hurt, you feel you will be likely to get hurt as well. Same thing goes with animals: if you allow people to hurt animals which we relate to, it is easy that these people get insensible also to human suffering. With plants this risk is very little, this is why PETA would not care about people eating vegies.\n\nDoes it make sense? Any ideas on the matter?\n\n---\n\n**Edit**: I agree with the general argument that \"plants have no nervous system\", but I still would not be sure that this means that they have no feelings. I would like to add some relevant information to this discussion:\n\nVery relevant: TED Talk, The roots of plant intelligence http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/stefano_mancuso_the_roots_of_plant_intelligence.html\n\nAskscience: Are bugs able to feel pain? http://ww.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ib81m/are_bugs_able_to_feel_pain/\n\n**Edit2**: I am not saying that it is OK to be cruel to animals. Not in the least. I am just wondering if the typical moral arguments that support it are flawed, and discussing some alternatives.\n\nIn the ancient times, people would not consider a tree as a living being. Now we do. Some centuries ago almost no one would believe that animals had feelings. Now we do. Our understanding and perception about the matter varies over the time.\nbobbaphet: The consequences would be irrelevant, even if plants had feelings. The reason why is because it would be completely unreasonable to not eat plants. The typical moral argument is not flawed even if plants did have feeling because the only other alternative would be to starve yourself to death, *which is completely and totally unreasonable*. Only an insane person would think otherwise. Whether or not plants have feelings is irrelevant.\njohnbentley: &gt; even if plants did have feeling because the only other alternative would be to starve yourself to death, which is completely and totally unreasonable.\n\nWhat if the plants where not only conscious but self conscious?\nbobbaphet: So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\njohnbentley: Yes.\n\nIf you develop a condition where you need a heat transplant, and none are available from the organ donor list, it would be immoral to kill another (adult) human so that you might live. The wrongness doesn't lie in species membership, it lies in that other (adult) humans are self conscious.\nbobbaphet: &gt;Yes.\n\nwhich is completely and totally unreasonable. Only an insane person would think otherwise.\n\njohnbentley: But you don't address the heart transplant case.\nbobbaphet: Yes, I usually don't address irrelevant things.\njohnbentley: Why is it not relevant?\nbobbaphet: Because regardless of what is true, not eating plants is not an option, unless you are insane and suicidal...\njohnbentley: That is possibly the most intellectually dishonest response I've come across.\nbobbaphet: \"Yes you should not eat plants if they are conscious\", is what the most intellectually dishonest response is. That is totally ludicrous!\njohnbentley: I never made that claim, and that you are back there demonstrates your intellectual dishonesty.\nbobbaphet: Yes you did. \n\nI said: \"So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\" \n\nYour response was: \"Yes\". \n\nYou are the one being intellectually dishonest here. Or perhaps you just forgot you said that? \n\n\n\njohnbentley: I forgot nothing. Your recent reference \"if they are conscious\", not \"if they were self conscious\".\n\n\n\n\nbobbaphet: So if they are conscious OR self conscious, we should starve ourselves to death?...Nonsense either way.\njohnbentley: That this is not my view is further evidence of your intellectual laziness.\nbobbaphet: If that is the case, then you should have not said \"Yes\" to the question...\njohnbentley: I answered \"Yes\" to\n\n&gt; So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\n\nI didn't answer yes to \n\n&gt; if they are conscious OR self conscious, we should starve ourselves to death?\n\nI'd like to know what criteria you have for judging it morally permissible to take or save a life. If it species membership then we have nothing left to discuss.\nbobbaphet: &gt;I answered \"Yes\" to So if they were self conscious, then we should starve ourselves to death?...\n\nExactly, which is completely and totally ridiculous...\n.\njohnbentley: It may well be ridiculous but the intellectually honest course is to say why. One way to say why is to show why some other criteria is the right, and vastly superior, one.\nbobbaphet: &gt;It may well be ridiculous but the intellectually honest course is to say why.\n\nBecause you are advocating **committing suicide**..**.Which is insane**... I thought that part was obvious...but I guess not... Get back to me when you want to have a **reasonable** discussion...\njohnbentley: But I addressed the argument from committing suicide (in the sense of letting yourself die rather than kill others) in the heart transplant case. You ignored it. You seem to be a bigot, having entrenched ideas that you shy away from examining.\nbobbaphet: I ignored it because it's irrelevant because committing suicide is literally insane... Like I said, I am only interested in reasonable discussions. You are simply being unreasonable. \njohnbentley: So you think a healthy person should be killed so their organs should be distributed to save the lives of others (who will die without the new organs) so they don't have to commit suicide (the sense in which you are using \"commit suicide\")?\n\nIf that is your position it is unorthodox and immoral.\nbobbaphet: Nope, no one should be killed to save another, unless you are talking about committing suicide because you don't want to kill plants...talk about unreasonable...\njohnbentley: &gt; Nope, no one should be killed to save another.\n\nRight, then why would it be right to kill a plant, who counts as one if they are self conscious, to save the lives of others?\n\nIf they don't count as one in virtue of self consciousness what criteria do you use before a being counts as deserving the right to life?\nbobbaphet: I already answered that but you just can't understand it...\njohnbentley: Point to your answer.\nbobbaphet: &gt;because committing suicide is literally insane...\njohnbentley: But you are happy for those who have faulty organs to commit suicide rather than kill another for their healthy organs.\n\nYou believe your own position to be insane.\nbobbaphet: That is quite literally the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard...\njohnbentley: That's question begging.\nbobbaphet: No it isn't. It's my opinion of your statements...\njohnbentley: The question is (at least one form of it) \"Why is self consciousness as a criteria for the saving or taking of life wrong?\"\n\nJust asserting that self consciousness is the wrong criteria (by calling it \"insane\") is not anywhere near an attempt to explain why. That is what makes it question begging. \n\nAny attempts by me to have you get at the details end up with you studiously avoiding those details. It is as if you but your fingers in your ears and just shout: \"It's insane, it's insane\". \n\nI illustrate why no one can seriously hold the view in some cases letting your self die ('committing suicide' as you characterise it, a plausible characterisation) rather than take the life of another is morally good. But you persist with \"committing suicide is literally insane\".\nbobbaphet: You're insane. Seek professional help.\njohnbentley: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem\nbobbaphet: If you actually knew what Ad hominem was, you wouldn't be saying that. Ad hominem can only occur in the context of an argument. I was not making an argument, I was just telling you you should seek professional help because you're insane. \njohnbentley: Your response to my argument is to characterise it as so wrong to be evidence of insanity. Your response is paradigmatic ad hominem. Whether I'm insane or not has no bearing on the truth of my claims or the validity of my argument.\nbobbaphet: I don't care about your argument. I'm just saying you're insane. :)\njohnbentley: Then it's a plain old non sequitur.\nbobbaphet: So what?\njohnbentley: It is irrelevant.\nbobbaphet: Yes, your arguments are irrelevant, I agree.\njohnbentley: No your claim of insanity is.\nbobbaphet: No it isn't.\njohnbentley: Yes, this is the meaning of a non sequitur. The conclusion in no way follows from the premises. \nbobbaphet: Is this an actual person talking? or some alien robot computer?\njohnbentley: That still doesn't address the issue. Your intellectual dishonesty is complete. Your next move is to try and claim to be a troll, to make it seem that you really could explain your sincere views if you wanted to.\nbobbaphet: It's wrong to not eat plants because not doing so would kill yourself. What part about that can you not understand? It's quite simple, a 5th grader could understand it. Holy god man...\njohnbentley: But it is not always wrong to kill yourself. The organ case shows that. In the organ case why is it not wrong to kill yourself?\nbobbaphet: Completely false. Dying from a failed organ is not the same as killing yourself. It's dying from a failed organ...\njohnbentley: At last! Some progress!\n\nYou can differentiate \"killing yourself\" or \"commit suicide\" from letting yourself die. If by \"committing suicide\" or \"killing yourself\" you mean taking active steps to end your life then this (edit: is) plausibly different from letting yourself die by failing to act. This second kind of death we could call \"death by omission\".\n\nDying from a failed organ is death by omission, you don't kill another human and you therefore die. So too in the plant case, you don't kill a plant and therefore you die.\n\nBoth cases are death by omission.\n\n\nbobbaphet: You can twist it around however you see fit, your statements are still totally ridiculous. Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: Why would one case by death by omission and not the other?\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\n\nCommon sense: \"sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts.\", \"\"the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way\"\n\nSomething that you are lacking.\njohnbentley: If both cases aren't death by omission (you've been good in allowing the assumption that there are no alternatives to a plant sourced diet) it should be very easy for you to say why, using common sense or whatever you like.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: Repeating that phrase just reveals your unwillingness to address the point made. A point made clearly and plainly. \n\nIt could be because you start to feel the weakness of your own position but I think it more likely that you are unused to the most basic level of intellectual enquiry.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\njohnbentley: So if you are very young, you don't have to wait for your faculties to mature to start exercising basic thinking and arguing skills. You could join a local book reading club, for example, in order to become used to addressing and discussing issues. \n\nAt the moment you are incapable of disagreement. That capability ought be your first goal.\nbobbaphet: Get back to me when you have some common sense.\n", "prompt": "Kavec: What if PETA was wrong and its consequences.\nI am talking about the typical discussion: why People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) do not want people to harm animals but they are OK with eating plants.\n\nThe answers about that are akin to \"duh! killing a plant is", "orig": "not the same thing as killing an animal!\", but they kind of avoid the interesting points:\nhttp://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/why-is-it-ok-to-eat-plants-and-not-animals/\n\nNevertheless this article hits the nail on the head when it enunciates the subject of the discussion:\n\n&gt;", "generated": "Kavec: What if PETA was wrong and its consequences.

{"full_text": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello! I am trying to install a water softener in our basement, in the utility room next to our water heater. I have a couple of questions before cutting into the plumbing. I created a diagram and included a picture below. You can access the diagram here and make edits if you'd like to help me confirm plumbing layout. [https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/3335eea1-83f3-405f-be58-b6f7563cd66b](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/3335eea1-83f3-405f-be58-b6f7563cd66b)\n\nMy questions are-\n\n1. There are a couple of branches off the main water line to our bathroom and kitchen before it reaches the water heater/utility room. I've read you want to install the softener right next to the main entry point for the water. This is not possible in my house so what is the next best thing?  \n2. I would want to leave our drinking water and outside spigots off the softener, so those would have to be looped out?\n3. Is it ok to just install the softener before the heater and not soften the cold water going to our bathroom/kitchen? or would it be stupid to do that and should I just soften the whole house?\n4. What is the ideal way to plumb to this softener based on the diagram below? Maybe I am just overcomplicating this.\n\nI feel good about doing the actual work, I would really like to confirm i am doing it the right way before i go through with it though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r8cp95lmxq41.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c553b8a676c855b82224eefb2905259b0a87ef1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idqc02ajmxq41.jpg?width=1724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec264596d6cd6c8feb6e6bdb6c9fac134d18805e\nTobyChan: I\u2019m in the UK so take what I say with a pinch of salt (did you see what I did there?)\n\nOver here it\u2019s normal to soften the water for the whole house expect you must leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap.  I would also leave any outdoor taps unsoftened so that you can water plants with untreated water.\nGrimResistance: &gt; leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap\n\nWhy is this?\nTobyChan: So you\u2019re not drinking and cooking with salty water\njohnwayne2413: Soft water is perfectly okay to drink.  I ran the numbers.\n\nTypically, water softeners add 46 mg/ liter of sodium for every 100 mg/liter of hardness minerals present in the water.\n\nThe grain per gallon (gpg) is a unit of water hardness defined as 1 grain (64.8 milligrams) of calcium carbonate dissolved in 1 US gallon of water (3.785412 L)\n\nThat works out to 17.11834802 mg calcium carbonate per liter of water.\n\nMy water is 18 grains hardness (which is very hard) so:\n\n    18 * 17.11834802 mg = 308.1302644 mg\n\nThe softener will add 141.7399216 mg sodium to 1 Liter of water (\\~34 ounces).\n\n    46 mg/L Na / 100 mg/L CaCO\u2083 = x / 308.1302644 mg CaCO\u2083\n    100x = 14,173.99 mg/L Na\n    x = 141.7399216 mg/L Na\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day\u2014that's equal to about 1 teaspoon of table salt!\n\nThis is how much water you would have to drink per day to exceed your salt intake:\n\n    (2,300 mg / 141.7399216 mg) * 34 ounces = 551 ounces of water per day\n\nIf you drank that much water in a day, ironically, you would die from hyponatremia (dilution of sodium in your blood) before you died from hypertension.\n\nTest your water hardness with a proper kit, the dropper kind, not the strips.  If your water is less hard than 18 grains then your safety margin is even higher.\n\nMost people should worry about eating potato chips or french fries adding too much salt to their body than drinking softened water.\nTobyChan: Again\u2026 read my caveat, I\u2019m from the UK and we have a limit on the sodium content on potable water supply.  Also, you have to appreciate that hardness is a relative term.  I\u2019ve seen borehole supplies that have been softened to the limit which still remain very hard.  If an untreated supply to the kitchen was added they could have softened the water further and actually got some benefit from the treatment!\n", "prompt": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello!

You have something, therefore you owe me! \nZellNorth: Do you think it\u2019s ok 26 people have more money than 3 billion people combined?\nLiberty_Call: Do you think it is ok to make decisions like this based on headlines without looking into what those people did to create that wealth and how the money is tied up?\n\nIf people were not allowed to be worth a whole lot we would not have things like Amazon, Microsoft, SpaceX or Apple. \n\nDo you think it is ok to dismantle these companies just to pay these ridiculous demands from people that obviously don't understand what they are demanding?\nZellNorth: No you didn\u2019t. You asked me followup questions without answering mine. \nLiberty_Call: Ok. Then let me be more clear.\n\nYour question is too vague and loaded to be answered without the extra information  I asked for. This is a complex situation, not voting for American idol.\n\nSo do you care to answer the questions? \nZellNorth: No. I do not. I don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s that difficult of a question to answer and don\u2019t see the relevance your questions. You\u2019re asking questions to change the topic to something that\u2019s more in line with whatever opinion you hold. \nLiberty_Call: So don't act like you want to have a conversation if all you want to do is spout catch phases and headlines.\n\nPromoting ignorance is never a positive way to use your life.\n\nThese questions matter because stoking those richest people from being rich would require them liquidating their assets which means selling off the huge amount of stock their own in their respective companies.\n\nNow the market is flooded with this stock. Who is going to buy it? The price will drop precipitously. Now the company can't afford to keep running and we have just caused major damage to some of the largest companies that the world relies on.\n\nHow is that helpful?\n\nThis is why it is not a simple Yes or no question. There is more going on that can be answered from pledge gleaned solely from headlines.\n\nStop promoting ignorance.\nZellNorth: I wanted the person I responded to to answer the question. Whether the information in the question is accurate or not is actually also irrelevant. I made no claims to be presenting facts or statistic. \nLiberty_Call: So why are you refusing to answer questions? Let's try a simple one.\n\nDo you think it is appropriate to destroy some of the largest and most important companies in the world right Now in the name of changing the statistic you are asking people about?\nZellNorth: I\u2019m refusing to answer irrelevant questions. I\u2019m not talking about a statistic. I used a relevant headline to ask a question. My question is philosophical not political. You\u2019re asking me political questions. \nLiberty_Call: Why are you refusing to think past the surface level here? There is little value in talking about something without trying to understand it.\n\nPhilisophically, it is important to take into account what it actually means that so few people have that much money, and what it would look like if that were not allowed to happened.\n\nIn the end with the billionaires be fine? Oh yeah.\n\nBut the workers losing their jobs, ther economy, technological development, and quality of life would all suffer in the process.\n\nSo to answer your question, in today's world it is better to have those few rich people because of what it would mean to undo that.\nZellNorth: You\u2019re in so many logical fallacies right now that it\u2019s actually impressive. Slippery Slope, Strawman, Hasty Generalizations, Ad Hominem. All that to still not answer my question. Unless I\u2019m supposed to assume your answer is \u201cyes\u201d. You\u2019re adding your own stipulations and answering questions I didn\u2019t ask. \nLiberty_Call: Instead of just listing a bunch of stuff off, why don't you point out how I am actually making those falacies?\n\nThe reality is that taking that moeny from those people would not happen in a vacuum. Their companies would be carved up, people would los4e their jobs, and things would be worse than they are now.\n\nIf you disagree, feel free to explain why, but don't just stick your fingers in your ears and refuse to participate because everyone is not tripping over themselves to agree with your view point.\n\nNow, do you actually care about the question you asked, or was this just a cry for attention?\nZellNorth: You don\u2019t even know what my view point is cause you never answered my question...\nLiberty_Call: I have answered your question multiple times now if you would pay attention, but if you need it simplified even more...\n\nGiven the current state of the world, that break down of wealth mentioned is fine.\n\nNow, did you actually care about the question, or was this just a cry for attention?\nZellNorth: Again, you\u2019re answering your own question not mine. No this isn\u2019t a cry for attention but I\u2019m not interested in your opinion on politics. I\u2019ll ask it again, maybe you forgot. It\u2019s a simple yes or no question. \n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s ok for 26 people to have more money than 3 billion people combined\u201d\nLiberty_Call: Then my answer is yes as I have stated multiple times.\n\nIf I explain my answer you think that means I no longer answered the question?\n\nWhy am I not allowed to explain my answer?\nZellNorth: You\u2019re allowed to do whatever you want lol. The issue isn\u2019t that you\u2019re explaining your answer, it\u2019s that you\u2019re answering questions I didn\u2019t ask to lead to a conclusion I possibly wasn\u2019t heading towards. \n\nSo you don\u2019t believe wealth is better off spread out among the population? \nLiberty_Call: I can't answer that without knowing what the mechanism would be for redistribution. A more fair distribution would obviously be prefered, but this is the real world we are talking about, not a pipedream, and thus my opinions will reflect reality.\n\nEquality of opportunity is crucial to ensure that everyone has a fair shot at achieving their dreams. \n\nEquality of outcome starts to become more evil because you are not allowing people to benefit fully from their own labor and risk, while people that are not contributing their fair share end up with a free ride that just hurts the rest of society.\n\nSo through which mechanism would the redistribution be enforced?\nZellNorth: Who said anything about redistribution? Again, you\u2019re thinking too much. My question is ethical, not political. If given the choice between evenly distributed wealth or a few having the majority of the world\u2019s currency, which would you choose?\nLiberty_Call: You are trying to ask a pointless question then. If we do not take into account the reality of the world around us, you are just making noise.\n\nTo go from the situation we have no to one that has a more equal distribution will require some sort of action, no?\nZellNorth: Yes and I\u2019m getting there but we have to ask the ethical question first. If there is no ethical dilemma there doesn\u2019t need to be any action taken. So if you think there is no reason to be alarmed by .000000005% of the population having a majority of the wealth there is no reason to even have a conversation. \n\nThe guy I responded to seemed to think there was some sort of villainification of the wealthy. \nLiberty_Call: &gt;So if you think there is no reason to be alarmed by .000000005% of the population having a majority of the wealth there is no reason to even have a conversation. \n\nI never said I was not alarmed.\n\nWhy are you making things up and attributing them to me?\nZellNorth: I said \u201cif\u201d. I\u2019m asking questions to find where you stand. I don\u2019t know what questions to ask you cause you spend so many responses not answering my question (:\nLiberty_Call: You dont know what questions to ask because you refuse to read what I am writing and take it into account.\n\nYou are demanding that I pretend this is not happening in the real world, which is ridiculous and pointless.\n\nRead what my responses are saying instead of just discounting them out of hand.\n\nYou have also not explained why you are making stuff up and claiming I am stating it. Why are you acting in such bad faith?\nZellNorth: That\u2019ll lead to having two different conversations. I refuse to answer your questions cause they are irrelevant to what I\u2019m asking. I don\u2019t know what to ask you cause you kept trying to change the subject. \nLiberty_Call: So you resort to making stuff up and pretending I said it?\n\nWhy?\nZellNorth: I didn\u2019t make anything up. Go reread what I said. \nLiberty_Call: So if that was really just a question and not accusatory, how were you supposed to figure that out without letting me explain my reasoning for my opinion?\n\nThis still sounds like you just wanted people to agree with you and won't engage with anyone that is not just blindly agreeing.\nZellNorth: My goal in any discussion is to find the common ground. I\u2019m not here to debate. The us vs them mentality that exists in this current climate has made people forget how to have a discussion. For instance, in this conversation I was trying to find the thing we can both agree with, \u201cspreading the wealth is fundamentally morally good\u201d. That\u2019s the thing I thought we could all agree on. If that\u2019s the case the discussion can then become, how do we achieve that. We would have gotten to redistribution of wealth eventually and then maybe a debate could ensue. But if we have no common ground to stand on, it\u2019s not even a debate, thats an argument. \n\nYour first initial response to me was instantly to create a wall. You defended your point when I didn\u2019t even attack it. I would actually tend to agree with you, but you weren\u2019t interested in a conversation you were interested in being right. Maybe you thought you could prove your point so well I would concede you to be the better man, I don\u2019t know. \n\nThe man in the original article we are commenting on sees the value in redistribution of wealth and I\u2019d love to see more of that. How can we come to a conclusion that sees money spread out among more of the population. We can only figure that when we all decide that it\u2019s the right thing to do. \nLiberty_Call: Then you should really approach the situation in a more open minded way rather than the us (the poor) vs them (the rich) way you have been.\n\n&gt; I was trying to find the thing we can both agree with, \u201cspreading the wealth is fundamentally morally good\u201d.\n\nThis depends on quite a bit. I firmly believe in and follow the mantra, \"From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.\n\nThat means if someone is not performing and contributing to society to the best of their ability, it is actually harmful to redistributed wealth to those folks.\n\nIt is not as simple as just ensuring equality of outcome because that is bad for the people that contrubute.\n\nWhen u started talki.g about what the redistribution of wealth would look like you refused to talk about it.\n\nStop trying to over simplify complex situations. It does not do any good and only fosters ignorance.\n\nNow that you have admitted that redistribution was what you were driving towards this whole time, what will that look like? How do you redistribute wealth that is tied up in assets that are need to keep the economy running and people working?\nZellNorth: I was never given a chance to be open minded cause you kept changing the subject. I was attempting to keep the conversation on topic. \n\nRedistribution like what the gentleman in the article did is a good start. I\u2019m over this conversation though. Took way too long to get here and my attention is gone. \nLiberty_Call: You need to ask questions that can be answered by people that understand what is going on.\n\nIf you really cared about this topic you would not be asking yes or no questions and getting upset when people try to get more info or answer them appropriately.\n\nStop pretending to care then getting upset when someone is informed enough to realize your questions are silly and unanswerable in good faith.\nZellNorth: lol ok\n", "prompt": "speckz: Aldi introduces wages higher than the \u2018real living wage\u2019 after supermarket has record year\n\nraliberti2: ..and they maintain reasonable prices on their products so people can actually afford to eat well\ngiuseppe443: and the owner of aldi s\u00fcd was until his death in", "orig": "2014 the richest man in germany \nTrumpImpeachedAugust: That's an aspect of wealth inequality that *really* pisses me off.

There's a lot of information out there right now, and I can't help but feel like a more constructive and productive community could have helped him. Seems like he was a loner and social outcast. Standing by himself at parties, etc\nsuburiboy: I've actually been thinking about this a lot.  I have SA and GAD, and probably Dysthymia.  I'm a middling college student, a virgin, and come from a fairly well off background.  I have trouble getting girls to talk to me, or even meeting people(of either sex) in general.  I go for long walks at night, alone, to record my thoughts.  The police said that he was \"Eurasian\"... So am I.  I have some low level fear that if someone hurt me, I could become like him... It is a frightening thought.  To be clear, I haven't read the manifesto, so I only know what the news media is saying.\n\nThat being said.  Once someone convinces themselves that they are going to do this, there is very little way to stop them mid stream.  This sort of thing needs to start young.  IDK if there was an inciting moment early in life, but he should have been examined as soon as symptoms started to appear.  There are tons of small cultural things that I think contribute to this, stuff.\n\nOne thing that frustrates me is that my brain makes everything hurt, but no one, other than my therapist, acknowledges that my pain is real.  They would say things like \"it's all in your head.\"  Well, yes it is, but that doesn't make it hurt less.  I feel like years of people telling me to \"get over\" my pain because it was \"all in my head\" aggravated my condition to where it is now.  I have the opposite problem as Rodgers in this respect.  My entire life, I was told to blame myself, and i still do.  I'm still learning to love the real me, and not blame myself when things get out of hand.  Rodgers felt like everything was someone else's fault.  Might these be opposed reactions to the same stimuli?  idk, but i'd believe it..  \n\nTreating mental illness as an actual disability would be a good start.  That way we can get these people coping mechanisms, support networks, and other things so keep them sane.  Often people get fired from a job for having SA.  So you can't fire a woman for getting pregnant, but you can fire me for having SA?  one of those things is a choice(broadly speaking, I understand that accidents do happen), one is a disease.  I don't think that we should be shamed for a thing that is outside of our control.\n\nI guess I'm talking a bit about myself, but I feel like that is the point.  As much as commentators are trying to make this kid seem like an anomaly, in truth, is is not that different from us.  When I hear how shocked commentators are, I can't help but think that these people have not read Catcher in the Rye, and that frustrates me.  Being lonely has sucked for as long as people have been lonely.\n\nthat was a ramble.  I promise I'm ok... just frustrated.\nazcard: I can relate to a lot of this. When friends/family tell me I'm just overthinking or to get over it they think I can just switch it off. \n\nI'm trying to know what the real me is as well. I feel like I've protected it for so long that I don't know who that is anymore. Instead, I continually try to learn more about myself so I can attempt to improve. So I'm fighting on finding who I really am or was - while trying to get better and finding a non depressed, non anxiety me.\n\nHow has therapy worked for you? I plan on starting very soon.\nsuburiboy: When i was young, 11-13 I saw several child psychologists, and hated it.  They would always talk down to me.  I just didn't want to be there and I was not ready for it.  I had a really bad indecent in 8th grade; then I started to see a good psychiatrist for a years, and i credit him with getting me through highschool without falling apart. \n\nRecently I was thrown in jail.  I was being questioned by police and had a panic attack, which they thought was suspicious.  After that, I started seeing a counselor at uni for 3 or 4 months, and she was really helpful.  That was the first time I had heard of SA or GAD or Disthymia, which are things she thought I may have.  (I then got a second opinion and that person wanted to put my on anti depressants immediately.)  The counselor told me that this condition is not my fault, and that I should not be ashamed of it.  I find that this has been a really helpful way to think about it.  I have low self-esteem, so realizing that I didn't need to hate myself when i couldn't do things, actually makes things much easier.  Also just having a person to talk though your problems with is super useful, and makes you feel less lonely.\n\nazcard: Thank you for your response. What's weird is I don't think its completely my fault, but it doesn't make it any easier for me. Saying it a few times in my head is different then somehow fully believing it.\n\nDid the anti depressants work well for you? How often do you take them? I have anxiety even thinking about it because I am very cautious about being addicted to meds. I do not have any history of addiction just the negative stories of otherr.\nsuburiboy: i've not been on drugs.  The timeline was complicated and we never got around to it.  So i really cannot help you with that.  My step mother is on some anti depressants, and she is having a very positive experience, so I would not be afraid to try it.\n\nI have a job downtown starting on tuesday, so If that end's up being bad I may see my psychiatrist here and ask about it.\n", "prompt": "MulhollandDrive: Knowing what we know about Elliot Rodgers right now, what could he have done differently to avoid the destructive path he took?\nKnowing what we know about Elliot Rodgers right now, what could he have done differently to avoid the destructive path he took?

It\u2019s tricky though, because when I hear people say they want sex, there are 2 main camps I see people fall into.\n\nThe first are people who want sex and nothing more, so a prostitute would fix their problem. The biggest barrier is money and access, so the conversation turns to that.\n\nThe second camp are people who wouldn\u2019t be happy going to a prostitute, because they want a genuine connection with the woman they\u2019re having sex with. I find that in a lot of these conversations, the desire for sex is a proxy for the desire to be desired.\n\nWhich of these two camps feels closer to where you are in your situation?\n[deleted]: The second camp definitely\nBotAtHackEr: Ah, got it, so it sounds like, in addition to sex, having a girlfriend is also about feeling desired. If it\u2019s the second camp, my guess it\u2019s not just sexual desire either, but more of a general \u201cI want someone who cares about me.\u201d Is that more or less accurate?\n[deleted]: Yes\nBotAtHackEr: Hm if that\u2019s the case, then the first thing I end up thinking about is, what are other ways to get what you want, i.e. someone who cares about you? I think a girlfriend can be that person, but I also feel like friends can also fill that role. \n\nObviously friends can\u2019t provide sex, so there\u2019s that caveat. But I feel like having a friend who cares about you is pretty similar to having a girlfriend who cares about you. What are the biggest differences for you?\n[deleted]: The biggest difference is definitely sex. But also the intimacy really\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, sex is a big one. What do you mean by intimacy, like physical? Emotional?\n[deleted]: Both\nBotAtHackEr: Yeah, being physically intimate with friends isn\u2019t really an option for a lot of people. Emotionally though, it might be comparable.\n\nWhat would it look like to be emotionally intimate with someone? Is that something you could try with a friend?\n[deleted]: Well I guess I could be emotionally intimate with a friend. Although for me it would be liking me for who I am really.\nBotAtHackEr: That\u2019s a reasonable thing to want, and I feel like a friend, a good one at least, should like you for who you are.

It's his property, yes, but I preferred some notice before having someone come muck about in the middle of my things. So he just gives me heads up if he needs to come by for his biannual maintenance.

With how expensive it is to live here, we need renters protection against greedy landlords.\nkevin_the_dolphoodle: It\u2019s definitely good to have these protections. I own a home that I used to rent out. I gave the tenants 120 days notice to move out. I was legally obliged to give them 60, but I wanted to give them as much time as possible to find a new living situation. In the end I had to evict them and they totally took advantage of me.

The commenter's brother offered to leave the apartment (giving up his legally given rent controlled status in exchange for the landlord buying him out) so the landlord could rent it out at current market rates.\naethelmund: AH that makes more sense now, I get it.

In the course of defending his findings, he was asked to leave his research group,\" the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement. \"However, his battle eventually forced scientists to reconsider their conception of the very nature of matter \u2026 Scientists are currently experimenting with using quasicrystals in different products such as frying pans and diesel engines.\"\n\n&gt;In an interview this year with the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, Shechtman said: \"People just laughed at me.\" He recalled how Linus Pauling, a colossus of science and a double Nobel laureate, mounted a frightening \"crusade\" against him.

Of course there are conservative scientists and progressive religious types, but I'm sure for every conservative scientist you find me, I can find you ten progressive/liberal ones, and for every progressive religious person, I can find you ten prominent conservative religious types. More to the point of what I was getting at is that this is how it *feels* to be, science is progressive and religion is conservative. I guess I'll just say why I think this is: Scientists want to know what is right, the religious want to feel like they know what is right. If what the religious thought was right is constantly changing, they can never be certain whether what they know is really correct or not. Nowadays, religion needs to be progressive if it wants to survive, but that is because its being pushed by progressive science and social change. \n\nReligion has stayed religion because it doesn't really have anywhere to go; its a bunch of stuff people thought up to explain the world, and then they attached their wildest dreams of ultimate justice and eternal life to it. Furthermore, religion *claims* to be the basis upon which philosophy is founded, it claims to know the beings which established thought itself and morality and so on. I think if anything, religion will eventually change *into* mere philosophy, instead of being something that merely contains philosophy, seeing as belief in the supernatural wanes when it comes into contact with scientific information (that is to say, knowledge of how the world actually works) and that information is only going to spread more rapidly with the advent of the internet.\nUberMonkey21: but you didn't say \"most\".\n\nbut your idea intrigues me.\n&gt;I think if anything, religion will eventually change into mere philosophy, instead of being something that merely contains philosophy, seeing as belief in the supernatural wanes when it comes into contact with scientific information\n\nare you then saying that religion(s) will converge as the supernatural disappears, i.e. walking on water, and the underlying ethics, i.e. the golden rule, become more apparent? \nOnce converged, would it, when stripped of all mysticism, be purely altruistic?\nWould it actually work then, i.e., following the golden rule, or would become corrupted as it has before/is?\n\n  \nkadmylos: Not necessarily converge, though they do all have that core of the Golden Rule, etc, but they all have their differences too.

Otherwise I appreciate your time.\n\n\nI am 30 yo, 193 cm (6\u20194\u201d) and 83.5 kg (184 lbs). I guess purely based on these numbers not that bad, but still what you probably would call skinny fat, but now I feel like I want to change this. See http://imgur.com/a/Al8L9 for pictures (sorry for the angles).\n\n\nLet me first introduce my story by a few lines.\n\n\nNever done a lot of exercising in the past. 4 years ago, I graduated from university and since then I am working as software engineer and consultant which hasn\u2019t been that positive in terms of my physical performance (100% of time sitting behind computer.). I like my job very much, I would say I am very ambitious and feel very responsible for all that happens. Then after 1 year of working I started developing RSI symptoms (cold hands, painful wrists, not able to lay your arms onto anything really), for which I saw numerous specialist of which none of them could help me and told me that I would have to live with it, and so I did. Then after a couple of months I started developing neck and back pain, which got through to my head as headaches. I never called myself in sick though, and continued working like a mad man, most weeks longer than needed and even in the evening colleagues got replies to their e-mails from me. I started seeing Cesar (I guess that term is only used in NL) and Mensendieck therapists to improve my posture and went to manual therapists to somehow improve my back and neck pain, but it never cured it. Then in summer last year, I started getting real dizzy, a couple of times (almost) fainting and a neurologist concluded it was chronical hyperventilation. I got breathing and relaxation therapy which helped somewhat until December last year I got tingling issues in both legs and arms and stings in my head and got again very dizzy. It was only then that I realized I could not continue like that, and called myself in sick.\n\n\nSo went back to the GP, and after some checks again with neurologist he concluded psychosomatic symptoms. Seeing psychology therapist now, and continuing Cesar therapy and manual therapy, and things got a little better, though I am not cured. Working only 2 half days a week. Though since last week I feel things got a tiny little better.\n\n\nIn the meantime, I am trying everything to get rid of my issues, of which one is bodyweight fitness.\n\n\nMy overall goal, body mind wise:\n\n* Getting and feeling stronger, not like a 70 yo in a 30 yo body..\n* I\u2019d like to get leaner (get rid of fatty manboobs and belly)..\n\nWhat I am doing now (next to therapies):\n\n* 3 x a week recommended routine (since ~2 months) to get strength back in core, and I actually feel like it\u2019s fun, though I\u2019m a little bit impatient. Would like to get to freestanding HS eventually and getting leaner and more body. Already saw quite some progress in terms of planking times, but also moved from vertical rows to almost horizontal, wall pushup to full push up. Doing L-sit with one leg up now, etc.\n* 1 x a week Yoga (since a month), more of a relaxation yoga with only 7 poses and finishing off with half an hour of meditation\n* Loads of walking\n* On average 1 x swimming a week\n* On average 0 \u2013 1 x running a week (0.5 hrs)\n* Reading \u201cThe mindbody prescription\u201d on TMS of John Sarno to understand how the psychosomatic symptoms are developed and how to influence them. I realize now that it may indeed be repressed childhood trauma that causes my symptoms.\n* Doing some meditation on my own using Headspace app\n* Applying rational emotive therapy\n* I\u2019m on Keto diet with 20% calorie deficit, I guess this also helps me to feel a little more energized, and hopefully it gets me a bit leaner without destroying muscles. I feel like it, but I do not see a lot of progress now I am looking at my own pictures.\n\n\nNow I am curious what you think about what I am doing at the moment! Should I change something?  Am I doing too much, or too little? Do you see progress in the pics? I could ask very specific questions which I won\u2019t, so I hope to get more general feedback as well. One specific question though, what bf % do you think I have now?\n\nyaoz889: You seem to be progressing, which is great. Just make sure you consume enough protein, so you maintain your gains. I suggest you add jump rope if you can, just to increase the speed of your progression. Like 5-10 min in the mornings right after you wake up.\nKrygess: Would 5-10 minutes of early morning jump rope be more for cardio or to increase calorie deficit? That sounds like an easy enough thing to implement for me. Just would like to know what it would benefit most. \nyaoz889: More for cardio. If you look at the research online, jumping rope is up there as one of the top excercises out there. However, jumping 10min straight is not easy.\nI just started a few weeks ago and I just try the best I can every morning.\nKrygess: I really just meant devoting the time to it. Not actually jumping rope for that long straight. I'm optimistic for the most part, but that'd be dumb to think I could do it right away. \n\nBut thanks for the information! I really needed cardio but couldn't find something I actually enjoyed. I'll give this a try! \nyaoz889: Make sure you get a good rope though. There is a difference in quality between the wire ones coated with plastic and the pure plastic ones\nKrygess: I had not even thought about that... Thanks! Which one is better quality? \nyaoz889: Personally, I bought this one: https://www.amazon.com/WOD-Wear-Adjustable-Speed-Cable/dp/B0107QTSI6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1489447192&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=wod+nation+speed+jump+rope\n\nA very good quality rope.

{"full_text": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for. Rather, I have once heard of a study citing that skipping breakfast can trigger an insulin response which would immediately store any and all calories ingested throughout the day into fat. \n\n\nDoes this have any credibility behind it? Does skipping breakfast help your weight loss personally? \nscreepatrol: Any studies that have weird findings about skipping meals or eating 8 meals a day or whatever are either 1) paid for their results by the industry or 2) terribly controlled. \n\nEat once a day. Eat 8 times a day. Eat only during a certain period or snack all day. Your body is great at partitioning calories and the effects of when you eat that food are somewhere between negligible and nonexistent. \n\nToo often people look at what professional bodybuilders/weightlifters/strongmen do and think that's how you succeed. Those guys are at the top level and the only thing left is to focus on the last 1%. The other 99% is controlling your calories/macros and progressive overload in training. \n\nDon't overthink this. \nSpicyThingy: Its not about the calories. Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000% which leads to better fat burning and better muscle growth. That doesnt have to do with sponsorships, it is just measureing. \nNihilii: &gt; increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over\n\nSo is it up to, or is it over? Or does \"up to over 1000%\" mean anywhere between 0 and infinity? I mean that would surely be correct, but not very useful.\n\nAnd do you have any source for those revelations?\nSpicyThingy: Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass. \nNihilii: &gt;Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass.\n\nWell, it's not my first language either, and \"up to and over\" is a classic marketing spiel (that crops up not just in english), which is why I'm giving you attitude for doing it. \n\nBut to the point - your own source, a single study mind you, so not a very strong ground to declare something as a hard fact, has found a 1000% increase in mean GH level after **5 days of fasting**. They were also **injecting the subjects with Growth-Hormone Releasing Hormone**. Based on that you say this:\n\n&gt;Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\nSo even forgetting that slip of the tongue there, you are still clearly suggesting that just intermittent fasting can give you a tenfold GH increase. This is naive at best, and purposefully misleading at worst. How can you consider that study in any way comparable to a person doing something like a typical 16/8 intermittent fasting schedule? \n\nSeriously. You either haven't read the paper you linked or you're sensationalizing this on purpose. I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nYou don't get to pull the asshole card when you're lying to people.\nthoughtihadanacct: While the 1000% claim by u/SpicyThingy may be an exaggeration (deliberate or not I can\u2019t say), it is also unfair of you to entirely discredit the study he cited based on the reasons you have given.\n\nIn figures 2 and 3 and table 1 of the study, it clearly shows that GH concentration increases from fasting even on day 1. Yes the effect on day 1 may be lower than on day 5, and again the 1000% claim may have been misleading. However you seem to be implying that the benefits of fasting with regard to HGH only happen after 5 days, and you claim that the study in no way has bearing on 16:8 fasting. The fact that there is some (albeit lower) effect on day 1 of fasting suggests that 16/8 fasting may have some benefits (albeit lower than say 5 day fasting).\n\nYou boldly state that the reserchers injected the subjects with GHRH, in an attempt to discredit the study. This was dishonest. While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed. And from fig 2 the effects of the injection do not last more than about 3 hours. The injections were done to investigate the effect of fasting on GHRH sensitivity. (True the study could have been \u201cbetter\u201d by focusing on only one thing at a time, but it stands that the injections don\u2019t negate the findings regarding GH release.)\n\nIn the end what Im saying is that it\u2019s not binary - ie it\u2019s not \u201cfasting results in 1000% increase in GH\u201d vs \u201cbullshit the study is meaningless/useless\u201d. What I\u2019m arguing is that fasting does increase GH levels to some extent. More (longer) fasting results in more increase. The exact magnitude of increase is variable and probably differs from person to person.\nNihilii: I never said the study is meaningless. I said what the guy said was misleading and even the single study he picked to support his position does not do so. You can't just sling around some numbers from a study without looking at the context. This was an extremely sloppy attempt at backing one's claims with science.\n\n&gt;While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed.\n\nWell, that's my bad then. It was not clear to me from the study design that the post-GHRH injection measurements were not included in the later analysis and I can't honestly say I read the thing front-to-back since it was pretty late that night.

Such as their claim that there is an epidemic of black people killed by the police just for being black when there isn't.\nChips1001: While I agree that supporting every single movement like BLM is impossible it isn't the same as your doctor analogy. People don't need hundreds of hours of specialized training to support those kinds of movement like doctors do. \n\nAlso supporting a movement isn't really that hard. You don't need to attend a BLM rally or a LGBT parade to show your support. You can do it by supporting them on social media or donating to them or doing other similar things.

There is literally not enough hours in the day to protests for all available causes. Even if you don't go to a rally and just want to donate 10$ for a cause. Donating 10$ for every cause is a whole lot of money. Also not every charity does what they say they do. A lot of times those charities are just scams and their CEOs make huge piles of money for not doing anything.\n\nBy the way, what you're saying is that all lives matter.

BLM are trying to end racism against African Americans and ALM, at least in theory, wants to end racism.

After all, marriage should be based upon love and mercy, as stated in the Quran, and part of a healthy sexual relationship is the mutual pleasure experienced by both parties. Any form of sexual violence has been and always will be unlawful in Islam. [...]\n\n[...] Since mutual pleasure is one of the acknowledged purposes of lawful sex, it naturally cannot be attained by force, compulsion, or violence.\"\n\nThis opinion has been held by scholars since the early days. Its from people who studied Islam and who know Islam better then we do combined.\n\nHere. Its unlawful to do that. \n\nIt doesnt need to be called rape to be unlawful. Just shows your ignorance.\n\nAlso, you cannot learn Islam from just a few articles, which is why you have such a wrong and misinformed view that is so easy to call out.\nGaMa-Binkie: So you don't actually site anything from the Quran that would specifically go against the definition \n&gt; \"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse **by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him**, without her free will and consent\".\n\nIf they thought raping your wife was wrong why would they specifically say \"who is not legally married to him\" why not leave this part out?\n\nThe intention is clear and 31 Islamic countries following this definition just confirms it\nEliotisnotconfused: Dear Lord are you stupid?\n\nJust because it isnt called \"rape\" doesnt mean that ITS ALLOWED. \n\nThis site is from scholars. They know Islam more then you do. They also got their opinion FROM the Quran, because the Quran says that marriage is for love and that pleasure should be for both. \n\nIf a man rapes his wife, was there pleasure for both? No. Therefore, its not allowed.\n\nYou dont get Islam and arent ready for an Islamic discussion even at its lowest level.\nGaMa-Binkie: Lol, the cognitive dissonance is palpable.\n\nIf they think it's wrong, why did they specifically leave it out of the definition, thus making it legal.\nEliotisnotconfused: Youre stupid. Borderline stupid....\n\nYou simply dont understand Islam. \n\nRape is different back then then it was today. Marriage is different in Islam then it is to you Westerners. \n\nMarriage by itself is some form of \"consent\", as its a very important bond between a man and a woman and they only marry under important conditions, unlike in the West, were marriage isnt like that, but as I said Marriage still has its rules and conditions. \n\nOne of these conditions is that pleasure has be for both. So while its technically not seen as \"rape\" its still is not allowed and will be punished if violent sex acts are forced upon a partner, as it will not lead to pleasure and love for both. \n\nAlso, theres a hadith that says that the best men are those who are kind to their wives. \n\nSo how can a man that forces his wife for sex be lawful in Islam, as it goes against the rules for men and against the conditions for marriage????\n\nThink and use your brain. Before you reply, think about it for 20 minutes very clearly and open mindedly. Hopefully then you will understand why youre wrong.\nGaMa-Binkie: Lol, saying men who are kind to their wives are the coolest isn\u2019t justification for having marital rape legalised.\n\nThe definition specifically allows for it, there is no argument to be had\nEliotisnotconfused: Thanks for admitting that you do not understand Islam, even after its explained to you. \n\nDo not argue about Islam, as youre the most ignorant person Ive ever seen. \n\nIve shown proof, I shown that forced sex is against the conditions of marriage, but you still say its allowed.\n\nOne more time:\n\nIts not definded as the WORD \"Rape\". ITS JUST NOT CALLED THE WORD RAPE.  But it STILL ISNT ALLOWED. \n\nIf you deny this, then youre one of the dumbest, most ignorant and idiotic people that exist. \n\nJust because its not in the definition of rape doesnt mean its allowed. HOW HARD IS IT TO UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU MORON?\nGaMa-Binkie: Not including marital rape under the definition of rape shows that they don\u2019t hold it in that regard. \n\nMost Islamic countries following this definition and having marital rape legalised and go unpunished further confirms it.\n\nYou are trying to justify the un-justifiable, which you\u2019ve proven is impossible with your weak, incoherent and inconsistent arguments\nEliotisnotconfused: Its not rape, but it still is forbidden. How hard is it to understand? \n\nI even explained why its forbidden.\nGaMa-Binkie: Think for a second, why would it be explicitly excluded from the definition of it was Haram\nEliotisnotconfused: Are you fucking braindead?\n\nIts excluded from the definition because its not rape in Islam.\n\nBut that doesnt make it allowed. Sins can be not rape, but still be forbidden. \n\nIt doesnt need to be rape to not be allowed. Why do you think this?\n\nAnd I already explained WHY its forbidden multiple times, as it goes against the conditions marriage. \n\nTheres no argument to be had. Its not rape, but still forbidden as it goes against the conditions of marriage and sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. \n\nUse your brain. I explained it enough times now, you idiot.\nGaMa-Binkie: Why go to the effort of excluding it from the definition of rape if it\u2019s forbidden anyway?\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s Hala to sexually assault your wife \ud83e\udd14\nEliotisnotconfused: Its not rape. \n\nBut its still forbidden. \n\nTwo things can be true at once. \n\nAnd I told you WHY it was forbidden already.\nGaMa-Binkie: Nope, under Islam marriage counts as forever consent so there\u2019s no punishment for raping your wife\n\nIslam and most of its followers approve of this definition\nEliotisnotconfused: The article I showed disproves that. Read it, as it explains that very well.\n\nMarriage has rules. Forcing your wife is against that, as it doesnt mean pleasure for both and marriage is kindness and love towards each other. Violence has no place in that. \n\nAnd no, most of muslims do not approve. Im muslim and have touch to the muslim community aswell as knowledge about it.

{"full_text": "jackgary118: In Defence of Strong Emergentist Panpsychism\n\nucanttaketheskyfrome: This article provides two reasons to reject physicalism - the theory that we can explain consciousness with only physical entities. First, the \"transparent conceivability\" argument: because we can conceive of a consciousness-less world where physicalism is true, physicalism does not entail consciousness. Second, the knowledge argument: a person with all the data about an experience still \"learns\" something when they actually experience it. These two arguments are supposed to be compelling reasons to reject physicalism. Are they?\n\nThe first argument equates conceivable with possible, but the fact that zombies are conceivable does not mean that they are possible. Even at my most charitable, I do not understand why \"we can imagine a conscious-less world of physicalism\" is any sort of adequate refutation. The fact that we lack the knowledge to find a contradiction between physicalism and the zombie thesis does not mean there isn't one; we should be more reluctant to discard physicalism. To a physicalist, a zombie is nonsensical. It would be like postulating if the concept of \"health\" evaporates if we compare two identical people, and one of them are missing an organ. \"Consciousness\" could simply be an emergent property of the physical interaction of neurons. This does not demand any mental state.\n\nThe second argument is problematic because I don't think Mary \"learns\" something phenomenal. It sounds like she is just seeing new ways to represent facts she already knows. The \"knowledge\" was acquired prior; her experience with red outside the black-and-white-room is not new. We could test this by showing her something non-red, and asking her to identify the content based on what she has learned about red from inside the room. Alternatively, if she couldn't learn the knowledge from in the room, a better way to resolve this problem is to ask whether this is a kind of knowledge that can't be learned from within the room but still physical. Why do we assume this kind of knowledge isn't simply physical knowledge? This rests on how you define \"physicality\". This is just a word game; I can make it so that physicalism can totally account for consciousness by broadening or narrowing the definition to include Mary's knowledge.\n\nedit: word choice, see infra\ndnew: &gt; The fact that zombies are conceivable \n\nI've never seen an argument supporting that p-zombies are conceivable, either. I've just heard people assert that p-zombies are conceivable, without any evidence that they're not logically inconsistent. (And some have given good arguments as to why they're not logically consistent.) And, as you say, even if it were logically consistent, that says nothing about reality.  \"There might be a different universe somewhere in which X happens, therefore X happens.\"\n\nI mean, they're named \"zombies\" for a reason, right?  \"Fred is not alive. He is in every way measurable to science as though he were alive, and no doctor would be able to tell he's not alive, but *really* he doesn't have the essence of life that makes him alive. He just acts that way.\"  If anyone *today* argued that such a thing made sense, we'd scoff.\n\n&gt; The second argument is problematic \n\nThe second argument is also problematic because Mary is asserted to learn something new when she sees red, but that begs the question. The question is \"does Mary learn something new?\" To assert \"Well, yes, obviously\" doesn't actually argue the point.  I assert that Mary's knowledge is so inconceivably vast, so unintuitively complete, that one's intuition about whether or not she learns something is impossible to deduce without carrying out the experiment.\nFlexography: &gt; I've never seen an argument supporting that p-zombies are conceivable, either\n\nIt's not a claim which requires an argument.  If I say \"I can conceive of a blue tennis ball\", what argument could I possibly provide for that?  Sure, I could give some examples of ways that it's logically consistent, but if you are determined to reject my assertion, then I can never satisfy you, because there are an infinite number of considerations I would need to respond to.\nIf, on the other hand, you think that zombies are *not* conceivable, it's up to *you* to demonstrate why.  \n\n&gt;  I assert that Mary's knowledge is so inconceivably vast, so unintuitively complete, that one's intuition about whether or not she learns something is impossible to deduce without carrying out the experiment\n\nA Physicalist *cannot* take this line of argument.  If it is impossible to determine if Mary learned something new, then Physicalism is false.  If Physicalism is true, then there are only physical facts; thus, Mary--who has all of the physical facts--cannot learn something new.  If it is \"impossible to deduce\" whether or not Mary learns something new, Physicalism is false. \nlurkingowl: &gt; If, on the other hand, you think that zombies are not conceivable, it's up to you to demonstrate why.\n\nBecause it contradicts physicalism?\n\nIf your entire knock-out punch against physicalism is just a burden of proof argument, it's not really a knock-out punch or even good logic, it's just rhetoric.\n\nIf it's *not* a burden of proof argument, then you need to actually prove your claims.\nFlexography: The conceivability of zombies does not contradict Physicalism.  A Physicalist can accept that zombies are conceivable, and many do.  \n\nIn any case, it would be sort of suspect to deny that epistemological claim *just because* it went against a prior commitment you had.  That would be really dishonest.  Whether or not something is conceivable is just a claim about what a person can conceive of.  It doesn't mean anything other than *I can conceive of this thing*.  If you're going to say \"*Physicalism is true, therefore it's got to be impossible that zombies are conceivable*\", you're being dishonest because you are not accurately reporting whether or not zombies are conceivable.  You'd be saying \"well, on the version of Physicalism I subscribe to, zombies can't be conceivable, therefore they aren't conceivable\", then that would be putting the cart before the horse--you'd be presupposing a conclusion without argument, and dismissing contrary arguments by just asserting that conclusion, which isn't really how philosophy is done.  \nlurkingowl: You completely skipped my point:\n\nIf all you have is a burden of proof argument, *you haven't proven anything.*\n\nI'll stand by my belief (which you and anyone else who puts forward the conceivability argument agrees with) that the conceivability of zombies contradicts physicalism separately if you like.\nFlexography: Oh, well I addressed that in my first comment, which you were replying to (and sort of in my reply as well....).  Claims about conceivability are just claims about what you can conceive.  They have to do with whether ideas are logically consistent, whether certain things are contradictory, and so on.  If I say \"I can conceive of X\" there is literally no argument I could possibly provide that would convince you that X is actually conceivable.  I would have to run through infinitely-many considerations in order to show that X is consistent.  If you think that X is not internally consistent--that is, that I cannot conceive of X--then it is up to you to show why.  All you need to do is show one contradiction that is internal to X.  \n\nIf something is inconceivable, there's a reason why--that is, if something is inconceivable, then there is something about that thing which *makes it inconceivable*.  The burden of proof is on you to show that it is inconceivable precisely because there is no way to prove that *anything* is conceivable.  How could I possibly prove the a blue tennis ball is conceivable?  If you were determined to reject blue tennis balls, I could never satisfy you, because I cannot possibly go through the infinite number of considerations I would have to respond to.  If, however, you think that blue tennis balls are *not* conceivable, you need to give one reason why.  For example \"tennis balls have felt, but it is logically impossible for felt to be blue, therefore you cannot conceive of a blue tennis ball\" or something like that.  If you can't provide a reason *why* the thing is inconceivable.... well then it's conceivable. \n\nAnd, again, the conceivability of zombies does not contradict Physicalism.  Physicalism is a claim about the world.  It is the claim that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff.  That is the Physicalist thesis.  The conceivability of zombies is not a claim about the world; it is a claim about what we can conceive of.  These things do not contradict each other in any way. \nlurkingowl: You're still not addressing the fact that all you're presenting (the way you're arguing this) is a burden of proof argument against physicalism.  If you're going to bring up conceivability, and try to use it as a point in an argument, you can't turn around in the middle and claim I'm failing a point you've presented no evidence for.  It's perfectly fine to say \"I believe there's a contradiction in there, but we don't understand the terms and processes well enough for me to spell it out.\"\n\n(Physicalism contradicts conceivability in a separate reply.)\nFlexography: We're not even talking about Physicalism at the moment.  We're talking about about what it takes for something to be conceivable.  For any conceivability argument, the burden of proof is *always* on the person who says that it is inconceivable.  If something is inconceivable, then it can be demonstrated that it is inconceivable.  However, it can NEVER be demonstrated that ANYTHING is conceivable. \n\nI've literally said multiple times there there is ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF any person could EVER provide that any X is conceivable such that you could convince someone that X is conceivable.  That's a basic logical fact about consistency.  \n\nInconsistency, on the other hand, does not require an infinite number of proofs.  It requires one--one example of a contradiction.  This is, again, a basic logical fact about inconsistency.  \n\nThe burden of proof is absolutely completely entirely 100% on the person who says that zombies are inconceivable.  \nlurkingowl: No, the burden of proof *in any argument* is 100% on the person making a positive claim.  If I'm not trying to use conceivability as part of an argument to draw a conclusion, I have absolutely no burden of proof.  I can happily continue on being a physicalist until someone figures out a way to make show that zombies are conceivable (or puts forward some other argument.)  The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\nFlexography: Here's an argument:\n\nP1) I can conceive of blue tennis balls\n\nP2) If I can conceive of blue tennis balls, then  blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nC1) Therefore blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\n\nI can offer absolutely no support for (P1) that would convince a skeptic that I can actually conceive of a blue tennis ball.  If you think that there is a burden of proof on me to somehow prove \"I can conceive of a blue tennis ball\" without having any sort of criticism of that claim to respond to, then this argument cannot go through, and we cannot conclude that blue tennis balls are logically consistent.  We can't even conclude that (P1)--that I can conceive of them--is true, since we can't give an argument for it.  But surely that's not right.  This argument is obviously valid, and we want to say that it's sound too.  We know that blue tennis balls are conceivable.  And if someone comes up to you tomorrow and says \"You totally can't conceive of blue tennis balls\", they better have a damn good reason for their assertion.  The burden of proof is on *them*.  *They* have to give a reason why we can't conceive of blue tennis balls.  We certainly think we are conceiving of them.  So if we are mistaken, they need to show why.  \n\n&gt; The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\n\nThis is simply untrue.  Physicalism is by definition a specific claim.  It is the claim that that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff. This is not controversial.  This is the definition of Physicalism. \nlurkingowl: &gt;&gt;The physicalist doesn't need to make a claim one way or another, because they're not trying to refute anything.\n\n&gt;This is simply untrue. Physicalism is by definition a specific claim. It is the claim that that all the stuff in the world is physical stuff, or that all the stuff is necessitated by, supervenes on, or is reducible to physical stuff. This is not controversial. This is the definition of Physicalism.\n\nYes, Physicalism is a specific claim.  I was saying that the physicalist doesn't need to present a detailed proof that zombies aren't conceivable.  The physicalist *isn't using it as the premise of an argument.*  They can happily say that inconceivability is a conclusion from their premises (plus the conceivability-&gt;metaphysical possibility claim.)  No part of their chain of reasoning depends on it.\n\nChalmers *is* using conceivability as the premise of an argument.  If the premise is false, the whole argument is invalid.\nFlexography: Here's an argument:\n\nP1) I can conceive of blue tennis balls\n\nP2) If I can conceive of blue tennis balls, then blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nC1) Therefore blue tennis balls are logically possible\n\nI can offer absolutely no support for (P1) that would convince a skeptic that I can actually conceive of a blue tennis ball.

They have to give a reason why we can't conceive of blue tennis balls. We certainly think we are conceiving of them. So if we are mistaken, they need to show why.  \n\nImagine if this person then said \"I don't need to give a reason why blue tennis balls are inconceivable.  The burden of proof is on you to prove that you can conceive of a blue tennis ball.  And until you do that, I don't have to put forth any argument\".  If that happened, you would not take this person seriously.  You know that it is not your job to prove that blue tennis balls are conceivable if you haven't been given any reason to think otherwise.  This person will *never* accept that blue tennis balls are conceivable, because it is literally impossible for you to prove that they are conceivable, since that would require that you respond to an infinite number of potential criticisms.

Whenever we went to new places, having her by my side made me feel really confident and boosted my selfesteem massively.
