{"full_text": "[deleted]: If an online friend frequently apologizes for slow replies over text, what does this imply?\n[deleted]\nPonytail77: I think it implies that the apology really isn't that sincere.  If you are truly sorry you try not to repeat it again.   \n\nThis friend is aware she's ignored your texts and so is trying to be polite by opening her reply repeatedly with a \"I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but...\"  \n\nIt basically shows they're busy and/or have other priorities.\n[deleted]: What she wrote was, \"Hey! Sorry for not answering for a long time - I was on vacation outside the city and there was no connection.\" She was honest about it because I saw from her stories, though when she replied it was like nine days past the New Year and I texted her on NYE. With that being said, my texts have always been very long so whether or not she was sincere it probably didn't matter that much. There's been a general trend of her replying once every week. But I've also noticed that when I wrote something that she didn't felt comfortable answering, for example I asked her if she liked to watch any Halloween movies over Halloween, then she took a longer time to reply and then came back at the end of November and apologized for being very busy (but only after I accidentally liked one of her IG photos which probably sent a notification to her phone). It's true that she was busy with something but no one could have probably been that busy that they would take a long time to reply to a text.\n\nBtw I also confronted her about this and it got really messy. But I get the sense that she wants to send meaningful replies rather than just \"one or two word texts,\" as she put it. So she may not have been sincere with the apology but she is probably sincere with the conversation. But also a part of me can't help but wonder if she feels pressured to apologize for slow replies after I nearly set an ultimatum on the conversation. I mean she's apologized in the past before for slow replies but I get the sense that she is probably going to apologize more often now out of any lingering pressure that she feels from me. I tried my best to move on from the confrontation but when something like that happens it's hard to forget. Now she's been busier with her life than before but yeah, I keep looking at it from my perspective and it's hard to come to terms with it. Like what if this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly..\nPonytail77: \"...this frequent apologizing could be a subtle sign that she wants me to back off indirectly\"\n\nFrom what you've said, I think this is the most likely answer. Rather than \"read between the lines\" as they say, she just takes her time in responding -politely of course- hoping you'll get the hint.\n[deleted]: But couldn't that have also been because my texts were very long? Maybe if my texts had been shorter she wouldn't have apologized?\n\nHere's a brief timeline of the texts: She replied on October 23. I replied on November 6. She replied on November 28. I replied on December 24. She replied on December 28. I replied on December 31. She replied on January 9. She started off her replies on November 28 and January 9 with apologies. I have not replied since. I have backed off by a lot already. Is it not enough??\nPonytail77: I would take a break until I heard from her.  Or at least another month or so. \n\nSounds like you want more from this friendship then she is willing or able to give right now.  If she's interested, she can reach out to you at any time too.\n[deleted]: That's what I was thinking too. Not just because she told me that she's starting a new job but also because I am not completely sure if I should open up more in my texts with her. What draws me to her is that she is able to answer in detail, with compassion, and with great energy. It's not like she answers in one to three sentences. Often she answers in five to ten sentences. It's clear that she puts effort into her messages even if her priorities have changed or whatnot, and as a result, I overshare with her sometimes.\n\nBut I am still unsure how much I actually matter to her. Any confrontation that involved making excessive demands would turn people off. Whether or not it's long term remains to be seen. She said she's not mad, and she said she still likes the communication. I believe her, but people can also subtly pull themselves away while still being very polite. Not to mention she lives in a foreign country where the main language isn't English. Of course she has an incentive to communicate in English.\n\nIf I still matter to her in some way or the other, then she'll eventually reach out like she did before. I hate to say this but this is my way of testing her. I hope to take a break and not reply to her until May and continue to do nothing (not watching her stories, not liking any of her posts). If she doesn't reach out again asking how I am doing before then like she used to that should say something about how she actually feels.\nDiabetaBun: \u201cI hope to take a break\u201d I think, is a good start. Not as far as testing her but for your own self. Whether she is being too kind to upkeep her conversation with you, or simply too busy, or find it hard to respond due to language limitations, whatever else the \u201cpossible\u201d explanation could be, it\u2019s always important to refrain from being emotionally codependent with or on another. Coming from a neutral standpoint, you can still have meaningful conversations with her and very much have an \u2018active\u2019 relationship while not expecting too much from it. It is pretty apparent that, at this current time, she is unable to meet your needs. That is okay. There is so much that we can do when it involves another but we do have control on how we choose to handle the situation. I suggest being open to others who can click with you and meet your needs. It won\u2019t minimize the respect you have for your friend and it will increase the respect you have for yourself.\n\nIn regards to the frequent apologies, it\u2019s kind of hard to say. It can be due to insecurities, or fear to disappoint, or it can be because she doesn\u2019t like late responses herself, or, on top of fear to disappoint, she just simply has an active life and she does feel bad to have anyone waiting on her because she believes on being that great friend. If that makes sense\u2026\n[deleted]: There's something else that she mentions more frequently than apologies, and that's starting almost every single text with a \"Hey!\" This is something that she has started doing ever since last October, right around the time when my overbearing attitude went to extremes. Maybe she just happened to pick up something new, but I wonder if using hey consistently is a good thing? I know starting a text with a \"hey\" is great because it's informal, but she's using this on every single text now. Could she be using this to maintain distance?\nDiabetaBun: 1.) Out if curiosity, how long have the two of you known each other? \n\n2.) We\u2019re splitting hairs at this point.\n\n3.) Social Media has downside effects on how people perceive what is appropriate in aspects that involve communication and interpersonal relationships. For example, it becomes an expectation/demand to receive a response. To expound further, if the sender of the text sees that the receiver has indeed seen the text but have not yet responded, it rises the senders anxiety levels which in turn may cause them to over think or over analyze. \n\nI\u2019m not saying anything negative so I hope you don\u2019t take it as such but rather consider this information and do something proactive about your perception on things in regards to sending and receiving texts or what the messages contain. Don\u2019t stress too much about it.\n\nIt seems you really enjoy her company and value her insights and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to distance ourselves from something we see as value. At this point, if it were me in your shoes, I would apologize for the demands I have made because it sets up unrealistic expectations for them and puts some sort of stress on the relationship whether it is big or small. From what you have shared thus far, it\u2019s very minor. So it\u2019s nothing really to worry about. Then I would proceed to share what I value in this relationship and set expectations or guidelines that I know I can live by (nothing on them to do but for myself to do). When that gets done, I would take a step back and just not expect anything else other than what has already been given to be expected. The sooner we can come to accept things for what they are, the sooner we can address the \u201cissue\u201d at hand and move on from it. \n\nJust a precaution, this is advice given by someone who is big on communication and being quite frank and upfront. I don\u2019t like \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d and walking around the bushes. It\u2019s just something I face everyday with people and found it necessary for me to be proactive in eliminating bs. This stuff works for ME and may not necessarily work for everyone.

If she's only apologizing when you message her, it might indicate that she's not prioritizing your interactions or that you're not high on her list of important contacts."}
{"full_text": "BrotisBoughtAHouse: Any Roofing Expertise? Please help.\nGreetings Reddit,\n\nMy girlfriend and I recently bought a home in the Midwest, Missouri to be specific.  It's been great, minus my lack of handy experience, but everyone has to start somewhere. \n\nWe had a lot of rain this week and as a result our ceiling sprung a [leek](http://imgur.com/nCSd0bq).  Today I decided to check it out before calling a professional.  The portion of the [roof](http://imgur.com/0Tc9gUd) that is leaking seems to be some sort of metal that is sealed (or is supposed to be).  It is on a dormer that was likely an addition at some point. The rest of the roof is shingled and looks to be in decent shape. \n\nThe problem appears to be the vents in the roof.  Here is:\n*[Vent 1](http://imgur.com/NaWBtS1)\n*[Vent 2](http://imgur.com/Vt7xqAH)\n\nIt is fairly apparent at this point where the water is coming into the house at. I picked away some of the material around Vent 1 and it looks something like this [underneath](http://imgur.com/RvdOKt0). \n\nIt seems that I need to scrape off as much of the weathered sealant as I can and replace the flashing around the vents.  Then reseal the entire dormer portion of the roof with a better product.  Am I right in this methodology or missing something?\n\nSomebody that has experienced this before: what products work best for sealing this type of roof? What about something like [this](http://flexsealproducts.com/shop/liquid/?gclid=CjwKEAjwpfC5BRCT1sKW2qzwqE0SJABkKFKR8vrBSPm1j268gQ3Ni2tXcIO6EmJD-F04Kx3Dj91bFhoC_vnw_wcB)?\nThe appearance in this location isn't very important, as it can't be seen from the ground.\n\nThanks a bunch!\nsomeonesdaddy: I laugh so hard at everyone in this thread that says call a roofer. I laugh even harder at the top comment that says call the previous homeowner and ask him to help pay for it. \n\nThese roof vents are known frequent culprits for leaking and it is no big deal. Clean the area up and apply a rubberized compound or tar. I have even used the rubberized aerosol spray before thus creating a rubber boot.\n\nI like the rubberized product called stop leak. It comes in a one gallon paint can and you apply/shape it with a putty knife. For a complex shape I will wear rubber gloves and mold it by hand. \n\nYou are a homeowner now and welcome to the big leagues.  You can't call someone everytime your toilet is clogged anymore. Go forth and be the master of your castle.\n\nYour average contractor will scare you into turning a small job into a big one. This is especially true if they think the homeowner is not very mechanically savvy. \nAbsolutelyPink: While I agree that a roofing contractor can scare you into turning a small job into a big one, this roof is in bad shape and flat or semi-flat roofing jobs are best left to a professional.  Spraying rubber isn't going to fix this one. \n\nI have roofing experience, but there are specialty products meant for flat roofs that aren't as simply as spraying rubber on the roof. It need to be redone and not just around the vents.\n\nMake sure you call a couple companies for estimates and make sure they specialize in flat roofs.  You can check with mobile home sellers in your area for referrals as well.\n\nYou will also need to fix that drywall.  Odds are, the insulation (if any) above that is wet as well.  The drywall will need replacing at a minimum.  If it's still wet, poke a couple holes in it to let the water drain.\n\nAs a temporary measure, tarp your roof until you get it repaired.\nsomeonesdaddy: I agree with you and your advice is sound. There have been times in my life when I could not afford the proper solution or the best one.\n\nI have made due with patching stuff like this in the past. In Florida where I live the roofing laws are funny because of hurricanes. If anything more than 25% of the roof is damaged you are required to get a whole new roof. \n\nI have seen plenty of good roofs complete torn off because a small section needed repair. These days homeowners are looking for a roofer  that is not going to pull a permit thus requiring inspection. \nAbsolutelyPink: I agree.  I've been in the position where I couldn't afford to have things done properly and made due with what I could afford.  It sucks.  Unfortunately, a roof is not where you want to pinch pennies. Heck, in Nevada we get winds enough to rip off a roof. This roof will leak and leak again until it's redone.  Let's just hope there hasn't been enough damage already, to cause the ceiling or roof to cave in though mold might already be of issue.\nBrotisBoughtAHouse: Thanks for the feedback.  I think I might be able to handle the flashing parts, but as others have pointed out, there are likely greater underlying problems that I don't want to risk.  It's looking like stop leak is the way to go for now for an immediate solution.  Over the next week I plan to get a slew of estimates on a more thorough fix.

It's meant a lot of redoing levels and it went from the wii version being my families favorite game to the switch version not being used at all.\nfatphotog: The switch nes app has save states, you can literally save at any moment no matter where you are.

Are you not using the save state function?\nTheKunit: It's not super Mario Brothers nes it's super Mario Brothers deluxe for the switch.\n\nAlso how do I get the nes version? I have only had my switch for a short time. Didn't even know you could get old games like that.\nfatphotog: Oh you mean new super Mario bro\u2019s delux, my bad. You can still quick save where you are on the map in that game. I forget the exact process but I think you just pause and choose quick save. It will make you quit back to the menu but will have a little balloon next to your save file meaning it\u2019s been quick saved and you\u2019ll start right from the point of the map where you quick saved. The original nes version is part of the online subscription that you can pay for. It allows you to have online access in supported games and also comes with a nes channel and a SNES channel. They each have many games from each console you can play anytime as long as you are subbed to Nintendo online. I think it\u2019s like $3 dollars a month or something.\nTheKunit: Unfortunately the quick save function either only works once or has some other odd requirement that it does not tell you about. At this point I've done the beginning of the game up to the second works at least 3 or 4 times and so far it's still forcing me to restart from the world 1 castle. I quick wave every time. Doing some research you are supposed to go back and beat an easy castle so it fully saves the game. I don't know why a basic save function is so difficult for Nintendo to figure out but it's infuriating. Super Mario party is the same way. You can't save in the game at all. If you quit during a game it's gone for good.\nfatphotog: When you\u2019re done playing, if you have gone a couple levels since the last castle or mushroom house, just quick save..Next time you want to play you start where you quick saved.\nTheKunit: OK but I've done that. If you have to play multiple sessions between castles it won't save more than the one time.\nfatphotog: I don\u2019t understand, just quick save again?\n\n*edit  Do you mean once you restart from a quick save you lose all your lives before beating a castle or finding a mushroom house? Yes if you lose all your lives after starting from a quick save, you will start at your last *real* save point. It\u2019s very, very difficult in this game to actually lose all your lives imo.\nTheKunit: https://www.gamepur.com/guides/nsmbu-deluxe-how-to-save\n\nThis is a good descriptor of the issue\nfatphotog: Right, and that article clearly states that if you don\u2019t quick save again, which is all you\u2019ll have to do, you go back to your last \u201creal\u201d save. Which is exactly what I said.\nTheKunit: Basically if you turn off the switch or put in another game the quick save function doesn't work\nfatphotog: Yes, so don\u2019t do that? The article is literally saying exactly what I\u2019m saying. This is how the very short article ends: \u201cOnce you reload the save file where the Quick Save occurred, you\u2019ll need to keep quick saving to keep your progress indefinitely before you reach an actual save point.\n\nIf you turn the system off or close the game without Quick Sav, you\u2019ll be sent back to the previous actual save you did\u2014which means you could lose tons of progress that you made through difficult levels.\u201d\nTheKunit: Dude I'm telling you it's not without quick saving like you are trying to make out. You seem hell bent on proving that an internet stranger doesn't understand how to save a freaking video game though so idk what to tell you. It's not like I've been playing video games for my entire life and know how to do basic shit like saving, pressing the menu button, or jumping.\n\nI also need help getting my undies on after my nurse assisted shower.\n\nGood riddance\nfatphotog: Holy shit bro, I\u2019m not being rude at all. I\u2019m just answering your questions. The article you posted says literally the exact same thing that I am saying.

I mean it\u2019s not hard at all to understand, so now I am going to be condescending, because you are clearly stupid.

I've read you want to install the softener right next to the main entry point for the water. This is not possible in my house so what is the next best thing?  \n2. I would want to leave our drinking water and outside spigots off the softener, so those would have to be looped out?\n3. Is it ok to just install the softener before the heater and not soften the cold water going to our bathroom/kitchen? or would it be stupid to do that and should I just soften the whole house?\n4. What is the ideal way to plumb to this softener based on the diagram below? Maybe I am just overcomplicating this.\n\nI feel good about doing the actual work, I would really like to confirm i am doing it the right way before i go through with it though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r8cp95lmxq41.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c553b8a676c855b82224eefb2905259b0a87ef1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idqc02ajmxq41.jpg?width=1724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec264596d6cd6c8feb6e6bdb6c9fac134d18805e\nTobyChan: I\u2019m in the UK so take what I say with a pinch of salt (did you see what I did there?)\n\nOver here it\u2019s normal to soften the water for the whole house expect you must leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap.  I would also leave any outdoor taps unsoftened so that you can water plants with untreated water.\nGrimResistance: &gt; leave an unsoftened water supply, typically the kitchen tap\n\nWhy is this?\nTobyChan: So you\u2019re not drinking and cooking with salty water\njohnwayne2413: Soft water is perfectly okay to drink.  I ran the numbers.\n\nTypically, water softeners add 46 mg/ liter of sodium for every 100 mg/liter of hardness minerals present in the water.\n\nThe grain per gallon (gpg) is a unit of water hardness defined as 1 grain (64.8 milligrams) of calcium carbonate dissolved in 1 US gallon of water (3.785412 L)\n\nThat works out to 17.11834802 mg calcium carbonate per liter of water.\n\nMy water is 18 grains hardness (which is very hard) so:\n\n    18 * 17.11834802 mg = 308.1302644 mg\n\nThe softener will add 141.7399216 mg sodium to 1 Liter of water (\\~34 ounces).\n\n    46 mg/L Na / 100 mg/L CaCO\u2083 = x / 308.1302644 mg CaCO\u2083\n    100x = 14,173.99 mg/L Na\n    x = 141.7399216 mg/L Na\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day\u2014that's equal to about 1 teaspoon of table salt!\n\nThis is how much water you would have to drink per day to exceed your salt intake:\n\n    (2,300 mg / 141.7399216 mg) * 34 ounces = 551 ounces of water per day\n\nIf you drank that much water in a day, ironically, you would die from hyponatremia (dilution of sodium in your blood) before you died from hypertension.\n\nTest your water hardness with a proper kit, the dropper kind, not the strips.  If your water is less hard than 18 grains then your safety margin is even higher.\n\nMost people should worry about eating potato chips or french fries adding too much salt to their body than drinking softened water.\nTobyChan: Again\u2026 read my caveat, I\u2019m from the UK and we have a limit on the sodium content on potable water supply.  Also, you have to appreciate that hardness is a relative term.  I\u2019ve seen borehole supplies that have been softened to the limit which still remain very hard.  If an untreated supply to the kitchen was added they could have softened the water further and actually got some benefit from the treatment!\n", "prompt": "Huskerfan402: Water Softener Plumbing\nHello! I am trying to install a water softener in our basement, in the utility room next to our water heater. I have a couple of questions before cutting into the plumbing. I created a diagram and included a picture below. You can access the diagram here and make edits if you'd like to help me confirm plumbing layout.

First, you'll need to locate the water supply lines coming into your home. These are usually under the basement, near the water meter or street-side connection. You'll need to shut off the main water supply before making any modifications.\n\nIn your diagram, I see you have labeled the cold water supply line as 'A' and the hot water supply line as 'B.' It's crucial to remember that water softeners typically require a bypass valve to divert the water supply during regeneration. This valve should be installed after"}
{"full_text": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for. Rather, I have once heard of a study citing that skipping breakfast can trigger an insulin response which would immediately store any and all calories ingested throughout the day into fat. \n\n\nDoes this have any credibility behind it? Does skipping breakfast help your weight loss personally? \nscreepatrol: Any studies that have weird findings about skipping meals or eating 8 meals a day or whatever are either 1) paid for their results by the industry or 2) terribly controlled. \n\nEat once a day. Eat 8 times a day. Eat only during a certain period or snack all day. Your body is great at partitioning calories and the effects of when you eat that food are somewhere between negligible and nonexistent. \n\nToo often people look at what professional bodybuilders/weightlifters/strongmen do and think that's how you succeed. Those guys are at the top level and the only thing left is to focus on the last 1%. The other 99% is controlling your calories/macros and progressive overload in training. \n\nDon't overthink this. \nSpicyThingy: Its not about the calories. Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000% which leads to better fat burning and better muscle growth. That doesnt have to do with sponsorships, it is just measureing. \nNihilii: &gt; increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over 1000%\n\n&gt;up to over\n\nSo is it up to, or is it over? Or does \"up to over 1000%\" mean anywhere between 0 and infinity? I mean that would surely be correct, but not very useful.\n\nAnd do you have any source for those revelations?\nSpicyThingy: Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass. \nNihilii: &gt;Oh no. Someones english is not perfect since its not his first language. Stop being an ass.\n\nWell, it's not my first language either, and \"up to and over\" is a classic marketing spiel (that crops up not just in english), which is why I'm giving you attitude for doing it. \n\nBut to the point - your own source, a single study mind you, so not a very strong ground to declare something as a hard fact, has found a 1000% increase in mean GH level after **5 days of fasting**. They were also **injecting the subjects with Growth-Hormone Releasing Hormone**. Based on that you say this:\n\n&gt;Eating only in a window of less than 9 hours a day increases your growth hormones up to over 1000%\n\nSo even forgetting that slip of the tongue there, you are still clearly suggesting that just intermittent fasting can give you a tenfold GH increase. This is naive at best, and purposefully misleading at worst. How can you consider that study in any way comparable to a person doing something like a typical 16/8 intermittent fasting schedule? \n\nSeriously. You either haven't read the paper you linked or you're sensationalizing this on purpose. I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nYou don't get to pull the asshole card when you're lying to people.\nthoughtihadanacct: While the 1000% claim by u/SpicyThingy may be an exaggeration (deliberate or not I can\u2019t say), it is also unfair of you to entirely discredit the study he cited based on the reasons you have given.\n\nIn figures 2 and 3 and table 1 of the study, it clearly shows that GH concentration increases from fasting even on day 1. Yes the effect on day 1 may be lower than on day 5, and again the 1000% claim may have been misleading. However you seem to be implying that the benefits of fasting with regard to HGH only happen after 5 days, and you claim that the study in no way has bearing on 16:8 fasting. The fact that there is some (albeit lower) effect on day 1 of fasting suggests that 16/8 fasting may have some benefits (albeit lower than say 5 day fasting).\n\nYou boldly state that the reserchers injected the subjects with GHRH, in an attempt to discredit the study. This was dishonest. While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed. And from fig 2 the effects of the injection do not last more than about 3 hours. The injections were done to investigate the effect of fasting on GHRH sensitivity. (True the study could have been \u201cbetter\u201d by focusing on only one thing at a time, but it stands that the injections don\u2019t negate the findings regarding GH release.)\n\nIn the end what Im saying is that it\u2019s not binary - ie it\u2019s not \u201cfasting results in 1000% increase in GH\u201d vs \u201cbullshit the study is meaningless/useless\u201d. What I\u2019m arguing is that fasting does increase GH levels to some extent. More (longer) fasting results in more increase. The exact magnitude of increase is variable and probably differs from person to person.\nNihilii: I never said the study is meaningless. I said what the guy said was misleading and even the single study he picked to support his position does not do so. You can't just sling around some numbers from a study without looking at the context. This was an extremely sloppy attempt at backing one's claims with science.\n\n&gt;While it is true that GHRH was injected, it was only injected at the end of each measuring day, after all measurements for that day were completed.\n\nWell, that's my bad then. It was not clear to me from the study design that the post-GHRH injection measurements were not included in the later analysis and I can't honestly say I read the thing front-to-back since it was pretty late that night. In-depth analysis of this study was not my point though, as I said.\nthoughtihadanacct: \u201cthe single study he picked to support his position does not do so.\u201d\n\nDepends what (you think) his position is. If his position is literally that fasting for 16 hours a day increases GH levels by 1000% in every human being, then yes the study does not support it. However if we are a bit more generous and assume his position is that fasting \u201csignificantly\u201d increases GH level in general, then I believe the study does support that position to some extent.\n", "prompt": "DarkMaster1947: Does skipping breakfast biologically increase weight gain?\nI've read previously that not eating breakfast can cause you to overeat during the day, but if you would be able to keep it under control, it could, in theory, help you burn an extra ~400 calories depending on what you would usually be having for breakfast.\n\nThis isn't really the answer I was looking for.
